Hong Kong health authorities  latest move to stop taking nasal swab samples for Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests may allow more imported cases to enter the community. but does not pose a risk to the local pandemic situation. medical experts have said.But respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu on Monday said he found it  problematic  for the city s government to opt for a less sensitive method when it had been spending a huge amount of resources on PCR testing.The government earlier announced that from Tuesday. only throat swab samples would be collected for free PCR tests at government-run sites. including those at the airport. to boost the efficiency and capacity of the services.Leung. a former chairman of the Hong Kong Medical Association s advisory committee on communicable diseases. said sensitivity could drop by one-third if only throat swabs were taken. but such a change might have  little effect  on the imported case situation.Overseas studies had shown that the sensitivity of using both samples was 97 per cent. but that of throat swabs only reached 68 per cent. he added. But at this stage. we are not too concerned about imported cases. No matter how much the [tests ] sensitivity decreases. many cases can be detected at the airport.  he told a radio programme on Monday. Even if the imported cases enter the community. it will only lead to a small-scale transmission compared with transmission within the community. The proportion of imported cases among overall infections is still less than 10 per cent. The authorities on Saturday said a throat swab was one of the specimens recommended by the National Health Commission and commonly used in mainland China for PCR tests.They added that the new arrangement had  reliable  sensitivity and could reduce the time for sample collection. as well as streamlining the collection procedure. The adjustment is conducive to enhancing the overall efficiency and boosting the capacity of testing services. while not affecting nucleic acid tests  accuracy.  a government spokesman said. adding that self-paid tests were not subject to the changes.But Leung said he could not understand why such changes were made. This is a bit problematic because the government is wasting a huge amount of resources [on PCR testing]. It also takes up much time for people to head to the testing stations. causing inconvenience.  he said. If you are conducting PCR testing. but using a less sensitive method. it is contradictory to the initial intention of public health. Leung said the amount of PCR testing could be reduced as Hong Kong was on the road to normality. adding that initiatives should be focused on protecting high-risk groups or monitoring areas with an increased prospect of transmission when the healthcare system was under pressure.He also suggested raising the threshold for compulsory testing. or replacing the PCR method with rapid antigen kits.The Health Bureau revealed earlier that from November 2020 to August this year about 37.3 million PCR tests were conducted at community centres. mobile specimen collection stations and during  restriction-testing declaration  operations. As of April. HK$5.8 billion (US$738.8 million) had been spent on this. it said.Tourism. elderly care sectors urge Hong Kong to further ease Covid rulesRicky Chiu Yin-to. an adjunct associate professor at Chinese University s school of biomedical sciences who also operates a medical diagnostics start-up that runs a few testing centres. said while forgoing nasal swabs might increase the risks of having imported cases being leaked into the community. the subsequent mandatory medical surveillance of arrivals could also detect infections.He said the new arrangement could reduce the sample collection time by two-thirds but the results would not be available any earlier.He said although the new arrangement might slightly reduce the tests  sensitivity. it was in line with the government s goal to provide ample. high-quality. speedy. accessible and affordable services.Currently. inbound travellers are required to undergo a PCR test on the first. third. fifth and seventh day of arrival as well as daily RAT tests.,Health News
A seasoned geriatrician and medical professor has been appointed as Hong Kong s first commissioner for primary healthcare as the sector undergoes the biggest reforms in a decade with a shift in focus from hospital to community care.Dr Pang Fei-chau. a clinical associate professor at the University of Hong Kong s faculty of medicine. took up the role on Monday weeks after Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced in his maiden policy address that the government would publish a primary healthcare blueprint.The blueprint aims to revamp the healthcare system from its current treatment-oriented. hospital-based structure to one that is prevention-focused and community-based. Additional resources will be invested to promote primary healthcare.A new healthcare authority with an independent budget will also be set up to ease the burden on the public sector and deliver the blueprint. a move medical industry veterans have described as the biggest reform in a decade. Dr Pang has extensive experience in public healthcare development and management.  a Health Bureau spokesman said on Monday. He will lead the Primary Healthcare Office to take forward primary healthcare development and implement relevant measures set out in the primary healthcare blueprint. including the establishment of the Primary Healthcare Authority and fostering the prevention and management of chronic diseases. New primary care authority mustn t be a ‘toothless tiger . says Sophia ChanBefore joining the university. Pang was head of human resources at the Hospital Authority. providing strategic advice and leadership on workforce operations at more than 40 facilities.He is a specialist in geriatric medicine. president of the Hong Kong College of Community Medicine and a member of the Elderly Commission. a government advisory body.Primary healthcare is the first point of contact for individuals and professionals. focusing on health promotion. disease prevention and management. and supportive care. Successful primary healthcare ultimately reduces the burden on hospitals.Previous city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced a high-level steering committee on primary healthcare development and a pilot district health centre scheme in her first policy address in 2017.Hong Kong leader John Lee sets the most targets for Labour and Welfare BureauSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. providing a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration had also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint. but its publication was delayed. due partly to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.,Health News
Hong Kong should further review its Covid-19 pandemic policies to enable inbound travellers to visit museums and watch football matches. while elderly residents in care homes should be allowed to get some fresh air and join local outdoor tours. industry representatives have said.Players from the city s tourism and elderly care sectors ramped up calls for a further relaxation of rules on Saturday while authorities announced bookings for a new version of the BioNTech vaccine would open on Sunday for children aged six months to under five years old. with the jabs available at four centres citywide.Hong Kong has been implementing a  0+3  arrangement for overseas arrivals for more than a month ever since it abolished hotel quarantine measures in September. Inbound travellers are issued an amber health code under the vaccine pass. limiting their movement citywide during a three-day medical surveillance period.Hong Kong bar owners wonder if crowds of rugby Sevens fans will ever returnIn light of the current measures. lawmaker Perry Yiu Pak-leung. who represents the tourism sector. on Saturday painted a bleak picture for his constituency. telling a radio programme that the  0+3  model was too little. too late.Yiu called the existing amber health code  outdated . arguing that inbound travellers should be allowed to visit museums and watch football matches.  The amber health code is really unreasonable. Why are arrivals allowed to work or go to school but they can t visit museums?  he said.  If they are allowed to visit museums with their masks on. it should be quite safe. Yiu also urged the government to move to a  0+0  scheme as soon as possible. along with dropping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. which he called a turn-off for overseas travellers. If overseas travellers are still required to undergo three PCR tests. it would be difficult to attract them to come to Hong Kong. I think conducting daily antigen rapid tests during the period would suffice.  he said.The lawmaker said the tourism sector was still in trouble with close to 80 per cent of travel agents only recovering a tenth of business at pre-Covid levels. He estimated Hong Kong had lost HK$1 trillion (US$127.4 billion) in tourism dollars over the past three years. based on revenue of more than HK$300 billion generated by the sector in 2018.Tourists ‘should be allowed museum entry  during Hong Kong ‘0+3  surveillanceExecutive Council member Dr Lam Ching-choi. meanwhile. urged authorities to relax visiting and outing arrangements at elderly care homes. to increase communication between such residents and their families.Currently. visitors for elderly care centres need to be triple-jabbed and produce negative PCR results from tests conducted in the past 48 hours. Some care homes also set daily guest quotas.Residents in care homes. classified as one of the most vulnerable groups amid the pandemic. have generally been barred from going out. unless in emergencies or important situations. according to government guidelines. These elderly residents are physically and mentally fatigued from the past two years of not being able to go out. I have suggested to the Social Welfare Department to further relax policies and it has said it would consider the proposals.  the government adviser told the press after an event on Saturday.Lam added there should be fewer restrictions for visits at care homes. while such facilities could copy the model of local tours in which groups head out to country parks under  closed-loop  arrangements.In an earlier segment of the same radio programme that Yiu joined. government pandemic adviser Professor David Hui Shu-cheong echoed calls to further ease restrictions. saying the move could be made in two weeks if there was no infection spike from the ongoing rugby Sevens tournament. The chances of a sharp surge are not high.  Hui said. citing the city s overall vaccination rate and immunity in the population from waves of earlier infections.The tournament. which will run until Sunday. has been billed as a major event marking the reopening of Hong Kong. alongside the recently concluded FinTech Week and Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit.Hui said it might take two weeks to find out whether the city would come out on top following infection risks posed by the string of mega events this week. He noted the number of imported coronavirus cases had remained  stable  even with hotel quarantine measures dropped. adding:  There is more room for relaxation. Hong Kong on Saturday recorded 5.111 Covid-19 infections. 494 of which were imported. and 18 additional related deaths. The city s tally stands at 1.942.707 cases and 10.457 fatalities.On vaccination for toddlers. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan urged parents to be proactive in taking advantage of the newly available BioNTech formula.The arrival of the specially diluted vaccine was first unveiled by health officials on Thursday. with authorities saying on Saturday the shots would be offered at Hong Kong Children s Hospital in Kowloon and Gleneagles Hospital on Hong Kong Island.Parents hoping to inoculate their children in the New Territories can make bookings at CUHK Medical Centre in Sha Tin and Osman Ramju Sadick Memorial Sports Centre in Kwai Chung.Hong Kong eases Covid jab rules for primary. secondary full-day classes to resume Children have weaker resistance to diseases and can fall into severe conditions should they get infected with the Covid-19 virus. They may also develop medium- to long-term after-effects following recovery.  she warned.The latest German-produced BioNTech shot can be given to children aged six months to under five years and parents are advised to leave an eight-week gap between the first and second jabs. although this period can be shortened to three weeks subject to personal needs. The third dose should be administered at least three months after the second. according to the government.Currently. only the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine is available to children as young as six months.As of Saturday. 18.7 per cent of children under two years of age and 66.8 per cent of those between three and 11 years had received a first dose of the Sinovac vaccine. Another 20.3 per cent of those aged five to 11 years had received their first BioNTech shot.Meanwhile. the Hospital Authority adjusted to the back-to-work arrangement for staff identified as close contacts of a Covid-19 case. under which employees are expected to return to work the next day the earliest if they receive a negative result on a rapid antigen test and are asymptomatic and physically fit. It will take effect from November 9.A spokesman for the authority said it adjusted the measure due to a possible surge in demand for medical services as the city faced the winter flu season. After considering demand for medical staff during the pandemic and the influenza season. and balancing infectious risks. the Hospital Authority has decided to revise the relevant work arrangements.  it said.But staff should undergo PCR tests in the first six day of being identified as a close contact and they are required to wear respirators during work hours and eat alone. according to the authority.Additional reporting by William Yiu,Health News
Hong Kong residents who were born in 2009 or after should be banned from buying cigarettes by 2027. government advisers have proposed. as they recommended a basket of measures to further shrink the smoking population.The idea of creating a  smoke-free generation  by the end of the five-year term of the new administration was proposed by the Council on Smoking and Health on Thursday.It means that when this group of residents reach 18 years old in 2027 or later. they will not be allowed to buy tobacco products. It can help achieve the ‘tobacco endgame .  council chairman Henry Tong Sau-chai said.  We hope it can be achieved before the current government finishes its term. New Zealand has adopted the same approach. banning anyone born in 2008 or after from purchasing cigarettes.The city s smoking population dropped below double-digits last year for the first time since tracking began. hitting 9.5 per cent. but Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged in his maiden policy address last year to lower the rate to 7.8 per cent in three years.The Health Bureau is expected to unveil its plan for stronger tobacco controls for public consultation early next year.Other measures proposed by the statutory body included doubling the current tobacco tax by 2023-24. which means a pack of cigarettes currently priced at HK$60 would rise to around HK$100.Hong Kong may once again allow some types of e-cigarette re-exports It is the most effective way to achieve the government s key performance indicator.  the council s executive director Vienna Lai Wai-yin said.The council said the tax should be further raised in the following two years. so a pack of cigarettes would cost HK$200 eventually by 2025-26.Lai said he hoped the long-awaited tax increase would increase incentives for quitting smoking as the last time the government raised the tobacco tax by 11.8 per cent was in 2014.The council also recommended expanding the city s non-smoking areas to cover taxi and bus stands. as well as spaces that fall within 10 meters of hospitals. schools and community facilities.Hong Kong currently does not allow smoking on public transport. including its interchanges. in hospitals. schools. parks and indoor areas of restaurants. bars and malls.Regarding the Post s previous report about the government s consideration to reverse the ban on the re-export of e-cigarettes and other heated tobacco products as a means to boost the economy. Tong opposed the possible move.Malaysia redraws anti-smoking bill amid concerns over loss of rights It is against the intention of the legislation.  Tong said.  It will pass on bad values to children. Under the amended law which took effect in April. no one can import. sell or manufacture alternative smoking products such as electronic cigarettes. heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes.The legislation also prohibits smoking products from being transshipped through Hong Kong when brought in by truck or ship for transport onwards overseas. although air transshipment cargo and transit cargo that stays on a plane or ship are exempt.Tong worried that the reverse would create a  loophole  where alternative tobacco products would slip to the community.Lawmaker Shiu Ka-fai. representing the wholesale and retail sector. said poorer smokers would not be able to afford the product after the price rose. I agree with a reasonable tax increase by following the inflation rate. or else [the frozen tax] will sound like encouraging smoking. But if the increase deviates too much. it is a discrimination against the poor as the rich will not be affected.  Shiu said.He also opposed the idea of  smoke-free generation  as the policy would limit freedom of choice. It is true that the underage should not smoke cigarettes. but adults should have the freedom of choice instead of having the government make the decision for them.  he said.The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group. which is formed by smokers. said they opposed the tax hike as smokers might seek black-market cigarettes instead of quitting the habit. adding that it would impact the city s economic recovery.,Health News
An abnormal spate of melioidosis. a fatal infectious disease. in Hong Kong might have originated from the bacterium found in the soil on top of a reservoir in West Kowloon after a government investigation found the DNA profiles highly identical.Revealing the findings on Thursday. a top microbiologist leading the investigation said it was unknown how the bacterium had been passed on to the patients. stressing the city s fresh water supply was still safe. The tests conducted on water samples collected from the reservoir in Shek Kip Mei so far all tested negative.  Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong said.  All we know is that the DNA [of patients and soil samples] are almost the same. and the soil samples were collected on top of the reservoir. Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soil. especially moist clay. and muddy water. melioidosis is an infectious disease with symptoms including fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.A total of 34 melioidosis cases have been found in Hong Kong this year. considered as unusual compared with previous years. with 23 detected in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven patients have died of the disease.Health authorities found that the cases in Sham Shui Po district were in the proximity of the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs. and a construction site at Pak Tin Estate.Among the 471 environmental samples obtained from the area. 38 of them contained the bacterium. with 32 being collected from the soil on top of the reservoirs. Four of the soil samples from the reservoir were genetically similar to the samples collected from the patients in the district.Hong Kong melioidosis outbreak: what is causing it and how can you stay safe?Yuen said the team could not tell how it spread despite conducting multiple inspections. but he highlighted several possibilities: bacterium entering the reservoir through the air vents; increase in water temperature lowering the chlorine levels in fresh water; more elderly people living in the Sham Shui Po district; and global warming increasing the volume of Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil.Apart from an earlier suggestion to increase the chlorine levels in water. the expert team also recommended the government install air filters at the air vents and some ultraviolet lamps at the reservoir.The chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. were raised last week in a bid to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicThe public. especially the elderly. was also advised to let the taps run for at least a minute before use and to boil water before drinking it. The investigation has come to an end at this stage.  Yuen said.  We have to accept that the disease has become endemic … the public need not be overly concerned if the cases do not share a common origin. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. of the Centre for Health Protection. said authorities were revising the laws to include melioidosis as a statutory notifiable disease. which meant doctors would have to report suspected or confirmed cases.Two cases of melioidosis were also reported at Eastern Hospital last month. Au said results of whole genome sequencing were different from the Sham Shui Po cluster. We believe that the two cases are not related to the Sham Shui Po cluster and are sporadic cases that are found locally from time to time.  he noted.Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen added that different genome sequencing results meant the cases did not have a common source of infection. therefore there was no cause for concern.Last week. 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin Estate who had chronic illnesses were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. Eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam said there might be multiple sources of infection including inhaling of contaminated soil or drinking of compromised water.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosis It is difficult to determine the actual transmission route. You can only raise suspicions as the samples collected around the reservoir [were positive].  he said.Lam warned that the residents living next to the reservoir who suffered from chronic illness. especially diabetes. should only use boiled water for drinking or brushing teeth.Respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu suggested the authorities testing the elderly or those with chronic illnesses in Pak Tin Estate check whether they had been exposed as well.,Health News
A top Hong Kong microbiologist has retracted seven research papers published between eight to 18 years ago after image errors were discovered. but he insisted the mistakes did not affect research conclusions and had nothing to do with his work on severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) or the Covid-19 pandemic.Yuen Kwok-yung. 66. a chair professor of infectious diseases at the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and who discovered Sars. told the Post on Wednesday he had made a  supervisory oversight .He expressed regret over the use of some images for the seven journal articles involved. for which he was the team leader. As the last corresponding author of these research papers. I did commit a mistake which was a supervisory oversight … It s nobody s fault but mine.  he said. I regret what happened and have been doing everything possible to correct the scientific record according to the highest professional standards. Leading Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung gets Covid-19The microbiologist on August 1 decided to ask journal editors to retract the research papers the same day he got emails from an unknown party who alerted him about the similarity of some test strip images for Western Blot. a test to show whether some animals or humans had antibodies against a certain virus. bacteria or fungi.The articles for which Yuen was either the lead author or co-author involved antibody detection for a particular kind of virus. bacteria or fungi on animals or humans.They showed a compilation of images of the Western Blot test strips to indicate whether the subject had the relevant antibodies. Similar to the rapid antigen test for Covid-19. the test strip shows one line if the result is positive and no line if it is negative.One article was about the discovery of a novel bottlenose dolphin coronavirus. and another concerned the identification and genome analysis of three novel viruses in fruit bats from mainland China. After being alerted about the similarity of the images used. I immediately used a forensic image software to examine the images and I found some of them strikingly similar to the others.  Yuen said.  I believe some of the images had been mistakenly mixed up by my research team colleagues so I immediately called for the retraction of the research papers. The error in each paper might have been accidentally and unintentionally introduced by one of the co-authors 8 to 18 years ago.  he said.Yuen explained the errors were difficult to spot. except by image experts or specialist software. but at that time they did not have such advanced forensic image equipment to verify if the images had been reused.All the serum specimens and other samples had been discarded seven years after publication. so the experiments could not be repeated. he added. We have no choice but to retract these papers. despite the fact that the errors did not affect the main conclusions of the papers or management of patients.  Yuen said.Yuen emphasised that none of the papers were related to his mainstream research. such as the discovery of Sars. Covid-19 or Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).He said he had also informed HKU s faculty of medicine about the image errors and the retraction of the articles.Hong Kong health chief to weigh call for natural Covid immunity; 3.762 cases loggedYuen said the faculty had later carried out an investigation and decided he had made a  supervisory oversight . adding that. from now on. his team would screen all their publications with advanced image software.Yuen. who has published about 1.100 articles over 35 years. said he felt upset about the mistakes. but that he did not think they would affect his reputation. We used a period of six months to two years each for writing these retracted articles and. of course. I feel sad about the retraction.  he said. But nothing is more important than telling the truth. The most important thing is setting the scientific record straight. An HKU spokeswoman said the university had acknowledged a recent allegation that some images used in the seven papers were  more similar than expected . and it then set up an evaluation panel to review the cases in accordance with established procedures. After careful deliberation. the university has concluded that there was indeed some evidence of the alleged mistakes in handling images in the papers. The corresponding authors received an official reprimand for their mistakes in the respective research work.  she said.  The university will also be imposing sanctions on the responsible authors. The spokeswoman added HKU was committed to upholding the highest standards in research and integrity. All HKU researchers must be diligent and meticulous in their research endeavours and equip themselves with the best research practices to prevent similar incidents from happening again.  she said.,Health News
Hong Kong s former health secretary will lead a community care programme in which 1.000 nursing students will serve more than 10.000 elderly residents and educate them about online medical care services.The University of Hong Kong s school of nursing on Wednesday launched the pilot round of the Generations Connect Project under which more than 50 students will receive elderly care training and visit about 100 elderly residents living in Wah Fu Estate this month.Former secretary for health Sophia Chan Siu-chee. who now teaches at the university s school of nursing. is the director of the programme. In the midst of an ageing population. I think it is important that we have our students who are savvy in using digital health devices communicating with the elderly.  she said. And also in the midst of the Covid-19 [pandemic]. actually many elders have been stuck at home and do not go out. so therefore their psychosocial and physical well-being is being tarnished to a certain extent. So I think this programme is very timely in getting our students to communicate [with the elderly]. The project. sponsored by the Sino Group and Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation. will involve collaboration with 11 social welfare organisations in its second phase from January 2023 until the end of 2024.Almost one-third of Hong Kong elderly felt lonely during fifth Covid wave: surveyIn the second phase. more than 1.000 bachelor s and master s students at the school of nursing will work with 10.000 elderly residents in need across 18 districts in the city through regular home visits. phone calls and video conferences. in an effort to enhance their psychosocial and mental well-being. The project will also be integrated into various nursing courses.Students will teach such residents how to operate an online platform especially designed for the elderly to access health-related information. as well as how to use government e-health services. to increase their digital literacy.Chan said one of the project s aims was to promote primary healthcare. which focused on prevention measures and centred around the community. adding that some of the topics included encouraging the elderly to exercise. Under an ageing population … our nursing students and society as a whole have to face the fact that many of our residents are elderly.  she said. adding that the project would help the elderly build health habits that would prevent them from developing conditions that might add to the burden on the healthcare system.The project will also focus on increasing such residents  knowledge on Covid-19 prevention and evidence-based interventions.Data will also be collected during the initiative and analysed by the university. which will then publish reports and recommendations for the planning of elderly care services and nurse training. We hope we can do a good job in data analysis for the sake of the development of elderly services. preventive measures in the community and primary healthcare.  she said. We also wish to provide new [elderly care] models so that under the drastic change of the healthcare system. nurses can be well-prepared. as well as offering them demonstration and guidance during professional training.,Health News
Hong Kong has been dealing with a mysterious spate of melioidosis cases since August. with a cluster emerging in the Sham Shui Po district.The Post takes a look at what health authorities have found out so far and what residents should do about it.1. What is melioidosis?Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soils. especially moist clay. and muddy water.It is usually spread through contact with contaminated soil or surface water. especially via skin abrasions and wounds. as well as inhaling contaminated dust or water droplets and drinking contaminated water. While person-to-person transmission is uncommon. it can happen through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected individual.Melioidosis can manifest as conditions such as a localised infection. pneumonia. meningoencephalitis and sepsis. which is an extreme response to infections where the immune system starts to attack healthy tissue. Depending on the location of infection. symptoms include fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.The incubation period commonly ranges from two to four weeks. The fatality rate is between 40 and 75 per cent. It can be treated with antibiotics. but there is no vaccine targeting the bacteria.People with underlying diseases including diabetes. lung disease. liver disease. renal disease. cancer. or immunosuppression are more likely to be infected. Workers in agricultural. laboratory and healthcare are also susceptible to exposure.‘Vietnamese time bomb  disease: US deaths linked to Walmart aromatherapy sprayThe disease is considered endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It can also affect animals such as sheep. goats and pigs.2. How is the disease affecting Hong Kong?An abnormal number of melioidosis cases. 34 so far. have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. with 23 found in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven deaths were reported.The city logged 17 cases last year. An average of 10 cases have been detected each year over the past five years. according to official statistics.According to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). between August and October. 20 people. of which 16 were aged 60 or above. living in 19 blocks across Sham Shui Po were infected. They have no contact history with each other. The buildings are all located within a 1km radius of the Lee Cheng Uk and Pak Tin estates.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicMost of the patients from the Kowloon cluster over the past three months were immunocompromised because of underlying diseases. according to the centre.Among the 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin estates who had chronic illnesses and were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria on Saturday.It was believed that they might have had an asymptomatic infection in the past after being exposed to soil or water contaminated with the bacterium.3. Have the authorities found the cause of the outbreak?On October 21. the CHP revealed that DNA traces of the bacterium were found in the four soil samples from the construction site at Pak Tin Estate. but it could not be reproduced in a laboratory because of its low bacterial load. None of the infected people known at the time had worked. entered or walked near the area.After finding positive swab samples obtained from a water pipe and the surface of a flowerpot at a patient s home in Sham Shui Po. health authorities last Tuesday inspected the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs in the district with University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung.Although no positive readings were reported during the inspection. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. CHP s principal medical and health officer. said one direction of the investigation was whether the patients had drunk or come into contact with contaminated water.Considering another possibility of the spread. Yuen s team had also brought some cheap face masks from the district to see if they were contaminated.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam previously said wind and rain might have brought the bacteria to the air. which was then breathed in by the patients.4. What did the government do to contain the spread?Health authorities announced a plan to make melioidosis a statutory notifiable disease. meaning doctors would be required to report cases to officials.The Water Supplies Department said last week it had increased chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak. It was also considering Yuen s suggestion of installing UV light to eliminate more bacteria.Hong Kong doctors may need to report melioidosis cases. 3 new patients confirmedCalcium hydroxide. which can be used as a disinfectant of the bacterium. was also added to the soil at the construction site at Pak Tin Estate to protect workers and those living nearby.5. Should we be worried?Respiratory disease specialist Dr Leung Chi-chiu said the chance of having a major outbreak was small as the disease was rarely transmitted from human to human.As 38 per cent of the workers tested were found to be infected. he believed that the contamination at the construction site was severe. adding that the 10 workers were unlikely to develop symptoms unless they were severely immunocompromised.He said it could not be ruled out that residents at the public housing estate were also heavily exposed. adding that the government should test high-risk residents to look at the infection rate.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosisCiting previous studies. infectious diseases expert Lam noted that only a small number of people who come in contact with the bacterium causing melioidosis will suffer an infection.He said most patients were usually older. and there was no need to panic for healthy people with a normal level of immunity as they would not catch the disease after contact with low levels of the bacteria.He said the best way for people to protect themselves was to boost their immune systems.6. How should we protect ourselves?Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam warned all residents. regardless of their medical condition. against using or consuming unboiled water found near soil that could be contaminated.He said the public should also avoid using such water for other purposes such as washing. rinsing mouths or brushing teeth.He added that patients with chronic illnesses. especially diabetes. should be  extra careful .Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen also suggested the elderly as well as those with chronic illnesses run the tap for a minute first before using the water to brush their teeth. shower or drink.According to the CHP. the public can also take precautions such as wearing gloves and boots during activities that could involve contact with soil or water. washing or showering after exposure to possibly contaminated water or soil. cleaning wounds as soon as possible. covering cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings and washing hands with liquid soap after handling soils.Additional reporting by Harvey Kong,Health News
Hong Kong will host its second Asia global health summit following a string of other high-profile events this week. with professionals in the field from around the world outlining their views on how to create a sustainable post-Covid pandemic future for the sector.The summit. to be held on November 10 to 11. will be one of the highlights of the city s first International Healthcare Week. organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).Can Hong Kong s FinTech Week crypto announcements steal Singapore s thunder?HKTDC executive director Margaret Fong Shun-man on Monday said healthcare and life sciences had become a global concern since the pandemic. adding the event could help Hong Kong cement its leading position in the region s growing industry. From our work in promoting technology and medical devices over the years. we see that Hong Kong has considerable strengths in both the upstream and downstream elements of the healthcare. medical and life sciences ecosystem that can support the city in developing into a leading global healthcare and life sciences hub.  she said.

Hong Kong s new primary care authority will avoid becoming a  toothless tiger  if it cuts red tape and empowers community nurses to do more for patients. former health chief Sophia Chan Siu-chee has said.Now a professor of nursing at the University of Hong Kong. she said officials aiming to transform the city s health landscape must also act to woo nurses and retain talent. Last year alone. 2.600 nurses quit the public sector.Chan welcomed Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu s recent announcement of major reforms in the public health sector. including the creation of a new independent authority for primary care. It can t be a toothless tiger. primary care reforms are what the city has long awaited.  she told the Post. in her first media interview since leaving office earlier this year.Stressing the need for more funding too. she said:  In the long term. primary care can improve public health and reduce the burden on hospitals. But sometimes. you must invest first before you can reap the rewards. During her tenure as secretary for food and health. Chan was an advocate for increasing primary healthcare in the community. focused on raising awareness about health issues. disease prevention and management. and supportive care that all help to reduce the burden on public hospitals.7 key takeaways from Hong Kong leader John Lee s first policy addressSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. offering a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint which Chan was involved with closely. but its publication was delayed partly by disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In his policy address on October 19. city leader Lee unveiled a raft of measures on primary care. the highlight being the creation of the new authority.Chan expected some teething problems. saying it could be hard to reshuffle existing primary care services. such as those for the elderly and women. and bring them under one roof at the authority.The changes would also affect many patients. especially the elderly who were used to going to a hospital to see a specialist. she said. For hospitals. transferring patients to community health centres involved extra paperwork.In promoting primary care. much would depend on whether staff at the community health services could show patients that they benefited from going there instead of to hospitals.Hong Kong s public hospitals to offer up to HK$6 million home loan to staff The burden on hospitals will remain the same if patients insist on queuing up there for various services.  Chan said.  So the local nurses have to act as health coaches and coordinators with power to send a patient back to a specialist if needed. Besides her academic duties at HKU. Chan also took on a new role advising university president Xiang Zhang on promoting community health and other priorities.Since leaving office. she has been spending time training and developing career paths to attract new talent to community nursing.She said community nurses needed different skills compared with those in hospitals. and had to communicate well as health coaches.Chan said she was pleased that Lee outlined plans to attract overseas-trained nurses. following on earlier reforms under her watch to woo foreign doctors. We have to break down barriers and obstacles and simplify entry procedures.  she said.Given the high attrition rate among nurses. she urged officials to look at allowing those trained overseas to work in Hong Kong without having to sit local exams and undergo internships.Hong Kong s scheme for foreign-trained doctors gets dozens of applicationsWith other plans such as a pilot scheme to subsidise residents being screened for chronic diseases. Chan said she understood the need for a  step-by-step  approach and guarding against the abuse of subsidies.Ultimately. however. she felt it was important to promote and entrench the shift to primary healthcare and emphasise the benefits for all. Even healthy people have risk factors they should be aware of. and the system should allow them to take control of their own health.  she said.,Health News
Hong Kong s health minister has moved to invalidate more than 20.000 coronavirus vaccination exemptions issued by seven doctors suspected of supplying fake certificates under new powers granted to him after the law was amended on Wednesday.A government spokesman said the medical certificates would officially become invalid from November 9. adding that the seven doctors could offer written representations to defend their cases before November 1.He also urged those who held invalidated certificates to consult doctors to ensure they either received inoculations or continued to enjoy the exemption. Anyone using a false instrument knowingly may contravene the Crimes Ordinance.  he warned. adding the maximum penalty upon conviction was 14 years  jail.  Members of the public are urged not to defy the law and not to use exemption certificates obtained through improper means. The announcement came hours after Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said that amending the law could ensure  sufficient legal basis  for the government to assume its duty in pandemic work.The government last week lost a legal battle on revoking the exemptions. with the High Court ruling the health secretary had no power to do so.Dismissing accusations the administration sought to override the judicial process. Lo said:  It s not whether the government wins or someone else wins. We have to make sure all citizens win in this battle against Covid. The legislative amendments that empower the health chief to void exemption certificates deemed to be problematic took effect on Wednesday under negative vetting – meaning lawmakers vote on them after they have taken effect – but authorities are facing a fresh round of legal challenges on wider Covid-19 policies.Hong Kong health chief will have power to nullify Covid exemptions from WednesdayFormer civil servant and serial litigant Kwok Cheuk-kin. who won a legal battle last week that prevented the government from invalidating the documents. told the Post he would lodge a wider judicial review on Thursday against the vaccine pass and Covid-19 risk-exposure  Leave Home Safe  app.Lo addressed lawmakers in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. a day after the government revealed it would not appeal against the court ruling but would instead amend the law to target the jab exemptions in question. The legislative [amendments] are to give sufficient legal basis for the government to assume our responsibilities in our anti-epidemic work.  Lo said in defence of the move.He was referring to amendments under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. which empowers authorities to make regulations  for the purposes of preventing. combating or alleviating the effects of the public health emergency and protecting public health .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeThe High Court ruled that the government did not have the legal power to cancel more than 20.000 medical certificates granted by doctors suspected of malpractice.Holders of the documents are exempted from the vaccine pass scheme requiring residents to have had three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter premises citywide such as restaurants or bars.Six doctors have been arrested on suspicion of issuing the exemptions without proper medical diagnosis. with a seventh practitioner still wanted by police.Retired civil servant Kwok Cheuk-kin meets the press after winning his legal challenge last week. Photo: Yik Yeung-manKwok on Wednesday said that if he won his potential legal challenge. society would no longer have to dwell on the issue  once and for all . I will challenge whether [vaccine pass policies] are necessary. Hongkongers can only access designated premises by using this app but people coming for the financial summit are not required to. This is against the Basic Law as residents are equal before the law.  he argued.He was referring to the Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit. set for between November 1 and 3. during which attendees can visit designated venues despite the need to observe three days of medical surveillance – a wider discretion that ordinary inbound travellers are not entitled to.Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun. an associate professor and administrative law specialist at City University of Hong Kong. argued that the government should appeal against the ruling. So I think this case deserves to go all the way to the Court of Final Appeal. so that clearer rationales can be laid down.  she said. In cases involving significant public interest. the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal had often ruled differently. Lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen. chairman of the centrist Third Side party. agreed. saying that the latest move gave the impression that the government wanted to  circumvent the judiciary .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeAlex Lam Chi-yau. of the concern group Hong Kong Patients  Voices. separately told a radio programme on Wednesday morning that while he acknowledged the government s power to amend legislation. authorities failed to show respect for individual rights when they overturned the court ruling.Calling the government move a spectacle. he said the 20.000 residents affected by the cancellation of exemptions had been taken on  a roller-coaster ride .He added while some had managed to get hold of separate exemptions later. they were still required under Hospital Authority rules to have had at least one vaccine jab. which could expose them to risks.Lawmaker Doreen Kong Yuk-foon – who previously said that there was lack of legal grounds for authorities to invalidate such a large number of certificates – urged the government to be more forthcoming in explaining the rationale behind the amendment to the law.She also expressed surprise the government had extended the vaccine pass scheme until next year. saying the measure would affect the city s road back to normality.,Health News
The highly transmissible XBB could become the next dominant strain of Covid-19 in Hong Kong. but the population s level of hybrid immunity should stave off severe illnesses. health experts have said.The city has recorded 140 XBB infections since an overseas traveller became the first known carrier on October 10. but the number still pales beside other cases involving dominant strains in the city. such as BA.4 or BA.5. They accounted for 95.1 per cent of local cases over the past two weeks. compared with less than 0.1 per cent involving XBB. XBB could be the next dominant strain in Hong Kong.  said Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai. a top infectious disease expert at the University of Hong Kong.  Nevertheless. XBB is a recombinant of BA 2.75 and 2.10.1. Most people in Hong Kong have been infected with Omicron BA.2 or BA.5 before. plus [they have] a very high vaccination rate. Therefore. [they have] very high hybrid immunity. The immunity. coupled with a lack of evidence showing XBB was more virulent than other strains. had led Hung to believe the threat it posed to residents was minimal even if it became the dominant one due to its high transmissibility. Therefore. it will not be a threat to the healthcare system in Hong Kong in the winter.  he said.But the potential of XBB to drive up infections had been demonstrated in Singapore. where the strain fuelled a surge to 60.000 cases for the week ending October 17. up from about 41.000 logged the week before. Authorities in the city state also said they expected the daily figure to peak at about 15.000 by mid-November.Singaporean officials said XBB was now the predominant subvariant circulating in the community. accounting for 54 per cent of local cases in the week to October 9. up from 22 per cent the previous week. The strain has popped up in at least 17 countries. including Australia. Japan and Denmark.In ‘post-Covid  Singapore. doctors warn against complacency as XBB cases surgeDr Gilman Siu Kit-hang. an associate professor at the department of health. technology and informatics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. said research on XBB had shown it was more capable of evading vaccine-derived protections than other known variants. but inoculation could stave off severe symptoms.The scholar also explained that while Hong Kong s recent fifth coronavirus wave was driven by the subvariant BA. 2. the early round of infections would provide  some immunity  against XBB.Hong Kong health officials renew push to sign up elderly for Covid jabsSiu added that the coronavirus was also likely to mutate. with more variants expected to emerge during the coming winter. This winter is the first winter since many places around the world returned to normal. Variants are expected to keep emerging.  he said.Dr Leung Chi-chiu. a respiratory disease specialist. said real-world evidence on the high transmissibility of the XBB strain was not yet available and cautioned against forming premature judgments regarding the subvariant. At this stage. the immune escape is based on laboratory experiments … This does not necessarily mean they have an actual growth advantage in the real world.  he said. referring to the ability of a virus to evade detection by antibodies.  There is as yet no danger signals of the rapid spread of such a variant in our community. Hong Kong is finally axing hotel quarantine – here s what you need to knowLeung also argued the emergence of strains such as XBB should not dissuade local authorities from fully reopening Hong Kong s borders and ending the three days of surveillance required under the government s  0+3  regime.,Health News
The first journalist to be found guilty of breaching rules on searching a Hong Kong government vehicle registry on Monday lost an appeal against her conviction.Bao Choy Yuk-ling. 39. was fined HK$6.000 (US$769) last year for knowingly making false statements to the Transport Department over her use of its car registration database while making a documentary investigating police s response to a mob attack during the 2019 anti-government protests.A magistrate found her guilty by rejecting journalism as justification for searching the official records. a ruling which has sparked concerns about the stifling of press freedom when the ­government was already tightening access to information.Journalist fined for data breach may have made ‘mistake : Hong Kong judgeChoy. a former journalist with public broadcaster RTHK. twice conducted searches in mid-2020 to track down the owners of vehicles believed to have supplied weapons to 100 men in white tops to attack anti-government protesters at Yuen Long railway station on July 21. 2019.Choy co-produced an episode of the ­television show Hong Kong Connection. which won a Human Rights Press Award. organised by Hong Kong s Foreign Correspondents  Club. and the Kam Yiu-yu Press Freedom Award. held by the Hong Kong Journalists Association. RTHK declined both awards. citing an ongoing review of its operations.One of the car owners. despite not being named in the show. filed a complaint to police leading to Choy s arrest in November 2020.Principal Magistrate Ivy Chui Yee-mei ruled in April 2021 that Choi had been dishonest when she cited  traffic and transport-related matters  as her reason for accessing the department s online database. even though her true intention was to use the data for the report.The option is one of only three available to people looking for information. the others being  legal proceedings  and the  sale and purchase of vehicles . Journalism is not an option.The Journalists Association has urged authorities to allow press inspection of the vehicle registry. a request dismissed by authorities.Instead. the department introduced an email notification system in January last year allowing car owners to  take precautionary actions  whenever a third party seeks access to their personal details in the database.The association criticised the move as another attempt to undermine investigative reporting and the public s right to information.,Polictics News
Officials hailed the return of the rugby Sevens as  a resounding success  on Sunday. as the city s leader joined tens of thousands of fans at a packed Hong Kong Stadium to watch Australia s thrilling last-gasp win.After more than three years away. the tournament lived up to its reputation as Hong Kong s landmark sporting event. and the tears on the faces of the Australian players spoke volumes about what it meant to them.Calling it  one of the most popular sporting events in Asia . Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the tournament was  living proof  that the city had returned to the world stage.After hosting global financial leaders for a three-day summit before the Sevens. and with a series of other events on the horizon. including the Hong Kong Squash Open later this month. Lee said the city was  ushering in a new chapter . The Pearl of the Orient is shining brighter than ever.  he said in a social media post accompanied by a video clip he narrated.And while the Sevens had been absent since 2019 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia turned the clock back even further on Sunday. winning in Hong Kong for the first time in 34 years and unseating a Fiji team that had not lost a final in the city since 2014.In many ways. Nathan Lawson s thrilling try to seal a 20-17 win was a fitting end to a tournament that has roared life back into Hong Kong.Australia s stunning Hong Kong Sevens upset chimes with year of changeAlthough neither Lee nor his deputy. Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki. spoke to the media during their time at the Sevens. Chan said in an online post that the government would continue to review the Covid-19 situation and relax various measures when appropriate. This will allow the public to resume normal life as soon as possible. and accelerate Hong Kong s speedy convergence with the international community and continue to show its glory.  he added.In contrast to the strict measures of the past three years. the three days of the Sevens have been a more relaxed affair. and even Lee. who was spotted enjoying a beer with colleagues and organisers. joined in the party atmosphere.From the costumed ranks of Power Rangers. Teletubbies. and a group of Ronald McDonalds who were  loving it . the electric crowd prompted Hong Kong player Russell Webb to say  it was so loud  he could not tell the ground was short of capacity. It s great to see it back.  Paul Teague. a Hong Kong resident. said.  It s not quite as full on as it has been in previous years. but it s actually better than what I expected. It s just what the city needs right now. A World Rugby spokesman thanked Hong Kong officials for delivering a  safe. secure and highly enjoyable event  and said the organisation was already looking forward to returning in March. for the last tournament of the season which they hoped would be  bigger and better . With a happy. vibrant atmosphere in the stands. scintillating world-class rugby on the pitch. and a sense of joy and community all around. the return of the Cathay Pacific/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens was a resounding success.  the spokesman said.Organisers will certainly hope the restrictions on crowd numbers. which were limited to 85 per cent capacity by Covid measures. are lifted. but they would have been buoyed by the 65.000 that passed through the gates over the past three days.The Hong Kong Rugby Union estimated that the cost of hosting the event was likely to be near HK$50 million (US$6.4 million). and while in the past the Sevens had pumped HK$400m into the economy. the lack of overseas spectators was expected to cut that by about HK$100m or more.Kiwis fall short at Hong Kong Sevens but still emerge as victorsVendors. too. did a roaring trade. with the boss of Ebeneezer s Kebabs & Pizzeria reporting a boom at its concession stand inside the stadium.Sunny Rekhani. one of the chain s managing directors and owners. said they had sold almost 1.200 kebabs by midafternoon on Sunday. and were selling 1.400 slices of pizza per day. We found business to be very good and it is still ongoing. today is almost 25 to 35 per cent better than yesterday.  he said.Robbie McRobbie. the Hong Kong Rugby Union s CEO. said the event was about more than rugby. and he hoped its success would help rescue a sports event industry hit hard by the pandemic. There are people whose livelihoods have been devastated and if we don t resurrect the sector now. these people will be gone. they ll be doing other jobs.  he said.  We need to get things going now or there ll be more of a drain of talent. While there was no official count of overseas fans. at least one set enjoyed their day at the finals. with Reiner Du Plessis. a visitor from South Africa. hosted by organisers after being turned away on Friday because he was still under medical surveillance.The 38-year-old said the past three days with the amber code had been  difficult . but he was happy he and his friends were provided with  proper food  at the corporate box.Spectators pull out all the stops and party on last day of Hong Kong SevensDu Plessis admitted that the letdown was their own fault. saying that he and his fellow travellers had not intended to cause  any havoc . We have to respect the government s regulations … at least I m having fun now.  he said.McRobbie said he was glad for the  dark days  to be over. but much more work had to be done to revive the sporting events sector. To me. it s more than the HKRU. it s a sports event industry getting going again … A lot have already left the sector. We need to get things going now or there ll be more of a drain of talent. We need to retain that in the events sector or it will be more difficult to bring it back in future. Additional reporting by Harvey Kong and Rachel Yeo,Polictics News
A high-level banking summit held last week has shown to the world that Hong Kong has returned to normality. the city s finance chief has said. as overseas attendees added that their experiences during the trip differed from foreign media reports.Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Sunday also said in his weekly blog that the city needed to strengthen investment by wooing firms and talent amid a pessimistic economic outlook this year. with the latest gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter shrinking by 4.5 per cent compared with the same period during the previous year.The Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit. which wrapped up last Thursday. involved more than 200 financiers from 120 global firms. with 40 of them being chief executives.Chan said some participants had revealed they had learned more about the latest developments in the global markets and the city s unique advantages during their trip. Some of them have visited Hong Kong several times in recent years. while quite a lot of them have returned for the first time after several years.  he said.  They say their first-hand experiences in Hong Kong were different from what they have seen in foreign media outlets.  The summit has also achieved another goal – to show the world Hong Kong s openness and its return to normality. We will hold the investment summit next year as well. The gathering of the world s top financiers. organised by the Monetary Authority. the city s de facto central bank. was part of a series of high-profile international events hosted last week to announce Hong Kong s comeback after nearly three years of Covid-19 pandemic curbs. following anti-government protests in 2019.Hong Kong finance summit ends on upbeat note as bankers head back to businessOther events also included FinTech Week. which concluded on Friday. and the Hong Kong Sevens. which began on Friday and finishes on Sunday.

Hongkongers who emigrated to Britain have welcomed the country s first Asian prime minister. Rishi Sunak. although some admitted being taken aback by the political turmoil there.Sunak. 42. a multimillionaire married to an Indian tech billionaire s daughter. became Britain s third prime minister in just a matter of months when he took office in October.He faces a huge challenge in uniting his divided Conservative Party. fending off opposition calls for a general election. and dealing with rising inflation and a massive economic crisis.Fewer Hongkongers seeking asylum in Britain as other migration options open upFor Matthew Cheung. 23. a part-time social media executive who moved to Britain with his parents and younger brother last year under the British National (Overseas) visa scheme. the appointment of a person of colour as prime minister was good news and inspiring too.He said it showed British society becoming more inclusive.  With the changing environment. maybe it s a good chance for Hongkongers to get into British politics. This is going to be our country.  he added.However. the fast turnover of leaders left his mother. Ivy Cheung. 53. feeling uneasy. We come from Hong Kong where we cannot make any kind of change. But here. too much can change. I don t know if it s good or not.  she said.But despite how  messy  Britain seemed. she felt it was still better than Hong Kong or mainland China and was confident the government would move forward in time.For Matthew. the political chaos showed democracy and accountability in action.He said he thought it was a good thing that Sunak s predecessor Liz Truss overturned her economic policies and eventually quit. once she realised how much of a mess she had made. That is a good thing. because if she cannot lead the government and people are angry about it. she s got to step down. That is one thing that is quite different compared to when we were in Hong Kong.  he said.The family decided to leave after Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong in June 2020 and overhauled the city s election systems.Ivy Cheung. who used to work in customer relations. said she and her husband. Johnny. who worked in logistics in Hong Kong. were concerned about their two sons  future.They moved to Manchester in August last year and are among 133.124 Hongkongers who had their BN(O) visas approved so far.Britain introduced the new pathway to immigration for the city s residents as a response to Beijing imposing the national security law. Successful applicants and their dependents are allowed to live. work. and study in the country for up to five years. after which they can apply for citizenship.Like many in Britain. Lilian Lau. 47. wondered if Sunak s wealthy background would prevent him from understanding the difficulties faced by ordinary people. such as the impact of rising energy and food costs. She said most Hongkongers in Britain were middle class.She works for Hong Kong Well UK. a group with around 200 volunteers originally from Hong Kong who help newly arrived immigrants navigate the British system and get information about services available.The former liberal studies teacher moved to Oxford in August last year with her husband and two sons. aged 12 and 15. She said her husband. a former IT analyst. was worried about how Hong Kong s changing political landscape might affect their sons.Lau said Britain s special visa scheme was generous. but Hongkongers arriving in the country could use more support such as training courses or counselling.Some former teachers and social workers found it hard to understand how the British system worked and she knew of trained social workers who chose to work in lower-paid jobs such as care workers instead. They feel nervous to enter the same profession. so they choose to be support workers.  she said.Losing them young: Hongkongers in early 20s are biggest emigrating groupTraining courses on the British medical. welfare and education system would help Hongkongers to continue in their professions after arriving in Britain. she added.Last year. the British government introduced a £43 million (US$59 million) package which included setting up 12 welcome hubs across the country to help new arrivals from Hong Kong with housing. education and jobs.With the rising cost of food and heating bills.

Ting Wang-leung. a political lecturer at the University of Reading. expected economic growth to be his priority. and that could include seeking closer economic ties with China.

Hong Kong is set to expand a ban on feeding wild animals to cover the entire city by the end of this year in a move aimed at tackling a rapid growth in the population of wild boars.A government spokesman on Friday said authorities had gazetted a legislative amendment to expand the ban. which would be tabled in the Legislative Council on Wednesday for  negative vetting  and come into effect on December 31. Negative vetting  refers to a process in which urgent legislation could take effect before facing scrutiny from lawmakers.According to the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance. a wild animal is any non-domestic animal. Stray cats and dogs are not considered wild animals under the law. while the legal status of pigeons remains uncertain.Currently. the Feeding Ban Area under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance covers only five natural areas. such as the Lion Rock. Kam Shan. and Shing Mun country parks. as well as part of the Tai Mo Shan Country Park and part of the Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve.Apart from expanding the area covered. the spokesman also said that the Agriculture. Fisheries and Conservation Department was planning to further amend the relevant ordinance to increase the penalty for illegal feeding. and also introduce a fixed fine to enhance the deterrent effect.At present. anyone who violates the Feeding Area Ban could be fined up to HK$10.000 (US$1.273). while those caught feeding wild pigs outside the areas listed in the ordinance could face a penalty of HK$1.500 under anti-littering regulations.Boar war: Hong Kong authorities propose HK$100.000 fine for feeding wild animalsBut under a citywide proposal by authorities in June. violators could soon be fined up to HK$100.000 and jailed for a year. The government also recommended a HK$5.000 fixed penalty ticket for less serious offences. which it said was the highest among all the current fixed penalties related to contamination in public places.As wild boars were often seen looking for food in residential areas in recent years. pro-establishment politicians have urged the government to take more drastic measures to stop the animals from disturbing people s lives. Their proposals included sending boars to desolate islands and banning residents from feeding them.The department spokesman also described feeding as  the main cause of wild pig nuisance in recent years . and said tougher measures needed to be adopted. Apart from conducting capture and humane dispatch operations to reduce the number of wild pigs at nuisance sites. the government also needs to curb wild pig feeding.  he said. adding introducing such restrictions would reduce incentives for wild pigs to linger in urban areas.The spokesman added that the expansion of the Feeding Ban Area to cover the entire city was  necessary  and that the department expected the measure to substantially decrease any nuisance caused by feeding wild pigs.Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee. a lawmaker and the convenor of the Executive Council. a key decision-making body. welcomed the move. Boars are everywhere. We ve seen them on Kennedy Road. in Shum Wan. at Ocean Park and at the Peak. The big ones are quite scary. and there are little pigs too.  she said. referring to the places under her Hong Kong Island West constituency.Legislator Chan Hok-fung. of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. said he had called for a citywide ban for a long time. But there are still issues with this ban. because officials told us that the feeding of pigeons. cats and dogs would not be covered by the ban as these are domesticated animals.  he said. We are concerned because some people feeding wild pigs could make it an excuse and say they were just trying to feed stray cats. Chan said he hoped that the government would ensure that the ban was enforced effectively.,Polictics News
Hong Kong will hold more international events following the Rugby Sevens tournament. the city leader has pledged. while one of his top advisers has suggested Covid-19 pandemic curbs may be further eased if infections do not spike after the weekend of festivities.Speaking at a forum on Friday. John Lee Ka-chiu lauded a recent high-level banking summit as a success. saying it showed the city had  returned to the centre of the world stage . while noting the Hong Kong Sevens was being held for the first time in three years. I am confident Hong Kong can organise yet another great world event.  he said.  Under permissible circumstances. the government could come up with targeted proposals to ensure Hong Kong s mega events and its economy can run smoothly. The city was becoming more  vibrant  as social-distancing curbs were gradually relaxed. he added.The rugby tournament. which runs Friday to Sunday. has been billed as a major event marking the reopening of Hong Kong. alongside FinTech week and the recently concluded Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit.The city has been slowly easing its pandemic control measures over the past few months. but public gatherings of more than 12 people remain banned. while the movement of inbound travellers is restricted during the three days of their arrival.Hong Kong Sevens 2022: day 1. as it happenedAt the stadium in Causeway Bay. a group of fans who had flown from South Africa told the Post they were caught off guard by the three-day rule. They would only be able to watch the matches in person on the final day. they said.For the first time in a while. fans are allowed to eat and drink inside the stadium although capacity has been limited to 35.000. Lee is expected to watch the finals alongside the fans. the Post has learned.Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee. convenor of Lee s key decision-making body. the Executive Council. likened the weekend rugby showdown to a  test  for the city. If we can make it through the test of the Hong Kong Sevens. with 26.000 people partying in the stadium for three days and then heading to bars later. I believe we would have what it takes to further relax measures if we don t see a drastic uptick in the number of cases.  she told the forum.But Ip. also a lawmaker. did not say which social-distancing measures could be relaxed next.Hong Kong on Friday recorded 4.516 Covid-19 infections. 356 of which were imported. and 11 additional deaths. The city s tally stands at 1.937.596 cases and 10.439 fatalities.While Lee lauded the Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit as a success. it was not without a hiccup.Hong Kong eateries. pubs can now stay open all night. but step comes ‘too late Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po s attendance this week at the three-day banking summit despite coming down with Covid-19 last Thursday while on a work trip to the Middle East sparked accusations from critics of preferential treatment.Chan returned on Tuesday for the summit after obtaining a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result before his flight. but health authorities later revealed he had tested positive through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening on arrival and was regarded as a recovered case. His CT value. an indicator of a patient s viral load. was not disclosed.Separately. University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said it was time for authorities to consider dropping PCR tests for arrivals who had been infected but recovered from Covid-19 within three months of their flight. and registered negative results on RATs. From the start of this year. isolation orders can be dropped if infected residents test negative via RAT on day six and seven of their infection.  he said.  The same principle should apply to arrivals as there is no difference between being infected locally or overseas.Hong Kong Sevens to boost takings for stadium food vendors and restaurantsAfter nearly three years of social-distancing curbs. the government on Thursday permitted eateries and pubs to set their own hours. lifting a ban on operating beyond midnight and 2am respectively.That wave of relaxations came alongside news that guests would be allowed to remove masks for photos at events. catering and sports premises. as well as entertainment and religious venues.While public barbecue sites have also reopened. camping grounds are still closed. with a social-distancing ban barring public gatherings of more than 12 people.,Polictics News
A Beijing loyalist politician on Thursday appealed to Hong Kong s business sector to help promote the city to the rest of the world because it would be far more  convincing  than government efforts.Bernard Chan. the former convenor of the key decision-making body the Executive Council. told a panel discussion at the inaugural Hong Kong-Asean Summit. organised by the Post. that the government needed assistance from the private sector.He was speaking after he was asked how Hong Kong could best rebuild its image in the wake of critical reports about the city in the international media. I don t think you can count on the government to be the one helping to bring us back to the world.  he said.  It will be entirely up to the business sector because we are going to be far more convincing with our counterparts. Chan added that the city should not compare itself unfavourably to rival Singapore.Chan highlighted that some Singaporeans would rather live in Hong Kong. although there were those in Hong Kong that envied Singapore s almost complete relaxation of anti-coronavirus measures. We were sitting here for at least one year. and … we want to be in Singapore because everything is so much better  Chan said. In the meantime. when I talk to my Singaporean friends. my wife s family. everybody. they said ‘are you guys kidding? We all want to be in Hong Kong . Hong Kong to enter one of world s largest free-trade pacts in Asean partnershipChan. also a deputy to the National People s Congress. the country s parliament. and other panellists said that. although some in the city regarded Singapore as a regional rival. Hong Kong had unique strengths in areas ranging from its closeness to mainland China. to the city s distinctive culture and cuisine.The panellists suggested there was scope for Hong Kong and Singapore. as well as the entire region. to work together on areas such as trade and technology.The Hong Kong government has gone all out in the last week to highlight that the city was  back to business  as a series of high-profile international events were held to signal a return to normality after the social unrest of 2019 and nearly three years of tough Covid-19 restrictions.Other speakers on the panel – themed on  How can Hong Kong attract Chinese and Asean talents and strengthen its unique positioning?  – included Victor Fung Kwok-king. the group chairman of the Fung Group; Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong Hak-keung and K.K. Chua. an executive committee member of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong).Chua. a Singaporean businessman. backed the view the two cities had different strengths. He said that from its financial industry to its cuisine. Hong Kong possessed traits that allowed it to outperform Singapore. Singapore s knows that it cannot compete with Hong Kong s capital market. so it went for private wealth and it succeeded.  he said. The other thing is that … Hong Kong will always win over Singapore. because of one thing. You know what that is? Singapore doesn t have siu ngor.  Chua joked in a Cantonese reference to the city s roast goose dish.Fung agreed that Hong Kong and Singapore. as well as the entire Southeast Asian economy. needed to be  acting as a region . I think this idea of us against Singapore is a false dichotomy … Asia is so varied and diverse. I don t think there s any one point in Asia where you can tackle all of Asia.  he said.Fung said Hong Kong was ideally placed for the northern part of Asia and Singapore could be the hub for Asean and the southern area.He explained the two cities could work together as a dual hub  to raise Asia to the rest of the world .Hong Kong and Singapore battle to lure fintech leaders to competing mega eventsWong added that Hong Kong ought to be attractive to talent because. unlike some Southeast Asian economies. the Hong Kong government had been more hands-off on business development.But Chan argued a laissez faire approach was not always the best. and suggested it should be modified. Times have changed … the government should not be telling us how to run businesses and how to do things. but they need to help to facilitate.  he said.Chan also highlighted that the Hong Kong authorities only started to exploit opportunities in Southeast Asia after the mainland Chinese government forged closer links with Asean member states.,Polictics News
Hong Kong remains a critical partner to Asean as the regional grouping seeks opportunities in the Greater Bay Area and the city will provide  enormous value  to an Asia-Pacific trade pact it will soon join. city leader John Lee Ka-chiu has said.Declaring the city was  onstage again  at the inaugural Hong Kong-Asean Summit organised by the Post on Thursday. Lee revealed the city was set to gain early admission to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). the world s largest free-trade deal. with the support of all 10 Asean members. We have been living in the eye of a pandemic for nearly three years now … But what I can tell you. loud and clear. is that Hong Kong is onstage again. We have our doors open.  he told the forum in his 20-minute keynote speech.The city would help Southeast Asian countries secure far-reaching opportunities offered by the fast-growing Greater Bay Area. he pledged. noting members could take advantage of many of the government s new initiatives. such as schemes to attract talent and companies.The forum. centred on the question of how the financial hub could build stronger ties with mainland China and Asean. drew senior government officials including Singaporean Minister of Health Ong Ye Kung and Philippine trade secretary Alfredo Pascual. as well as hundreds of other policymakers and entrepreneurs.Hong Kong.  blessed with advantages . not only had the backing of the rest of the nation as a critical player in the bay area. but also served as an important partner to the Asean community. the city leader told the audience.He would chair a steering group focused on better integrating Hong Kong into national development and formulate plans to boost the movement of people. goods. capital and information through the city. he saidAuthorities would soon launch a pilot project for the innovation and technology sector covering the flow of material. capital. data and people between Hong Kong and neighbouring Shenzhen. he vowed. The government would also upgrade boundary control points and begin studying how to build the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link. he added. Hong Kong. after all. has the experience and connections to help mainland companies and capital go out to the world. while attracting global enterprises and capital to the mainland.  Lee said.Beijing s Greater Bay Area vision calls for financial. technological and cultural integration as well as policy alignment across 11 southern Chinese cities.Hong Kong s role in the region would be further expanded through its early accession to RCEP. he told the forum. revealing that substantive discussions with member states were set to begin next year. nearly 10 months after the city asked to join the agreement.Asean has ‘no reason  to stop Hong Kong joining world s biggest free-trade pact We can add enormous value to RCEP. given our unmatched role as the business bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world. as well as our status as one of the world s leading financial centres. and China s major international financial centre.  he said.The RCEP connects 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 Asean members. All are major trading partners of Hong Kong and accounted for more than 70 per cent of its total merchandise trade last year. and about half of the city s trade in services and investments in 2020. Lee noted.The pact. which covers nearly a third of the world s population and about 30 per cent of the global gross domestic product. aims to eliminate as much as 90 per cent of tariffs on imports among signatories within 20 years.The city leader highlighted that Hong Kong and Asean had come a long way together. with the regional bloc being the city s second-largest trading partner since 2010. while merchandise trade between both sides exceeded US$160 billion (HK$1.26 trillion) last year. representing more than 12 per cent of the financial hub s total trade volume.DAB to focus on Indonesia. raise concerns over captive Hongkongers during Asean tourLee said he was confident that trade. investment ties and cooperation in general would only continue to expand. adding that the city welcomed talented young professionals from Asean member states. We re also keen to bring in companies that meet our strategic sector needs. And we re setting up a Co-Investment Fund of HK$30 billion. which translates to a whopping US$3.8 billion. to invest in their high-value business opportunities.  he said. We welcome Asean companies and talented professionals to join us in building the future. right here in Hong Kong. John Lee urges global banks to ‘get in front  as Hong Kong roars backCiting Canada s Fraser Institute which again ranked Hong Kong the world s freest economy. Lee said the city still embraced free trade and capitalism with the rule of law. guaranteeing a free flow of capital. people and information.He also touted the city s prowess as an international financial centre and a global trading. shipping and logistics economy. and its emerging role in innovation and technology.The location of the city was another strong advantage. he added. as Hong Kong could reach most major Asian cities within four hours  flight. and half of the world s population within five hours.Lee also noted that he would be travelling to Bangkok in two weeks  time for this year s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. It will be an invaluable opportunity for me to showcase to the world Hong Kong s resilience in the face of the pandemic. and our unwavering commitment to regional economic cooperation.  he said.  I can t wait to get started. to tell the good and true stories of Hong Kong. To tell the world that Hong Kong is onstage again. The city s participation in the RCEP was expected to serve as a  conduit  between Asean and the Greater Bay Area. according to Francis Ho. deputy-general of trade and industry at the Trade and Industry Department.Speaking at a summit panel. Ho noted the total value of goods routed through Hong Kong for the Asean and Chinese markets hit US$80 billion last year. despite the disruptions brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. After Hong Kong becomes a member of RCEP. products for the Asean and Chinese markets that go through the city can even undergo industrial processing with the reference of benefits stated in the trade agreement.  he said.  That means the positive impact on Hong Kong is bigger. In closing remarks. Yu Hongjun. former deputy minister of the Communist Party s International Department. said he believed that with Beijing s support. the socio-economic ties among the mainland. Hong Kong and Asean would increase. There will be great leaps in bilateral or trilateral … cooperation in various fields between mainland China. Hong Kong. and Asean.  he said.

Hong Kong will ramp up efforts to tackle  underlying security threats  by strengthening law enforcement and intelligence collection. as well as carry out  comprehensive  preparations for drafting a home-made national security law. the city s leader has said.Addressing a security forum on Wednesday. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said greater effort needed to be devoted to national security education even after the city had returned to stability and prosperity following the implementation of the Beijing-imposed national security law two years ago. There are still underlying national security threats from different fronts.  Lee said.  Dissemination of wrongful messages and slanderous accusations can still be seen at home and abroad. I must stress that attempts to glorify violence and weaken the rule of law have no place in any law-abiding city. Hong Kong is no exception. and we will do everything we can to ensure such actions do not tarnish our hard-earned restoration of law and order. At the forum. called  Towards a fairer and safer world . Lee pledged to enhance law enforcement and intelligence collection to build  a strong foundation  for security in the city. We will step up efforts in gathering and analysing intelligence related to national security and counterterrorism. in particular. online information and counter-spying intelligence.  he said.The administration would also undertake comprehensive work to fulfill its responsibilities under Article 23 of the Basic Law. the city s mini-constitution. he said. The article requires legislators pass a national security law prohibiting acts of treason. secession. sedition. subversion against the central government and theft of state secrets. as well as banning political organisations or bodies from establishing ties with overseas counterparts.The national security law that Beijing imposed in June 2020 following anti-government protests bans secession. subversion. terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Serious national security crimes ‘must carry minimum jail term  in Hong KongLee said departments would carry out thorough research to devise  pragmatic . forward-looking solutions to national security threats. Authorities would look into educating the very young on the correct understanding of the country and the existing national security law. he said. as such awareness would  greatly enhance Hong Kong people s resilience against instigation or incitement by people. organisations or countries with ulterior motives .Schools would also be encouraged to review their curricula and organise more national education activities. he told the forum. which was organised by Friday Culture. a company. and the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Coalition.Senior Beijing official says Hong Kong schools should emphasise national identityLee further pledged the government would  robustly react to wrong or misleading information  about the city s affairs and tell the  good stories of Hong Kong . Later this month. I will be travelling to Bangkok to attend the Apec Economic Leaders  Meeting.  he said.  I will surely be telling the world how good Hong Kong is and how Asia s world city is back on stage again. Loopholes in Hong Kong s system had been exploited by elements seeking to sabotage the  one country. two systems  governing principle. he argued. pointing to the Occupy movement in 2014. the Mong Kok riots in 2016 and the months-long anti-government protests in 2019. They threatened our country s sovereignty and security and defied the authorities of the central people s government and the Basic Law.  Lee said.Stability was only restored when the central government intervened and imposed the national security law. followed by its overhaul of the city s electoral system. he maintained.Justice secretary brushes off body s lower rule of law ranking for Hong KongUnder Beijing s changes. a vetting committee decides if candidates for the Legislative Council are sufficiently patriotic. a litmus test that members of the opposition camp claimed was aimed at sidelining dissenting voices.During a panel discussion. lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee. who also serves as convenor of the administration s key decision-making Executive Council. said the revamped Legco. now run by the pro-establishment camp. was more efficient than in the past. Describing the overhaul as a  democratic backslide  or  illiberal  was unfair. she added. I think it is simply wrong to divide the world into the so-called liberal and illiberal camps.  she said.  We have enacted many important legislations … we are making progress in producing more land and housing for the people. Ip also questioned why Britain introduced greater democracy in Legco only in the years leading up to the handover in 1997. arguing the political reforms had posed a challenge to the central government s authority over the city. And then we experimented with ‘democracy  for 25 years … And what happened? The legislature became dysfunctional. extremely chaotic and at times even violent. So the central government had to help us to reform our system.  she said.The central government s overhaul expanded the number of Legco seats from 70 to 90. while cutting the number of directly elected members from 35 to 20. The Election Committee. which votes for the chief executive and is heavily pro-Beijing. was put in charge of 40 seats. while the remaining 30 are decided by trade-based functional constituencies.Ip said the first step towards a fairer and safer world would involve Western countries allowing room for other nations to participate in global affairs. such as climate change. Whether it s China. India. Indonesia. or Egypt. to have a seat at the top table. to have the opportunity to take part in the making of rules. regulations. and standards.  she said. And I hope the Western media will cooperate by giving us a voice. to make sure that our voices are reported accurately. I won t ask for fairness. but accuracy is very important.,Polictics News
Hong Kong s finance minister Paul Chan Mo-po has denied receiving  special treatment  after attending a high-level summit despite testing positive for Covid-19 with a low viral load through PCR screening upon returning from a work trip to the Middle East.Health officials on Thursday also defended the arrangements. saying the practice of exempting asymptomatic patients with a low viral load from having to isolate had applied to all inbound travellers since mandatory hotel quarantine was lifted in late September. When we are looking at the cases. we have to consider the whole situation.  said Centre for Health Protection (CHP) controller Dr Edwin Tsui Lok-kin. while refusing to comment on individual cases.But authorities did not offer a specific range for the CT value. an indicator of a patient s viral load. to determine whether the individual had indeed recovered from an infection. The higher the figure. the lower the viral load. meaning the individual is less contagious. For people who have never been infected before. we are more worried. But for those who have been infected. we can see that their CT value follows an [upwards] trend. but the speed [at which it increases] is different for each person.  Tsui said.He added that for those who tested positive upon arrival in the city. authorities would look at information such as the test result. the date of infection and possible recovery. and symptoms to determine whether the person was re-positive. recovered or freshly infected.John Lee urges global banks to ‘get in front  as Hong Kong roars backChan attended a three-day Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit despite testing positive last Thursday during a work trip to the Middle East. sparking questions over whether he was treated differently from other inbound travellers who were infected.Earlier in the day. Chan denied he was treated differently. My situation was similar to many others. I enjoyed no special treatment.  he said.He added his viral load fell  within the range  of recovered patients when he arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday. similar to hundreds of Covid-19 patients in the past month who had not been issued  red codes  as they were also asymptomatic with relatively high CT values.But neither Chan nor health officials revealed his CT value upon arrival. Chan said:  Having taken my test results into account. CHP determined that I was recovered. and had no risks of infecting others. The finance chief was not wearing a mask while speaking to hundreds of financial heavyweights at a seminar held at the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in Central. and also while he delivered a keynote speech on Wednesday. Chan did not dine with guests as originally planned.In a statement on Wednesday evening. CHP confirmed that Chan had tested positive for the virus through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening upon arrival at the airport. but his CT value was within the range of recovered cases.According to health department records. from September 26 to November 1. a total of 455 inbound travellers. who declared a previous Covid-19 infection within three months before their arrival in Hong Kong. tested PCR-positive upon arrival and were asymptomatic with relatively high CT values. They were regarded as recovered cases and not contagious.Under the current policy. re-positive and recovered Covid-19 cases are not regarded as confirmed or imported infections. They are not subject to isolation and will not be assigned a red code on the risk-exposure  Leave Home Safe  app.From June 1 next year. inbound travellers who have been infected within three months of their departure date are allowed to board their flights as long as they present a negative RAT result within 24 hours before flying.‘Appropriate  plans for Hong Kong banker summit if needed after Chan Covid caseTsui from CHP also said such measures align with those that apply to residents in the city as they are also not required to conduct any compulsory testing in the three months after they have contracted the virus.Chan was wrapping up his six-day visit to the Middle East to source investment when he came down with the infection last Thursday.The financial secretary stayed in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. and was not allowed to board his flight home until his RAT result was negative. a requirement by the Hong Kong government that applied to all inbound travellers.Government health expert Professor David Hui Shu-cheong of Chinese University earlier said that as PCR tests were more sensitive than RAT. if a CT value exceeded 30. the individual was no longer considered infectious.Dr Leung Chi-chiu. a respiratory disease specialist. said it was likely that Chan s CT value was high. showing that he had a low viral load.He said the infection risk should be low and Chan s case was similar to patients who were freshly discharged from hospitals.Hong Kong on Thursday logged 5.245 coronavirus infections. including 416 imported ones. as well as 10 more related fatalities. The city s tally stands at 1.933.080 cases and 10.428 fatalities.,Polictics News

Hong Kong s justice minister has maintained that the city is still in a good place in terms of law and order and its ability to stamp out corruption despite sliding three spots in the latest global ranking for rule of law.Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok also brushed aside concerns over the city s human rights situation on Thursday. a day after the non-governmental World Justice Project ranked Hong Kong at 22nd. down from 19th last year.The independent body. with offices in America. Singapore and Mexico and with a mission to promote the rule of law. examined 140 jurisdictions for the report.Lam insisted the lowered score the city was given for human rights was because of biased perceptions. We all know what kind of attacks the outside world has been launching at Hong Kong.  Lam said on Thursday.The organisation gave Hong Kong a rating of 0.73. the lowest since it started to list the city in 2015. with 1 being the best. The city hovered around 0.76 to 0.77 in previous years. We can t just take a simplistic view. Is there a huge difference between the 19th and 22nd place when there are 140 jurisdictions involved?  Lam asked. We have a lot of rankings. like that of universities or restaurants. They go up and down a few spots every now and then. but it doesn t mean real changes. UN human rights watchdog urges Hong Kong to repeal national security lawLam. a qualified barrister. appealed to the public to look at the breakdown of the rankings and highlighted that the city was still 9th for  absence of corruption  and 6th for  order and security . They are an essential part of the rule of law and we are within the top 10.  he said.But Hong Kong scored just 0.58 on  constraints on government powers  this year. a drop compared to its highest score of 0.71 in 2015.The city s rating for fundamental rights dropped from 0.7 to 0.59 over the same period.A government spokesman said the city s 22nd position was  higher than some Western countries which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong . but did not single out any nations.Hong Kong was sandwiched between France in 21st place and Spain in 23rd in the rankings. with both getting the same 0.73 overall ratings.The city outpaced the United States. which notched up a score of 0.71. which placed it 26th in the league table.But Hong Kong trailed behind rival Singapore. which was 17th with a score of 0.78. a position unchanged from the last report.Lam also defended the government s latest decision to amend the law – rather than file an appeal – after a court ruled against the government s invalidation of 20.000 coronavirus jab exemptions.The ruling was the result of a judicial challenge over whether the government could dismiss the 20.000 certificates granted by seven doctors alleged to have issued false documents.Beijing hits back at US senators  remarks over conviction of Hong Kong s Jimmy LaiThe health authorities amended the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance on Tuesday. a move that sparked controversy over whether the government had shown respect for the judicial process.But Lam said the amendment should not be viewed as the government having little confidence in the court.He said several legal options were available and the government had opted for the one which put the public interest at the forefront. We had to be prompt and resolute. while the decision had to be determinative.  he said.Lam dismissed suggestions by some lawmakers that the government should have proceeded with the appeal and the legal amendments.He said that course would be a waste of judicial resources and that the matter would be too  academic  by then to justify the court s scrutiny.Lam also outlined a plan to promote the city as a legal centre of excellence. in line with Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu s policy address last week. and pledged to increase public understanding of the rule of law and constitutional order.He said his bureau would work with other departments. such as education and the home and youth affairs. to better inform the public on the nation s constitution and the Basic Law. the city s mini-constitution. as well as on the national security legislation and the principles of common law.Lam promised to forge closer links between the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese legal systems on civil law affairs. such as the service of legal documents and recognition of rulings.He said a team would be set up specialising in the Greater Bay Area. in line with Beijing s plan to turn Hong Kong and Macau into an innovation hub alongside nine mainland cities.The policy address also focused on Asean member states. southeast Asian.

Hong Kong health authorities  latest move to stop taking nasal swab samples for Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests may allow more imported cases to enter the community. but does not pose a risk to the local pandemic situation. medical experts have said.But respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu on Monday said he found it  problematic  for the city s government to opt for a less sensitive method when it had been spending a huge amount of resources on PCR testing.The government earlier announced that from Tuesday. only throat swab samples would be collected for free PCR tests at government-run sites. including those at the airport. to boost the efficiency and capacity of the services.Leung. a former chairman of the Hong Kong Medical Association s advisory committee on communicable diseases. said sensitivity could drop by one-third if only throat swabs were taken. but such a change might have  little effect  on the imported case situation.Overseas studies had shown that the sensitivity of using both samples was 97 per cent. but that of throat swabs only reached 68 per cent. he added. But at this stage. we are not too concerned about imported cases. No matter how much the [tests ] sensitivity decreases. many cases can be detected at the airport.  he told a radio programme on Monday. Even if the imported cases enter the community. it will only lead to a small-scale transmission compared with transmission within the community. The proportion of imported cases among overall infections is still less than 10 per cent. The authorities on Saturday said a throat swab was one of the specimens recommended by the National Health Commission and commonly used in mainland China for PCR tests.They added that the new arrangement had  reliable  sensitivity and could reduce the time for sample collection. as well as streamlining the collection procedure. The adjustment is conducive to enhancing the overall efficiency and boosting the capacity of testing services. while not affecting nucleic acid tests  accuracy.  a government spokesman said. adding that self-paid tests were not subject to the changes.But Leung said he could not understand why such changes were made. This is a bit problematic because the government is wasting a huge amount of resources [on PCR testing]. It also takes up much time for people to head to the testing stations. causing inconvenience.  he said. If you are conducting PCR testing. but using a less sensitive method. it is contradictory to the initial intention of public health. Leung said the amount of PCR testing could be reduced as Hong Kong was on the road to normality. adding that initiatives should be focused on protecting high-risk groups or monitoring areas with an increased prospect of transmission when the healthcare system was under pressure.He also suggested raising the threshold for compulsory testing. or replacing the PCR method with rapid antigen kits.The Health Bureau revealed earlier that from November 2020 to August this year about 37.3 million PCR tests were conducted at community centres. mobile specimen collection stations and during  restriction-testing declaration  operations. As of April. HK$5.8 billion (US$738.8 million) had been spent on this. it said.Tourism. elderly care sectors urge Hong Kong to further ease Covid rulesRicky Chiu Yin-to. an adjunct associate professor at Chinese University s school of biomedical sciences who also operates a medical diagnostics start-up that runs a few testing centres. said while forgoing nasal swabs might increase the risks of having imported cases being leaked into the community. the subsequent mandatory medical surveillance of arrivals could also detect infections.He said the new arrangement could reduce the sample collection time by two-thirds but the results would not be available any earlier.He said although the new arrangement might slightly reduce the tests  sensitivity. it was in line with the government s goal to provide ample. high-quality. speedy. accessible and affordable services.Currently. inbound travellers are required to undergo a PCR test on the first. third. fifth and seventh day of arrival as well as daily RAT tests.,Health News
A seasoned geriatrician and medical professor has been appointed as Hong Kong s first commissioner for primary healthcare as the sector undergoes the biggest reforms in a decade with a shift in focus from hospital to community care.Dr Pang Fei-chau. a clinical associate professor at the University of Hong Kong s faculty of medicine. took up the role on Monday weeks after Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced in his maiden policy address that the government would publish a primary healthcare blueprint.The blueprint aims to revamp the healthcare system from its current treatment-oriented. hospital-based structure to one that is prevention-focused and community-based. Additional resources will be invested to promote primary healthcare.A new healthcare authority with an independent budget will also be set up to ease the burden on the public sector and deliver the blueprint. a move medical industry veterans have described as the biggest reform in a decade. Dr Pang has extensive experience in public healthcare development and management.  a Health Bureau spokesman said on Monday. He will lead the Primary Healthcare Office to take forward primary healthcare development and implement relevant measures set out in the primary healthcare blueprint. including the establishment of the Primary Healthcare Authority and fostering the prevention and management of chronic diseases. New primary care authority mustn t be a ??oothless tiger . says Sophia ChanBefore joining the university. Pang was head of human resources at the Hospital Authority. providing strategic advice and leadership on workforce operations at more than 40 facilities.He is a specialist in geriatric medicine. president of the Hong Kong College of Community Medicine and a member of the Elderly Commission. a government advisory body.Primary healthcare is the first point of contact for individuals and professionals. focusing on health promotion. disease prevention and management. and supportive care. Successful primary healthcare ultimately reduces the burden on hospitals.Previous city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced a high-level steering committee on primary healthcare development and a pilot district health centre scheme in her first policy address in 2017.Hong Kong leader John Lee sets the most targets for Labour and Welfare BureauSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. providing a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration had also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint. but its publication was delayed. due partly to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.,Health News
Hong Kong should further review its Covid-19 pandemic policies to enable inbound travellers to visit museums and watch football matches. while elderly residents in care homes should be allowed to get some fresh air and join local outdoor tours. industry representatives have said.Players from the city s tourism and elderly care sectors ramped up calls for a further relaxation of rules on Saturday while authorities announced bookings for a new version of the BioNTech vaccine would open on Sunday for children aged six months to under five years old. with the jabs available at four centres citywide.Hong Kong has been implementing a  0+3  arrangement for overseas arrivals for more than a month ever since it abolished hotel quarantine measures in September. Inbound travellers are issued an amber health code under the vaccine pass. limiting their movement citywide during a three-day medical surveillance period.Hong Kong bar owners wonder if crowds of rugby Sevens fans will ever returnIn light of the current measures. lawmaker Perry Yiu Pak-leung. who represents the tourism sector. on Saturday painted a bleak picture for his constituency. telling a radio programme that the  0+3  model was too little. too late.Yiu called the existing amber health code  outdated . arguing that inbound travellers should be allowed to visit museums and watch football matches.  The amber health code is really unreasonable. Why are arrivals allowed to work or go to school but they can t visit museums?  he said.  If they are allowed to visit museums with their masks on. it should be quite safe. Yiu also urged the government to move to a  0+0  scheme as soon as possible. along with dropping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. which he called a turn-off for overseas travellers. If overseas travellers are still required to undergo three PCR tests. it would be difficult to attract them to come to Hong Kong. I think conducting daily antigen rapid tests during the period would suffice.  he said.The lawmaker said the tourism sector was still in trouble with close to 80 per cent of travel agents only recovering a tenth of business at pre-Covid levels. He estimated Hong Kong had lost HK$1 trillion (US$127.4 billion) in tourism dollars over the past three years. based on revenue of more than HK$300 billion generated by the sector in 2018.Tourists ??hould be allowed museum entry  during Hong Kong ??+3  surveillanceExecutive Council member Dr Lam Ching-choi. meanwhile. urged authorities to relax visiting and outing arrangements at elderly care homes. to increase communication between such residents and their families.Currently. visitors for elderly care centres need to be triple-jabbed and produce negative PCR results from tests conducted in the past 48 hours. Some care homes also set daily guest quotas.Residents in care homes. classified as one of the most vulnerable groups amid the pandemic. have generally been barred from going out. unless in emergencies or important situations. according to government guidelines. These elderly residents are physically and mentally fatigued from the past two years of not being able to go out. I have suggested to the Social Welfare Department to further relax policies and it has said it would consider the proposals.  the government adviser told the press after an event on Saturday.Lam added there should be fewer restrictions for visits at care homes. while such facilities could copy the model of local tours in which groups head out to country parks under  closed-loop  arrangements.In an earlier segment of the same radio programme that Yiu joined. government pandemic adviser Professor David Hui Shu-cheong echoed calls to further ease restrictions. saying the move could be made in two weeks if there was no infection spike from the ongoing rugby Sevens tournament. The chances of a sharp surge are not high.  Hui said. citing the city s overall vaccination rate and immunity in the population from waves of earlier infections.The tournament. which will run until Sunday. has been billed as a major event marking the reopening of Hong Kong. alongside the recently concluded FinTech Week and Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit.Hui said it might take two weeks to find out whether the city would come out on top following infection risks posed by the string of mega events this week. He noted the number of imported coronavirus cases had remained  stable  even with hotel quarantine measures dropped. adding:  There is more room for relaxation. Hong Kong on Saturday recorded 5.111 Covid-19 infections. 494 of which were imported. and 18 additional related deaths. The city s tally stands at 1.942.707 cases and 10.457 fatalities.On vaccination for toddlers. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan urged parents to be proactive in taking advantage of the newly available BioNTech formula.The arrival of the specially diluted vaccine was first unveiled by health officials on Thursday. with authorities saying on Saturday the shots would be offered at Hong Kong Children s Hospital in Kowloon and Gleneagles Hospital on Hong Kong Island.Parents hoping to inoculate their children in the New Territories can make bookings at CUHK Medical Centre in Sha Tin and Osman Ramju Sadick Memorial Sports Centre in Kwai Chung.Hong Kong eases Covid jab rules for primary. secondary full-day classes to resume Children have weaker resistance to diseases and can fall into severe conditions should they get infected with the Covid-19 virus. They may also develop medium- to long-term after-effects following recovery.  she warned.The latest German-produced BioNTech shot can be given to children aged six months to under five years and parents are advised to leave an eight-week gap between the first and second jabs. although this period can be shortened to three weeks subject to personal needs. The third dose should be administered at least three months after the second. according to the government.Currently. only the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine is available to children as young as six months.As of Saturday. 18.7 per cent of children under two years of age and 66.8 per cent of those between three and 11 years had received a first dose of the Sinovac vaccine. Another 20.3 per cent of those aged five to 11 years had received their first BioNTech shot.Meanwhile. the Hospital Authority adjusted to the back-to-work arrangement for staff identified as close contacts of a Covid-19 case. under which employees are expected to return to work the next day the earliest if they receive a negative result on a rapid antigen test and are asymptomatic and physically fit. It will take effect from November 9.A spokesman for the authority said it adjusted the measure due to a possible surge in demand for medical services as the city faced the winter flu season. After considering demand for medical staff during the pandemic and the influenza season. and balancing infectious risks. the Hospital Authority has decided to revise the relevant work arrangements.  it said.But staff should undergo PCR tests in the first six day of being identified as a close contact and they are required to wear respirators during work hours and eat alone. according to the authority.Additional reporting by William Yiu,Health News
Hong Kong residents who were born in 2009 or after should be banned from buying cigarettes by 2027. government advisers have proposed. as they recommended a basket of measures to further shrink the smoking population.The idea of creating a  smoke-free generation  by the end of the five-year term of the new administration was proposed by the Council on Smoking and Health on Thursday.It means that when this group of residents reach 18 years old in 2027 or later. they will not be allowed to buy tobacco products. It can help achieve the ??obacco endgame .  council chairman Henry Tong Sau-chai said.  We hope it can be achieved before the current government finishes its term. New Zealand has adopted the same approach. banning anyone born in 2008 or after from purchasing cigarettes.The city s smoking population dropped below double-digits last year for the first time since tracking began. hitting 9.5 per cent. but Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged in his maiden policy address last year to lower the rate to 7.8 per cent in three years.The Health Bureau is expected to unveil its plan for stronger tobacco controls for public consultation early next year.Other measures proposed by the statutory body included doubling the current tobacco tax by 2023-24. which means a pack of cigarettes currently priced at HK$60 would rise to around HK$100.Hong Kong may once again allow some types of e-cigarette re-exports It is the most effective way to achieve the government s key performance indicator.  the council s executive director Vienna Lai Wai-yin said.The council said the tax should be further raised in the following two years. so a pack of cigarettes would cost HK$200 eventually by 2025-26.Lai said he hoped the long-awaited tax increase would increase incentives for quitting smoking as the last time the government raised the tobacco tax by 11.8 per cent was in 2014.The council also recommended expanding the city s non-smoking areas to cover taxi and bus stands. as well as spaces that fall within 10 meters of hospitals. schools and community facilities.Hong Kong currently does not allow smoking on public transport. including its interchanges. in hospitals. schools. parks and indoor areas of restaurants. bars and malls.Regarding the Post s previous report about the government s consideration to reverse the ban on the re-export of e-cigarettes and other heated tobacco products as a means to boost the economy. Tong opposed the possible move.Malaysia redraws anti-smoking bill amid concerns over loss of rights It is against the intention of the legislation.  Tong said.  It will pass on bad values to children. Under the amended law which took effect in April. no one can import. sell or manufacture alternative smoking products such as electronic cigarettes. heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes.The legislation also prohibits smoking products from being transshipped through Hong Kong when brought in by truck or ship for transport onwards overseas. although air transshipment cargo and transit cargo that stays on a plane or ship are exempt.Tong worried that the reverse would create a  loophole  where alternative tobacco products would slip to the community.Lawmaker Shiu Ka-fai. representing the wholesale and retail sector. said poorer smokers would not be able to afford the product after the price rose. I agree with a reasonable tax increase by following the inflation rate. or else [the frozen tax] will sound like encouraging smoking. But if the increase deviates too much. it is a discrimination against the poor as the rich will not be affected.  Shiu said.He also opposed the idea of  smoke-free generation  as the policy would limit freedom of choice. It is true that the underage should not smoke cigarettes. but adults should have the freedom of choice instead of having the government make the decision for them.  he said.The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group. which is formed by smokers. said they opposed the tax hike as smokers might seek black-market cigarettes instead of quitting the habit. adding that it would impact the city s economic recovery.,Health News
An abnormal spate of melioidosis. a fatal infectious disease. in Hong Kong might have originated from the bacterium found in the soil on top of a reservoir in West Kowloon after a government investigation found the DNA profiles highly identical.Revealing the findings on Thursday. a top microbiologist leading the investigation said it was unknown how the bacterium had been passed on to the patients. stressing the city s fresh water supply was still safe. The tests conducted on water samples collected from the reservoir in Shek Kip Mei so far all tested negative.  Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong said.  All we know is that the DNA [of patients and soil samples] are almost the same. and the soil samples were collected on top of the reservoir. Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soil. especially moist clay. and muddy water. melioidosis is an infectious disease with symptoms including fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.A total of 34 melioidosis cases have been found in Hong Kong this year. considered as unusual compared with previous years. with 23 detected in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven patients have died of the disease.Health authorities found that the cases in Sham Shui Po district were in the proximity of the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs. and a construction site at Pak Tin Estate.Among the 471 environmental samples obtained from the area. 38 of them contained the bacterium. with 32 being collected from the soil on top of the reservoirs. Four of the soil samples from the reservoir were genetically similar to the samples collected from the patients in the district.Hong Kong melioidosis outbreak: what is causing it and how can you stay safe?Yuen said the team could not tell how it spread despite conducting multiple inspections. but he highlighted several possibilities: bacterium entering the reservoir through the air vents; increase in water temperature lowering the chlorine levels in fresh water; more elderly people living in the Sham Shui Po district; and global warming increasing the volume of Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil.Apart from an earlier suggestion to increase the chlorine levels in water. the expert team also recommended the government install air filters at the air vents and some ultraviolet lamps at the reservoir.The chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. were raised last week in a bid to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicThe public. especially the elderly. was also advised to let the taps run for at least a minute before use and to boil water before drinking it. The investigation has come to an end at this stage.  Yuen said.  We have to accept that the disease has become endemic ??the public need not be overly concerned if the cases do not share a common origin. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. of the Centre for Health Protection. said authorities were revising the laws to include melioidosis as a statutory notifiable disease. which meant doctors would have to report suspected or confirmed cases.Two cases of melioidosis were also reported at Eastern Hospital last month. Au said results of whole genome sequencing were different from the Sham Shui Po cluster. We believe that the two cases are not related to the Sham Shui Po cluster and are sporadic cases that are found locally from time to time.  he noted.Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen added that different genome sequencing results meant the cases did not have a common source of infection. therefore there was no cause for concern.Last week. 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin Estate who had chronic illnesses were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. Eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam said there might be multiple sources of infection including inhaling of contaminated soil or drinking of compromised water.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosis It is difficult to determine the actual transmission route. You can only raise suspicions as the samples collected around the reservoir [were positive].  he said.Lam warned that the residents living next to the reservoir who suffered from chronic illness. especially diabetes. should only use boiled water for drinking or brushing teeth.Respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu suggested the authorities testing the elderly or those with chronic illnesses in Pak Tin Estate check whether they had been exposed as well.,Health News
A top Hong Kong microbiologist has retracted seven research papers published between eight to 18 years ago after image errors were discovered. but he insisted the mistakes did not affect research conclusions and had nothing to do with his work on severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) or the Covid-19 pandemic.Yuen Kwok-yung. 66. a chair professor of infectious diseases at the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and who discovered Sars. told the Post on Wednesday he had made a  supervisory oversight .He expressed regret over the use of some images for the seven journal articles involved. for which he was the team leader. As the last corresponding author of these research papers. I did commit a mistake which was a supervisory oversight ??It s nobody s fault but mine.  he said. I regret what happened and have been doing everything possible to correct the scientific record according to the highest professional standards. Leading Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung gets Covid-19The microbiologist on August 1 decided to ask journal editors to retract the research papers the same day he got emails from an unknown party who alerted him about the similarity of some test strip images for Western Blot. a test to show whether some animals or humans had antibodies against a certain virus. bacteria or fungi.The articles for which Yuen was either the lead author or co-author involved antibody detection for a particular kind of virus. bacteria or fungi on animals or humans.They showed a compilation of images of the Western Blot test strips to indicate whether the subject had the relevant antibodies. Similar to the rapid antigen test for Covid-19. the test strip shows one line if the result is positive and no line if it is negative.One article was about the discovery of a novel bottlenose dolphin coronavirus. and another concerned the identification and genome analysis of three novel viruses in fruit bats from mainland China. After being alerted about the similarity of the images used. I immediately used a forensic image software to examine the images and I found some of them strikingly similar to the others.  Yuen said.  I believe some of the images had been mistakenly mixed up by my research team colleagues so I immediately called for the retraction of the research papers. The error in each paper might have been accidentally and unintentionally introduced by one of the co-authors 8 to 18 years ago.  he said.Yuen explained the errors were difficult to spot. except by image experts or specialist software. but at that time they did not have such advanced forensic image equipment to verify if the images had been reused.All the serum specimens and other samples had been discarded seven years after publication. so the experiments could not be repeated. he added. We have no choice but to retract these papers. despite the fact that the errors did not affect the main conclusions of the papers or management of patients.  Yuen said.Yuen emphasised that none of the papers were related to his mainstream research. such as the discovery of Sars. Covid-19 or Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).He said he had also informed HKU s faculty of medicine about the image errors and the retraction of the articles.Hong Kong health chief to weigh call for natural Covid immunity; 3.762 cases loggedYuen said the faculty had later carried out an investigation and decided he had made a  supervisory oversight . adding that. from now on. his team would screen all their publications with advanced image software.Yuen. who has published about 1.100 articles over 35 years. said he felt upset about the mistakes. but that he did not think they would affect his reputation. We used a period of six months to two years each for writing these retracted articles and. of course. I feel sad about the retraction.  he said. But nothing is more important than telling the truth. The most important thing is setting the scientific record straight. An HKU spokeswoman said the university had acknowledged a recent allegation that some images used in the seven papers were  more similar than expected . and it then set up an evaluation panel to review the cases in accordance with established procedures. After careful deliberation. the university has concluded that there was indeed some evidence of the alleged mistakes in handling images in the papers. The corresponding authors received an official reprimand for their mistakes in the respective research work.  she said.  The university will also be imposing sanctions on the responsible authors. The spokeswoman added HKU was committed to upholding the highest standards in research and integrity. All HKU researchers must be diligent and meticulous in their research endeavours and equip themselves with the best research practices to prevent similar incidents from happening again.  she said.,Health News
Hong Kong s former health secretary will lead a community care programme in which 1.000 nursing students will serve more than 10.000 elderly residents and educate them about online medical care services.The University of Hong Kong s school of nursing on Wednesday launched the pilot round of the Generations Connect Project under which more than 50 students will receive elderly care training and visit about 100 elderly residents living in Wah Fu Estate this month.Former secretary for health Sophia Chan Siu-chee. who now teaches at the university s school of nursing. is the director of the programme. In the midst of an ageing population. I think it is important that we have our students who are savvy in using digital health devices communicating with the elderly.  she said. And also in the midst of the Covid-19 [pandemic]. actually many elders have been stuck at home and do not go out. so therefore their psychosocial and physical well-being is being tarnished to a certain extent. So I think this programme is very timely in getting our students to communicate [with the elderly]. The project. sponsored by the Sino Group and Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation. will involve collaboration with 11 social welfare organisations in its second phase from January 2023 until the end of 2024.Almost one-third of Hong Kong elderly felt lonely during fifth Covid wave: surveyIn the second phase. more than 1.000 bachelor s and master s students at the school of nursing will work with 10.000 elderly residents in need across 18 districts in the city through regular home visits. phone calls and video conferences. in an effort to enhance their psychosocial and mental well-being. The project will also be integrated into various nursing courses.Students will teach such residents how to operate an online platform especially designed for the elderly to access health-related information. as well as how to use government e-health services. to increase their digital literacy.Chan said one of the project s aims was to promote primary healthcare. which focused on prevention measures and centred around the community. adding that some of the topics included encouraging the elderly to exercise. Under an ageing population ??our nursing students and society as a whole have to face the fact that many of our residents are elderly.  she said. adding that the project would help the elderly build health habits that would prevent them from developing conditions that might add to the burden on the healthcare system.The project will also focus on increasing such residents  knowledge on Covid-19 prevention and evidence-based interventions.Data will also be collected during the initiative and analysed by the university. which will then publish reports and recommendations for the planning of elderly care services and nurse training. We hope we can do a good job in data analysis for the sake of the development of elderly services. preventive measures in the community and primary healthcare.  she said. We also wish to provide new [elderly care] models so that under the drastic change of the healthcare system. nurses can be well-prepared. as well as offering them demonstration and guidance during professional training.,Health News
Hong Kong has been dealing with a mysterious spate of melioidosis cases since August. with a cluster emerging in the Sham Shui Po district.The Post takes a look at what health authorities have found out so far and what residents should do about it.1. What is melioidosis?Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soils. especially moist clay. and muddy water.It is usually spread through contact with contaminated soil or surface water. especially via skin abrasions and wounds. as well as inhaling contaminated dust or water droplets and drinking contaminated water. While person-to-person transmission is uncommon. it can happen through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected individual.Melioidosis can manifest as conditions such as a localised infection. pneumonia. meningoencephalitis and sepsis. which is an extreme response to infections where the immune system starts to attack healthy tissue. Depending on the location of infection. symptoms include fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.The incubation period commonly ranges from two to four weeks. The fatality rate is between 40 and 75 per cent. It can be treated with antibiotics. but there is no vaccine targeting the bacteria.People with underlying diseases including diabetes. lung disease. liver disease. renal disease. cancer. or immunosuppression are more likely to be infected. Workers in agricultural. laboratory and healthcare are also susceptible to exposure.??ietnamese time bomb  disease: US deaths linked to Walmart aromatherapy sprayThe disease is considered endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It can also affect animals such as sheep. goats and pigs.2. How is the disease affecting Hong Kong?An abnormal number of melioidosis cases. 34 so far. have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. with 23 found in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven deaths were reported.The city logged 17 cases last year. An average of 10 cases have been detected each year over the past five years. according to official statistics.According to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). between August and October. 20 people. of which 16 were aged 60 or above. living in 19 blocks across Sham Shui Po were infected. They have no contact history with each other. The buildings are all located within a 1km radius of the Lee Cheng Uk and Pak Tin estates.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicMost of the patients from the Kowloon cluster over the past three months were immunocompromised because of underlying diseases. according to the centre.Among the 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin estates who had chronic illnesses and were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria on Saturday.It was believed that they might have had an asymptomatic infection in the past after being exposed to soil or water contaminated with the bacterium.3. Have the authorities found the cause of the outbreak?On October 21. the CHP revealed that DNA traces of the bacterium were found in the four soil samples from the construction site at Pak Tin Estate. but it could not be reproduced in a laboratory because of its low bacterial load. None of the infected people known at the time had worked. entered or walked near the area.After finding positive swab samples obtained from a water pipe and the surface of a flowerpot at a patient s home in Sham Shui Po. health authorities last Tuesday inspected the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs in the district with University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung.Although no positive readings were reported during the inspection. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. CHP s principal medical and health officer. said one direction of the investigation was whether the patients had drunk or come into contact with contaminated water.Considering another possibility of the spread. Yuen s team had also brought some cheap face masks from the district to see if they were contaminated.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam previously said wind and rain might have brought the bacteria to the air. which was then breathed in by the patients.4. What did the government do to contain the spread?Health authorities announced a plan to make melioidosis a statutory notifiable disease. meaning doctors would be required to report cases to officials.The Water Supplies Department said last week it had increased chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak. It was also considering Yuen s suggestion of installing UV light to eliminate more bacteria.Hong Kong doctors may need to report melioidosis cases. 3 new patients confirmedCalcium hydroxide. which can be used as a disinfectant of the bacterium. was also added to the soil at the construction site at Pak Tin Estate to protect workers and those living nearby.5. Should we be worried?Respiratory disease specialist Dr Leung Chi-chiu said the chance of having a major outbreak was small as the disease was rarely transmitted from human to human.As 38 per cent of the workers tested were found to be infected. he believed that the contamination at the construction site was severe. adding that the 10 workers were unlikely to develop symptoms unless they were severely immunocompromised.He said it could not be ruled out that residents at the public housing estate were also heavily exposed. adding that the government should test high-risk residents to look at the infection rate.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosisCiting previous studies. infectious diseases expert Lam noted that only a small number of people who come in contact with the bacterium causing melioidosis will suffer an infection.He said most patients were usually older. and there was no need to panic for healthy people with a normal level of immunity as they would not catch the disease after contact with low levels of the bacteria.He said the best way for people to protect themselves was to boost their immune systems.6. How should we protect ourselves?Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam warned all residents. regardless of their medical condition. against using or consuming unboiled water found near soil that could be contaminated.He said the public should also avoid using such water for other purposes such as washing. rinsing mouths or brushing teeth.He added that patients with chronic illnesses. especially diabetes. should be  extra careful .Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen also suggested the elderly as well as those with chronic illnesses run the tap for a minute first before using the water to brush their teeth. shower or drink.According to the CHP. the public can also take precautions such as wearing gloves and boots during activities that could involve contact with soil or water. washing or showering after exposure to possibly contaminated water or soil. cleaning wounds as soon as possible. covering cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings and washing hands with liquid soap after handling soils.Additional reporting by Harvey Kong,Health News

Hong Kong s new primary care authority will avoid becoming a  toothless tiger  if it cuts red tape and empowers community nurses to do more for patients. former health chief Sophia Chan Siu-chee has said.Now a professor of nursing at the University of Hong Kong. she said officials aiming to transform the city s health landscape must also act to woo nurses and retain talent. Last year alone. 2.600 nurses quit the public sector.Chan welcomed Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu s recent announcement of major reforms in the public health sector. including the creation of a new independent authority for primary care. It can t be a toothless tiger. primary care reforms are what the city has long awaited.  she told the Post. in her first media interview since leaving office earlier this year.Stressing the need for more funding too. she said:  In the long term. primary care can improve public health and reduce the burden on hospitals. But sometimes. you must invest first before you can reap the rewards. During her tenure as secretary for food and health. Chan was an advocate for increasing primary healthcare in the community. focused on raising awareness about health issues. disease prevention and management. and supportive care that all help to reduce the burden on public hospitals.7 key takeaways from Hong Kong leader John Lee s first policy addressSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. offering a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint which Chan was involved with closely. but its publication was delayed partly by disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In his policy address on October 19. city leader Lee unveiled a raft of measures on primary care. the highlight being the creation of the new authority.Chan expected some teething problems. saying it could be hard to reshuffle existing primary care services. such as those for the elderly and women. and bring them under one roof at the authority.The changes would also affect many patients. especially the elderly who were used to going to a hospital to see a specialist. she said. For hospitals. transferring patients to community health centres involved extra paperwork.In promoting primary care. much would depend on whether staff at the community health services could show patients that they benefited from going there instead of to hospitals.Hong Kong s public hospitals to offer up to HK$6 million home loan to staff The burden on hospitals will remain the same if patients insist on queuing up there for various services.  Chan said.  So the local nurses have to act as health coaches and coordinators with power to send a patient back to a specialist if needed. Besides her academic duties at HKU. Chan also took on a new role advising university president Xiang Zhang on promoting community health and other priorities.Since leaving office. she has been spending time training and developing career paths to attract new talent to community nursing.She said community nurses needed different skills compared with those in hospitals. and had to communicate well as health coaches.Chan said she was pleased that Lee outlined plans to attract overseas-trained nurses. following on earlier reforms under her watch to woo foreign doctors. We have to break down barriers and obstacles and simplify entry procedures.  she said.Given the high attrition rate among nurses. she urged officials to look at allowing those trained overseas to work in Hong Kong without having to sit local exams and undergo internships.Hong Kong s scheme for foreign-trained doctors gets dozens of applicationsWith other plans such as a pilot scheme to subsidise residents being screened for chronic diseases. Chan said she understood the need for a  step-by-step  approach and guarding against the abuse of subsidies.Ultimately. however. she felt it was important to promote and entrench the shift to primary healthcare and emphasise the benefits for all. Even healthy people have risk factors they should be aware of. and the system should allow them to take control of their own health.  she said.,Health News
Hong Kong s health minister has moved to invalidate more than 20.000 coronavirus vaccination exemptions issued by seven doctors suspected of supplying fake certificates under new powers granted to him after the law was amended on Wednesday.A government spokesman said the medical certificates would officially become invalid from November 9. adding that the seven doctors could offer written representations to defend their cases before November 1.He also urged those who held invalidated certificates to consult doctors to ensure they either received inoculations or continued to enjoy the exemption. Anyone using a false instrument knowingly may contravene the Crimes Ordinance.  he warned. adding the maximum penalty upon conviction was 14 years  jail.  Members of the public are urged not to defy the law and not to use exemption certificates obtained through improper means. The announcement came hours after Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said that amending the law could ensure  sufficient legal basis  for the government to assume its duty in pandemic work.The government last week lost a legal battle on revoking the exemptions. with the High Court ruling the health secretary had no power to do so.Dismissing accusations the administration sought to override the judicial process. Lo said:  It s not whether the government wins or someone else wins. We have to make sure all citizens win in this battle against Covid. The legislative amendments that empower the health chief to void exemption certificates deemed to be problematic took effect on Wednesday under negative vetting ??meaning lawmakers vote on them after they have taken effect ??but authorities are facing a fresh round of legal challenges on wider Covid-19 policies.Hong Kong health chief will have power to nullify Covid exemptions from WednesdayFormer civil servant and serial litigant Kwok Cheuk-kin. who won a legal battle last week that prevented the government from invalidating the documents. told the Post he would lodge a wider judicial review on Thursday against the vaccine pass and Covid-19 risk-exposure  Leave Home Safe  app.Lo addressed lawmakers in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. a day after the government revealed it would not appeal against the court ruling but would instead amend the law to target the jab exemptions in question. The legislative [amendments] are to give sufficient legal basis for the government to assume our responsibilities in our anti-epidemic work.  Lo said in defence of the move.He was referring to amendments under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. which empowers authorities to make regulations  for the purposes of preventing. combating or alleviating the effects of the public health emergency and protecting public health .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeThe High Court ruled that the government did not have the legal power to cancel more than 20.000 medical certificates granted by doctors suspected of malpractice.Holders of the documents are exempted from the vaccine pass scheme requiring residents to have had three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter premises citywide such as restaurants or bars.Six doctors have been arrested on suspicion of issuing the exemptions without proper medical diagnosis. with a seventh practitioner still wanted by police.Retired civil servant Kwok Cheuk-kin meets the press after winning his legal challenge last week. Photo: Yik Yeung-manKwok on Wednesday said that if he won his potential legal challenge. society would no longer have to dwell on the issue  once and for all . I will challenge whether [vaccine pass policies] are necessary. Hongkongers can only access designated premises by using this app but people coming for the financial summit are not required to. This is against the Basic Law as residents are equal before the law.  he argued.He was referring to the Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit. set for between November 1 and 3. during which attendees can visit designated venues despite the need to observe three days of medical surveillance ??a wider discretion that ordinary inbound travellers are not entitled to.Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun. an associate professor and administrative law specialist at City University of Hong Kong. argued that the government should appeal against the ruling. So I think this case deserves to go all the way to the Court of Final Appeal. so that clearer rationales can be laid down.  she said. In cases involving significant public interest. the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal had often ruled differently. Lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen. chairman of the centrist Third Side party. agreed. saying that the latest move gave the impression that the government wanted to  circumvent the judiciary .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeAlex Lam Chi-yau. of the concern group Hong Kong Patients  Voices. separately told a radio programme on Wednesday morning that while he acknowledged the government s power to amend legislation. authorities failed to show respect for individual rights when they overturned the court ruling.Calling the government move a spectacle. he said the 20.000 residents affected by the cancellation of exemptions had been taken on  a roller-coaster ride .He added while some had managed to get hold of separate exemptions later. they were still required under Hospital Authority rules to have had at least one vaccine jab. which could expose them to risks.Lawmaker Doreen Kong Yuk-foon ??who previously said that there was lack of legal grounds for authorities to invalidate such a large number of certificates ??urged the government to be more forthcoming in explaining the rationale behind the amendment to the law.She also expressed surprise the government had extended the vaccine pass scheme until next year. saying the measure would affect the city s road back to normality.,Health News
The highly transmissible XBB could become the next dominant strain of Covid-19 in Hong Kong. but the population s level of hybrid immunity should stave off severe illnesses. health experts have said.The city has recorded 140 XBB infections since an overseas traveller became the first known carrier on October 10. but the number still pales beside other cases involving dominant strains in the city. such as BA.4 or BA.5. They accounted for 95.1 per cent of local cases over the past two weeks. compared with less than 0.1 per cent involving XBB. XBB could be the next dominant strain in Hong Kong.  said Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai. a top infectious disease expert at the University of Hong Kong.  Nevertheless. XBB is a recombinant of BA 2.75 and 2.10.1. Most people in Hong Kong have been infected with Omicron BA.2 or BA.5 before. plus [they have] a very high vaccination rate. Therefore. [they have] very high hybrid immunity. The immunity. coupled with a lack of evidence showing XBB was more virulent than other strains. had led Hung to believe the threat it posed to residents was minimal even if it became the dominant one due to its high transmissibility. Therefore. it will not be a threat to the healthcare system in Hong Kong in the winter.  he said.But the potential of XBB to drive up infections had been demonstrated in Singapore. where the strain fuelled a surge to 60.000 cases for the week ending October 17. up from about 41.000 logged the week before. Authorities in the city state also said they expected the daily figure to peak at about 15.000 by mid-November.Singaporean officials said XBB was now the predominant subvariant circulating in the community. accounting for 54 per cent of local cases in the week to October 9. up from 22 per cent the previous week. The strain has popped up in at least 17 countries. including Australia. Japan and Denmark.In ??ost-Covid  Singapore. doctors warn against complacency as XBB cases surgeDr Gilman Siu Kit-hang. an associate professor at the department of health. technology and informatics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. said research on XBB had shown it was more capable of evading vaccine-derived protections than other known variants. but inoculation could stave off severe symptoms.The scholar also explained that while Hong Kong s recent fifth coronavirus wave was driven by the subvariant BA. 2. the early round of infections would provide  some immunity  against XBB.Hong Kong health officials renew push to sign up elderly for Covid jabsSiu added that the coronavirus was also likely to mutate. with more variants expected to emerge during the coming winter. This winter is the first winter since many places around the world returned to normal. Variants are expected to keep emerging.  he said.Dr Leung Chi-chiu. a respiratory disease specialist. said real-world evidence on the high transmissibility of the XBB strain was not yet available and cautioned against forming premature judgments regarding the subvariant. At this stage. the immune escape is based on laboratory experiments ??This does not necessarily mean they have an actual growth advantage in the real world.  he said. referring to the ability of a virus to evade detection by antibodies.  There is as yet no danger signals of the rapid spread of such a variant in our community. Hong Kong is finally axing hotel quarantine ??here s what you need to knowLeung also argued the emergence of strains such as XBB should not dissuade local authorities from fully reopening Hong Kong s borders and ending the three days of surveillance required under the government s  0+3  regime.,Health News
When Coco Chan became a mother in 2019. she felt like her life had been upended.Almost overnight. she went from being a busy public relations professional and business owner to feeling helpless and lost as she struggled to deal with the changes that motherhood brought.Not only did she have a new baby to look after. her body took months to heal from her emergency caesarean section. and she felt depressed and anxious.The physical. emotional and mental changes hit her all at once. It took a while before she found stability again. I ve dealt with many big changes in my life. but having my daughter. Harper. was one change that affected me the most.  says 37-year-old Chan. who lives in Hong Kong. Everything suddenly went topsy-turvy. My priorities shifted and I had to get used to a completely new schedule. I experienced major physical fatigue for the first time ever and felt disconnected from my body. I was depressed in my first month after giving birth. and my anxiety was at an all-time high because I put a lot of pressure on myself to be the perfect mother. I was also scared that I might never work full-time again. The coronavirus pandemic was declared not long after baby Harper was born. which only heightened Chan s stress and anxiety.Many times. she found herself crying behind locked doors or sitting frozen in front of her computer. feeling overwhelmed and unable to overcome the setbacks in a constantly unfolding situation.Any major change ¨C not just first-time parenthood ¨C can cause significant stress in our lives. especially if it pushes us out of our comfort zone and requires us to do things differently.In the last three years. the pandemic forced most of us to adjust to a host of sudden. drastic changes ¨C from upheavals in our personal and family relationships. to illness. the loss of loved ones. unemployment. the shift to virtual work. and so on.As we continue to deal with inevitable changes in this era of risk and instability. how can we make the process less painful? As human beings. we long for clarity and certainty.  says Lucy Liu. a life coach based in Taiwan and Los Angeles.  So when change comes along. we have trouble with it because it brings about feelings of uncertainty. triggering a fear of the unknown and making us feel anxious. or like we ve lost control. While we can t always control or predict change. Liu believes that we can determine how we interpret and respond to it. It s important to embrace the uncertainty and to make the choice to be positive. When faced with a change that seems scary and overwhelming. shift your thinking from that of ¡®I m doomed not knowing what s ahead  to ¡®This could be an opportunity for growth . Consciously adjusting our focus to a more positive one. or  positive reframing . can make a big difference to how we cope with change.According to American psychologist Martin Seligman. who is widely credited for starting the positive psychology movement in the 1990s. positive reframing isn t the same as being unrealistically or excessively optimistic.Instead. it means rethinking your situation and considering other. new or different ways to deal with what you re going through.Cultivating a more positive mindset can help us become more optimistic. which in turn may strengthen our ability to cope with setbacks.A 2014 study. published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences. found that optimists are more resilient and tend to bounce back from challenges more easily. When faced with a negative situation. they don t feel discouraged and are more likely to look for solutions to improve their lives.It s not uncommon to feel helpless when something happens that s beyond our control. Seligman says it s possible to turn this  learned helplessness  ¨C the belief that you don t have the power to make positive changes ¨C into  learned optimism .One way is to challenge negative self-talk and self-sabotaging. self-limiting beliefs. which only fuel pessimism.Instead. be mindful of what you say to yourself (and how you say it) when you experience setbacks and take note of how these statements influence your emotional well-being and your life.Replace these with statements that are positive. realistic. specific and empowering. and that give you a sense of hope and optimism. Our mindset can really make a difference in how we navigate change. so it s up to us to turn the situation into a more positive experience. one that helps us grow and thrive and that delivers a desirable outcome for us.  Liu says.As uncomfortable as change can make us feel sometimes. it s important to be kind to ourselves while we re dealing with it.Chan soon realised that she needed to prioritise her mental health and find a healthy balance between all areas of her life as she transitioned into her new role as a mother.Regular exercise and breathwork helped calm her and. instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. she made an effort to focus on the present. This helped me develop a more positive mindset. because constantly replaying memories of my own less-than-ideal childhood and obsessing over what kind of a mother I d be when my daughter got older only made me feel worse.  she says. Shifting my thoughts to the present and simply enjoying precious moments with my child reminded me of all the good that existed in my life. which made going with the changes a lot easier. Getting support can help you cope with the stress. Chan credits her husband. Dan Lun. for pulling her out of her  depressive hole . giving her backrubs when she was exhausted. and taking over the childcare duties so that she could sleep in. Her friends and sister also helped her when they could.,Health News
Abs. Abs. Abs. We are told to hold in our stomachs. Stand upright and suck in that belly. But this habit comes with health risks. experts warn.For decades. beauty standards have emphasised the importance of a flat. toned stomach and rock-hard abs. But on TikTok. people are warning about what happens when you grip your tummy too much. Hourglass syndrome . which now has more than 14 million views on the video sharing platform. is the result of sucking in your stomach for an extended period of time. Because you are contracting only your upper abs. the result is a muscular imbalance in your core. which causes the appearance of creasing or indentation.Despite its name. it is not a disease or an official medical diagnosis. It s a strategy for how you re using your muscles. You re gripping them in a particular pattern that creates this aesthetic of dimpling.  says Julie Wiebe. a clinical assistant professor of physical therapy at the University of Michigan in the United States.Over time. however. there can be physical health consequences. she and other experts warn. Hourglass syndrome  is the result of sucking in your stomach. which keeps your upper abdominal muscles tense and your lower abdomen weaker and underused. Physically. you may see it as creasing at the base of the lower ribs.The inspiration behind the name probably stems from societal pressures to be thinner. says Alexis Shoope. a physical therapist based in Houston. Texas. Think of how Barbies  bodies were made. Their stomachs go in a lot. then their hips would go out. That s what a lot of women think: ¡®Oh. if I suck in. I ll have that appearance . When you contract your abs for an extended time. it can create pressure on your pelvic structures. which may lead to incontinence or urine leakage during everyday activities such as laughing or coughing. The role of the abdomen is important in how you control your centre to stay balanced while we move around throughout the day. But because we have put such high value on abdominal work only. we ve messaged that you need really strong abs. and we ve done it in such an unbalanced way.  Wiebe says.Additional risks include stiff hips. neck and back pain and ineffective breathing If you grip your abdomen then try and take a deep breath. it s challenging.  Wiebe says. adding that deep inhalation is important for stress relief and pain response.  The diaphragm can t come down against the pressure that s been created in the core. The good news is that  hourglass syndrome  is typically reversible. Just as we have learned to grip our stomach muscles. we can also unlearn it. Awareness of the problem is the first step to stopping it. Most people have been sucking in their core for years. doing it throughout certain exercises or even if they re just sitting.  Shoope says.  We re not going to see a quick change. because it s going to take time. But the biggest thing is acknowledging it and learning some of the basics so you can figure out how to stop.Wiebe. who has more than two decades of experience in pelvic and abdominal health. recommends belly breathing exercises to retrain your brain and body to expand naturally.But more important. it is a mental challenge to combat problematic beauty standards requiring flat stomachs at the expense of our own health. We re told our stomachs should be hard and strong. The reality is they should be flexible and dynamic.  Wiebe says.  We need to change those dangerous beauty standards.,Health News
When Tong Jun-wan moved to Hong Kong from New York in 2020. he chose to live in Tseng Lan Shue. a small village in Sai Kung in the New Territories.The rural environment was perfect for his active lifestyle ¨C and his dog Buchi. a Labrador retriever he had relocated from the United States. My village house is on section four of the Wilson Trail.  says Tong. referring to the 78km (48-mile) south-north footpath that runs through Hong Kong country parks.  There are streams for Buchi to run through ¡­ he loves jumping in the water with a frisbee. But in early September. Buchi. two. contracted leptospirosis. a bacterial disease that can cause serious damage to the kidneys and liver. In severe cases it can be fatal. The disease can also affect humans. There are more than 200 different strains of this bacteria. but only six to eight of them can infect dogs.  says Joshua Steinhaus. a specialist in internal medicine at Hong Kong s Veterinary Specialty Hospital.  The bacteria can infect many organs. including the kidneys. liver. spleen and brain.  he says.Usually spread by rat urine. leptospirosis is most commonly caught in Hong Kong during the summer rainy season. when dogs splash through tainted rivers. streams and puddles. or worse. drink from them. Infected dogs can also spread the disease through their urine.Steinhaus says. anecdotally. leptospirosis season was later this year ¨C it typically occurs in July and August.  This year it occurred late August to early September. Steinhaus is among many experts in the city advising owners to keep dogs on a leash around watercourses to prevent them from playing in or drinking potentially tainted water.Common symptoms. he says. include lethargy. fever. sore muscles. shivering. weakness. increased thirst and urination. vomiting and runny nose.Tong knew something was wrong with Buchi when he didn t want to play or eat.  Labs are food motivated. so it was odd when he didn t finish his dinner.  he says.  He was also lethargic and later in the night started vomiting. Buchi spent nine days in hospital. two of those on kidney dialysis. While leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics to kill the Leptospira bacteria. intensive medical treatment may be required if a dog develops kidney failure or liver dysfunction. He had an acute case and almost died.  says Tong. adding that the battle continues with weeks of outpatient care.  He s on five different pills and daily IV fluids.  It was also tough financially: Buchi s treatment cost HK$392.000 (US$50.000).Hong Kong dog trainer Adrienne Lee saw three of her four dogs ¨C G Dragon. a three-year -old Jack Russell Terrier and her two nine-year-old Malinois. Rocco and Canon ¨C infected. Sadly. Rocco died. I live on Clear Water Bay Road and twice a week would take my dogs to swim at the beach.  says Lee.  I have no idea where my dogs got leptospirosis. as they have been going to the same beach for years and I never take my dogs to play in the mountain streams ¡­ They only swim at the beach and after they swim. I always put them on a leash. All her dogs were vaccinated with LeptoVax 4. which helps protect against four different types of leptospirosis. Buchi was also vaccinated.While the vaccine boosts a dog s immune response during infection. it is possible for dogs who have received LeptoVax 4 to still contract the disease.  We ve seen new strains of leptospirosis in Hong Kong which routine vaccinations do not cover.  says Steinhaus.Lee now faces endless and expensive medical treatment.  Some organs may never 100 per cent recover.  she says. I really want to thank my vet Dr Victor Poon. Because of his good judgment. [my dogs were] given the appropriate medication in a timely manner. Hong Kong vet Victor Poon. who treated Lee s dogs. says leptospiral organisms prefer warm. moist. alkaline environments.  They are more likely to be found in stagnant or slow-moving water. Although they do not replicate outside the host. they can remain viable for months in optimal environments. According to the Hong Kong government s Centre for Health Protection (CHP). the last human death from leptospirosis in the city was that of a 72-year-old man in April. 2021.Most human infections occur through contact with urine from infected animals. primarily through skin abrasions. open wounds or mucous membranes. and occasionally through eating contaminated food or inhaling the bacteria.Human-to-human transfer is rare. The incubation period is usually between four and 19 days.The CHP says people infected with leptospirosis commonly present with a flu-like illness with high fever. headache. muscle pain. red eyes. sore throat and rash. In some cases. it can cause anaemia and affect the liver. kidneys. lungs and other organs.1. Have your dog vaccinated. There are two types of leptospirosis vaccinations available. One forms part of the annual DHPPiL combination vaccine that all dogs receive. and protects against two serovars (types) of Leptospira bacteria. It is ineffective as a preventive treatment against the other serovars of Leptospira found in Hong Kong.Upon receiving the vaccine. dogs will develop antibodies to the Leptospira bacteria. which will boost an immune response during infection. It is possible for dogs who have received LeptoVax 4 to still contract the disease. but they will have a better chance of fighting the infection than non-immunised dogs.2. Avoid contact with fresh water. soil and vegetation that might be contaminated with the urine of infected animals. especially rodents. Never touch a dead animal with bare hands or allow your dog to come into contact with it.3. Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil.4. Wear appropriate protective clothing and footwear when participating in recreational or work activities that might result in contact with contaminated soil or water.5. Wash your hands frequently.6. Do not allow your dog to drink from or play in natural water sources. Take bottled water on walks instead.7. Avoid swimming or wading in potentially contaminated water.8. Eliminate rodents and keep the community and home environment clean.,Health News
Researchers have provided more evidence that eating earlier in the day might be good for you ¨C and eating all of your meals within a 10-hour window could be healthier. too.The takeaway from this latest wave of research on eating is to eat breakfast and try to confine your meals closer to a 10-hour window.Why eat earlier? Participants who ate meals four hours later in the day were more hungry. burned calories at a slower rate and had body changes that promoted fat growth. according to a study from researchers at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston. Massachusetts in the United States.The research was published this week in the journal Cell Metabolism. In this study. we asked. ¡®Does the time that we eat matter when everything else is kept consistent? .  first author Nina Vujovic. a researcher in the hospital s division of sleep and circadian disorders. wrote on the hospital s website. And we found that eating four hours later makes a significant difference for our hunger levels. the way we burn calories after we eat. and the way we store fat. Researchers had 16 overweight patients eat the same exact meals on two schedules: one with meals earlier in the day and the other with meals about four hours later in the day. For example. a participant in the early group might eat at about 9am. 1pm and 5pm; the other group at 1pm. 5pm and 9pm.Participants logged their hunger and appetite. Researchers gathered blood samples. body temperature and energy expenditure levels. and body fat tissue samples from some subjects.Late eating more than doubled the likelihood of being hungry. researchers said. When study participants ate later in the day. they had lower levels of the hormone leptin. which is present when we feel full. researchers said.Genetic tests also linked later eating with fat growth. and resulted in about 60 fewer calories being burned. the study says. We wanted to test the mechanisms that may explain why late eating increases obesity risk.  senior author Frank Scheer said.The study was small but was specifically designed to assess eating schedules  effects on the body. Researchers hope to expand on the findings. This study shows the impact of late versus early eating. Here. we isolated these effects by controlling for confounding variables like caloric intake. physical activity. sleep. and light exposure. but in real life. many of these factors may themselves be influenced by meal timing.  Scheer said. In larger-scale studies. where tight control of all these factors is not feasible. we must at least consider how other behavioural and environmental variables alter these biological pathways underlying obesity risk. If you try to eat earlier in the day. making breakfast your biggest daily meal may not be so important. suggests another study published last month.Researchers had 30 subjects who were overweight follow two four-week diets: one with 45 per cent of the day s calories in the morning. the other with 45 per cent of the day s calories at dinner.Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the University of Surrey in England had expected those who had a big breakfast and small dinner would burn more calories and lose more weight. Instead. they found no differences in subjects after they followed the two meal patterns.But those following the morning-loaded diet did report less hunger pains. We know that appetite control is important to achieve weight loss. and our study suggests that those consuming the most calories in the morning felt less hungry.  said one of the study s authors. Alexandra Johnstone. a nutrition professor at the University of Aberdeen s Rowett Institute.The two complementary and  rigorous  studies on overweight and obese healthy people  show how ¡®front-loading  calories is a beneficial strategy to reduce overall hunger . said Satchidananda Panda. a professor in the regulatory biology laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla. California.He was not involved in the front-loading food research studies but was among the authors of a study on time-restricted eating published this month.Your overall meal schedule ¨C and how close together meals are ¨C might be worth a look. that study suggests.That is because researchers found that firefighters who ate all of their meals within a 10-hour window significantly decreased levels of bad cholesterol. improved mental health and reduced alcohol intake by about three drinks a week.Subjects in the study who had elevated blood sugar and blood pressure levels saw significant improvements. too. they said.Researchers at the Salk Institute and the University of California. San Diego. tracked 137 firefighters who were encouraged to follow a Mediterranean diet and used an app to track their diet for three months. Half ate meals within a 10-hour window. the other half within a 14-hour window. Our study showed that shift workers with high blood pressure. blood sugar or cholesterol can benefit from a simple lifestyle intervention called time-restricted eating.  Panda said in a statement.  It s not a pill. but a healthy habit that can significantly reduce these three risks of disease without any adverse side effects. Participants picked any 10-hour window. with breakfast within two or more hours after waking and dinner three hours or more before going to bed on their off days. Panda said. Most chose 8am to 10am for breakfast; noon to 1pm for lunch; and 6pm to 8pm for dinner. he said. Putting all these together. it is safe to say that the general public can try to choose a 10-hour window that will fit with their lifestyle for at least five or six days a week.  Panda said.He suggests eating a bigger breakfast. preferably at home because it is typically healthier. then a small lunch ¨C  to reduce post-lunch dip . he said ¨C and a healthy dinner. If they choose a window that ends before 8pm. they are also likely to reduce their evening/nightly alcohol and dessert intake. There are some limitations. Those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. expecting mothers and people taking prescription medications should consult their physicians before starting any dietary changes. including time-restricted eating.  Panda said.,Health News
The global burden of osteoporosis has doubled in the last 30 years. while hip fractures. almost always a consequence of osteoporosis. are also expected to double over the next 30 years. according to two recent studies.Why? What s happening given our better advice on bone care as we age?It s partly because as we live longer. we exhibit more of the problems that manifest in old age. says Cheung Ching-Lung. associate professor at the University of Hong Kong s department of pharmacology and pharmacy.It s also party because osteoporosis ¨C commonly perceived as a woman s disease ¨C has been widely neglected in men by both physicians and patients themselves. Cheung adds.For men with hip fractures. roughly 20 per cent are treated for osteoporosis a year after hip fracture. compared with 30 per cent for women. Cheung says. This is also part of the reason why the projected increase in hip fractures by 2050 is higher in men than in women.Post-menopausal women are also prioritised for osteoporosis treatment over men on account of limited resources. Cheung adds.Hip fracture patients should be treated with anti-osteoporosis medications.According to Dr Edith Lau. a world expert in osteoporosis at the Hong Kong Centre for Clinical Research. one-third of menopausal women live with the condition. but so do 20 per cent of elderly men.Osteoporosis is a degenerative disease caused by a loss of bone density. It can be measured using a Dexa scan. which uses low-dose X-rays to check bone strength. Cheung helped me understand my own recent result.Bone density is measured at the spine and hip. Osteoporosis is diagnosed if either site has a T-score lower or equal to -2.5. If the T-score is between -2.5 and -1. this is classified as osteopenia. when your bones are weaker than normal. So. my -1.6 score indicates osteopenia. which may precede osteoporosis.Whether that happens depends on the cause of the condition and a patient s age. It can be stopped or reversed with lifestyle modifications.Osteoporosis is especially dangerous in age as it makes hip fractures far more likely when an elderly person falls. Cheung says. Osteoporotic hip fracture is known to be associated with increased immobility. morbidity and mortality. For example. more than half of the patients will have deterioration in mobility. approximately one-fourth of the patients will be institutionalised after hip fracture. and the one-year mortality in hip fracture patients is 17.3 per cent in Hong Kong. Loss of bone mass isn t just a risk factor for fractures ¨C it might also compromise heart health. says one study that found that thin. brittle bones presented as red flags for heart attacks and strokes in women.The reason for this is unclear. but research suggests it might be because weaker bones means stiffer arteries.Osteoporosis isn t inevitable: if one-third of post-menopausal women have it. two-thirds don t. So what causes it ¨C apart from declining oestrogen in the case of women?Being underweight is a risk factor. as is insufficient calcium and vitamin D. A drop in sex hormones affects men too. though. Cheung says. The age-related decline in testosterone predisposes them to osteoporosis.Common risk factors shared by both sexes include smoking. drinking. use of oral steroids and having other health problems.But there are ways to prevent it. Lau says.  Maintain calcium and vitamin D intake. make sure we do load-bearing exercises regularly. and maintain an ideal BMI [body mass index]. Load-bearing exercise sends signals to bones to keep up their metabolism. which keeps them strong. Walking is an excellent load-bearing exercise. as is dancing. jogging. stair climbing. playing ballgames and tai chi.The theme for this year s World Osteoporosis Day is  Step Up for Bone Health . which speaks to both action and awareness. Be aware of the risks. which include taking certain prescription medications and having some diseases. and know what you can do minimise them.Remaining active and on your feet is key ¨C 30 minutes a day if you can. And while swimming is wonderful for cardio and muscle strength. it s no good for bones.If we do nothing to change the incidence of hip fractures. the total direct medical cost in treating hip fractures will also double by 2050. Cheung says. In Hong Kong. the direct medical cost is approximately HKD$100.000 (US$12.700) per case already.Hip fracture patients usually need to stay in hospital for weeks. which brings further financial. physical and psychological costs. And a hip fracture often leads to another fracture. or imminent risk of one.How can we arrest. or even reverse. the situation if we have been diagnosed with a loss of bone strength?While adequate vitamin D and calcium are important. and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help protect women s bones in the face of declining oestrogen. simply using calcium and vitamin D supplements is not effective in preventing fractures. Cheung says. These are not drugs. The same applies to HRT. It can help improve bone mass but is not so effective in preventing fractures. That s where more potent bone-mass-building agents come into play if osteoporosis has been diagnosed. These include bisphosphonates. and the drugs denosumab. teriparatide and romosozumab.Not only can these stop further bone loss. they can even lead to significant bone gain. Most patients should have improved bone mass after taking these agents. so the condition can be reversed if treated and managed properly.Timely treatment and management are important. Cheung says. But anti-osteoporosis treatment is only indicated for those with diagnosed osteoporosis or with a high risk of fracture.In my case. I need to address my lifestyle to improve my bone mass and reduce further bone loss.1. Walk if you don t. run if you doWalking is good. Running is better if you re already a walker; the key is to put more weight on your frame than it s used to.Weight-bearing exercise strengthens bones in two ways: it prompts muscle to pull on the bone and it makes the bone react to high-impact force. Both of these actions encourage bone building.Studies have also found that maintaining bone marrow health keeps bones healthy. With age our bone marrow is inclined to turn to fat. rather like the rest of us. And fat has a negative impact on bone metabolism.2. Hop (skip and jump)Just five minutes of high-impact exercise a day could have a profoundly positive effect on bone health.In one study. subjects hopped on the same leg every day for six months. At the end of that time. scans revealed that bone density has improved in that leg and decreased in the non-hopping one.3. Add resistance if you cycle or swimIf your body weight is supported by a bike or water. you re going to miss out on the  weight-bearing  advantage of fast walking or running. You don t have to add weights to the mix; you could work against resistance bands.4. Look after your gut microbiomeThe microbiome is the new buzzword in good health ¨C that is. looking after our gut s health flora and fauna.Eating a gut-friendly. high-fibre diet is obviously good for all-round better health. but one study indicates that taking a probiotic supplement might be especially good for bone health.5. Get enough sleepGood sleep helps to build bones.While you re sleeping your body goes into repair mode. replenishing old cells with new ones and boosting your immune system. That means it is also building bone. so make sure you get enough shut-eye. at least seven hours a night.,Health News
It is difficult to know how many people in Hong Kong live with heart disease. which is the third most common cause of death in the city. accounting for 13 per cent of all deaths. Most cardiovascular disease patients don t know they have problems. or they live with symptoms without realising they are being limited by them.  says Hong Kong cardiologist Dr Adrian Cheong.It s just one of the reasons World Heart Day. which launched in 2000. is so important. It reminds us that cardiovascular diseases are ever present. worldwide. and that no boundaries are respected.  Cheong says. Despite the fact that amazing treatment advances have been made over the past three decades. there is much residual risk that needs to be reduced. People keep putting themselves at risk. he continues: according to 2021 data from the Hong Kong health department. 10 per cent of the total population smokes ¨C despite knowing the dangers of it.There are 630.000 smokers in Hong Kong aged 15 and above. And 56 per cent of men aged 15 to 84 are either overweight or obese. as are 44 per cent of women.There are key modifiable heart disease risk factors that you can control with lifestyle: poor diet. high blood pressure. high cholesterol and stress. and smoking and obesity.Cardiovascular health in Hong Kong is improving. says Dr Myles Chan. honorary clinical assistant professor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong s department of medicine and therapeutics.That is in part due to the Hong Kong government s efforts to curb smoking through education and by raising taxes on tobacco. The fewer smokers. the less heart disease there is. Chan says.He adds the number of heart operations. including minimally invasive procedures like angioplasties. and operations on heart valves and arrhythmia. has been steadily increasing in Hong Kong over the past 10 to 20 years due to greater awareness.Cheong describes how advances in cardiovascular treatments have improved the prognosis of those diagnosed with heart disease and points to congestive heart failure as one example.In the 1980s. the prognosis for someone in so-called  NYHA IV heart failure  ¨C when a patient is  unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. shows symptoms of heart failure at rest and has increasing discomfort if any physical activity is undertaken  ¨C was so poor that half of such patients were not expected to survive beyond six months.That. he says. is worse than some late-stage cancer types.  Nowadays. we are talking single-digit percentages for the same population.  he says.Cardiovascular medicine continues to improve. Cheong points out some exciting new devices to treat mechanical issues within the heart. including valve-replacement and repair approaches undergoing testing ¨C  especially for the mitral and tricuspid valves. whose job it is to move blood from the upper chambers of the heart [the atria] to the lower chambers [the ventricles] .Cheong also highlights several advances in prescription drugs. such as omecamtiv mecarbil for heart failure. mavacamten (trade name Camzyos) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickened heart muscle). and the repurposing of certain diabetic medicines as cardiac drugs. [These] are exciting developments that will help us keep patients out of hospital and allow them to spend more time at home enjoying life or contributing to society.  he says.Awareness is two-pronged: being aware of your heart health in the first place. and being aware that something can often be done if there is a problem.Chan. who chose cardiology as his speciality for its surgical aspect. says there have been significant advances in the past year. There is a new vaccine on the market for reducing cholesterol [a PCSK9 inhibitor called inclisiran]. which harnesses technology which can reduce LDL cholesterol [low density cholesterol ¨C the bad kind] as effectively as high-dose statins. but only needs to be given every six months.  Chan says.He elaborates on the role diabetic medicines might play:  There are drugs that were originally created for diabetes [SGLT2 inhibitors] which have shown enough clinical evidence to protect against cardiovascular disease. heart failure [and] kidney failure that they are now indicated for use in patients that don t even have diabetes. There s also a class of drug for diabetes called GLP-1 receptor agonists. which are not only useful at controlling diabetes. but have shown such remarkable efficacy at reducing body weight that they are now also marketed solely for the purpose of weight loss.  As for surgery. we have more evidence to support minimally invasive percutaneous approaches [via the skin through needle. for example] to heart-valve surgery [so] that hopefully soon fewer patients will require open-heart surgery. How can we best look after our hearts?Regular checks for cardiovascular health will vary depending on a number of factors. says Chan. He says we can t control a family history of heart disease. especially if it is early onset. as opposed to developing with age. And we can t control ageing. either. The things we can control include a sedentary lifestyle. smoking. obesity. a diet high in salt and fats. high blood pressure. cholesterol [and] Type-2 diabetes.  Chan says.  These all have implications on when or how early you should start having screening for heart disease. In general. he advises regular monitoring for risk factors for heart disease by the age of 40 ¨C that is. checking blood pressure. blood sugar levels and cholesterol. These are all simple tests.Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are another simple test. used to check the heart s rhythm and electrical activity. Sensors attached to the skin detect signals produced by your heart each time it beats. These are inexpensive to run and often form part of routine check-ups. says Chan.He recommends regular treadmill stress tests for those that are at low to intermediate risk and who do not exercise much. They can be useful for diagnosing coronary artery disease in some cases. and risk assessment in many.The one area of heart surgery that remains critical is heart transplant. explains Cheong. This is to replace recipients  hearts that have failed beyond salvage. Common causes include blocked arteries (atherosclerosis) or degeneration of the heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy). usually due to genetic or viral infective causes.There were only eight heart transplants performed in Hong Kong in 2021. says Chan. down from the peak of 17 in 2018 ¨C because of a lack of donors. If you want to donate your organs after death. be sure to register with the Centralised Organ Donation Register.This year s World Heart Day challenge asks people walk. run or cycle a heart-shaped route. Whatever distance you make.  the official World Heart Federation site says.  every step counts for your heart health .,Health News
Some parents worry about the negative impact video games could have on their children. but gaming may be associated with improved cognitive abilities. a new study found.Kids who play video games for three or more hours per day performed better on impulse control and memory tests than children who don t play games. according to research published in the journal JAMA Network Open.Researchers analysed brain scans from more than 2.000 school-age participants in the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States.The study has been the largest investigation into the association between video gaming. cognition and brain function. according to Bader Chaarani. assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont and lead author on the study.Playing video games has been linked to cognitive benefits in children.

Photo: University of VermontStudy lead author Bader Chaarani. Photo: University of VermontNora Volkow. director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse. said in a statement:  This study adds to our growing understanding of the associations between playing video games and brain development. Numerous studies have linked video gaming to behaviour and mental health problems. This study suggests that there may also be cognitive benefits associated with this popular pastime. which are worthy of further investigation. The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting video games may have positive impacts on players.Scientists separated children aged nine and 10 into two groups ¨C kids who don t play video games at all and kids who game for three of more hours per day. The group of young gamers. they found. showed more brain activity in frontal regions associated with more cognitively demanding tasks and less activity in areas related to vision.Researchers theorise the changes in brain activity could be due to the cognitively demanding nature of video games and an increased proficiency in visual processing as a result of gaming.Previous research has linked video games with increases in depression. violence and aggressive behaviour. but the latest study found no significant differences in mental and behavioural issues between young gamers and children who don t game. Excessive use of screen time is obviously not good for mental health and physical health.  Chaarani said.  However. in contradiction with other smaller studies. we are not seeing a direct link between their gaming and mental health or cognition. The authors emphasised that they can t say whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the gamers  performance and video games. Children who did well on the cognitive test. they said. may be the ones who choose to play video games in the first place.They also stressed that the findings do not mean children should spend an unlimited amount of time on gaming. The American Academy of paediatrics recommends a limit of one to two hours of video games per day.The study didn t include the genre of video games played in the analyses. Research. however. suggests that different games could have different impacts on the brain. Chaarani said. That s something we couldn t look at in our study because we don t have this information yet. but that s something we re going to be studying.  he said.The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. funded by the US National Institutes of Health. tracks 12.000 children who entered the study when they were nine and 10 years old through adolescence into young adulthood. We re planning to keep tracking these video gamers ¨C their neurodevelopment. their behaviour. their mental health.  Chaarani said.,Health News
The Covid-19 pandemic has affected many sectors around the world. disrupting people s lives in many ways.Media industries are no exception ¨C measures taken by governments and health authorities to battle the spread of the virus have included limiting people from going to cinemas. celebrities from travelling abroad for events and studios from filming.As such. the media has had to find new ways to work and to allow people to consume content.In South Korea. this has led to the rise of over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms and the use of technology for virtual content. This digital market grew from US$682 million in 2019 to US$832 million in 2020. Because of social distancing. many people stopped going out to places like movie theatres.  says media critic Jung Duk-hyun.  So OTT. which allows people to enjoy video content regardless of social distancing. has become a general. common way of media consumption. Do Joon-ho. a media communication professor at Sookmyung Women s University in Seoul. South Korea. notes the pandemic helped open up the digital landscape to older consumers who were once unfamiliar with streaming services. During Covid. middle-aged people and older generations got a chance to grow accustomed to OTT services. which shifted their consumption from IPTV [internet protocol television] or cable VOD [video on demand] services to streaming.  he says. For movies. cinema used to be the main source of consumption before Covid-19. but as the pandemic made it hard for people to go to the theatres. films made their releases on OTT platforms. changing the way people consume movies. The South Korean music industry. too. has had to grapple with travel and gathering restrictions during the pandemic. and has had to reinvent live performances and interactions between artists and their fans.In April 2020. K-pop agency SM Entertainment debuted an online platform. Beyond Live. calling it  the first paid online streaming concert service in the world .The service brings real-time performances to viewers and enables artists and fans to interact online.In December 2020. the state-run Korea Creative Content Agency launched Kocca Music Studio. which specialises in immersive online performances achieved with cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality. augmented reality and the metaverse.K-pop juggernauts like BTS and Blackpink have now held online concerts and fan events. interacting with their global fans via video chat.Lee Gyu-tag. a cultural studies professor at George Mason University Korea. says such online events have become the new norm in Korea s music industry. For artists who hold concerts frequently. arranging online and offline concerts together has become a new standard.  he says.  If it s a three-day concert. they do both streaming and in-person performances one day and hold in-person performances for the remaining two days. without being bound by time and space. As coronavirus restrictions ease. the South Korean media industry has been trying to return to the way things were done pre-Covid. K-pop artists have increased their global activities. distributors have started releasing delayed films and studios have resumed filming overseas.Experts disagree on which changes will stay. post-pandemic. and which will not. Although he is optimistic about streaming becoming a common way to enjoy performances. Lee doubts that immersive and online interactions will fulfil the needs of audiences. New technologies for immersive content like [the] metaverse used to be somewhat required as Covid-19 prevented in-person performances. So there were several attempts with the technology.  he says. Fans at first took interest but were not really in favour. There were a lot of fans who said those features distract them from enjoying the concert. Now that offline concerts are possible. fans feel seeing their favourite artists interacting with other fans through video chat is a waste of their experience. as they can go to the concert to see the artists  performance. Lee adds that the key to adopting new technology in K-pop will be about how well it can capture the artists  performances. New. cutting-edge technology is what fans want now. They want to have the same experience of watching the performances on-site. at home through a monitor or a TV. So it s not about fancy technology. but about how realistic the performances are as if they are actually sitting at the concert venue. OTT services. which enjoyed a rise in users during the pandemic. saw their numbers fall earlier this year after social distancing and travel restrictions were eased in South Korea.According to the big data platform Mobile Index. the number of mobile users of the top seven services in South Korea ¨C Wavve. Tving. Seezn. Coupang Play. Disney+. Netflix and Watcha ¨C totalled 26.86 million in April. down by about 3.4 million compared with January.Jung. however. says OTT services will still account for a huge part of how people consume media in the country. Since we ve already experienced subscription-based content consumption through OTT. we know how much content we can enjoy for a certain amount of money every month. So unless there s a film that is made only for movie theatres. we don t need to go there to enjoy media content.  he says.However. he added that the heated streaming market. filled with competitive players. would require the companies to take a different approach.,Entertainment News
After walking the Hollywood red carpet. Selena Gomez was the one guest who couldn t watch the world premiere of her own documentary. Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me.Gomez. 30. said she needed to step away once the deeply personal documentary started at the TCL Chinese Theatre to kick off the American Film Institute Film Festival. My Spanx hurt really bad. so I m a little uncomfortable.  Gomez said after the 95-minute film ended. earning a laugh with her deadpan deprecation.  I m also a little nervous. I didn t watch (the movie) with you guys because I think it would be too hard for me. My Mind and Me. (streaming on AppleTV+) follows Gomez through six years of her career. and provides a revealing behind-the-scenes look at the young star s challenges with her mental health. lupus and her all-encompassing fame.Gomez said she wanted to have Alek Keshishian. who worked with Gomez on the music video for  Can t Keep My Hands to Myself . direct her documentary since seeing his 1991 Madonna concert tour documentary Truth or Dare. The original plan was to cover Gomez s 2016 Revival tour. which was ultimately cancelled because of her physical and mental health crises. We soon realised that there was much more going on than just the tour that I eventually ended up cancelling.  says Gomez.  (Keshishian) came into my life in these moments that were beautiful. complicated and tragic. And I felt comfortable sharing what I was walking through. Keshishian called Gomez  so authentic and vulnerable . Unlike most pop stars and most celebrities I know. she doesn t have armour.  the Madonna confidant added of Gomez.The film shows Gomez growing up in Grand Prairie. Texas. and revisiting her hometown after superstardom to see her old school and neighbours. I m a Texas girl through and through. and I truly feel like the most beautiful woman when I m home.  Gomez said.  When I go home. I visit the house I m from every time and the neighbours. I don t think they see me any differently than who I was when I was younger. In My Mind and Me there are frequent flashbacks and discussions about Gomez s first role on Barney & Friends. a role that brought teasing at school. I got made fun of a lot for that.  Gomez said.  Don t go to the fourth grade and say that you star in Barney & Friends. Gomez said the film gives real and raw on-screen disclosures that might prompt important discussions. I m not gonna lie and say maybe there were a few moments that weren t scary to offer.  she said.  So I kind of used myself as a sacrifice in order for people to have the hard conversations. But I m also going to crawl into a hole for a few months after this. I gave too much. Gomez said she hopes the film starts  a chain reaction of people saying. ¡®Hey. I want to say something about my mental health. I want to talk about it and seek help.  That s one of the bravest things someone can do. If one person is just impacted by this film. I would consider myself the luckiest girl. When asked what kind of advice she would give to her fans seeking superstardom. the global superstar demurred. I d say. ¡®Oh. God. don t try that !  said Gomez.  I don t know who I am to give advice. I m not saying I have the answers at all or even a powerful speech. I would just say that people have given me a responsibility that I carry so deeply. All I would ever want anyone to know is that they re exactly enough the way they are. That they are worthy. They are seen. They deserve love.,Entertainment News
One of Hong Kong s most experimental and intellectual filmmakers. Clara Law Cheuk-yiu has always put art above commercial success.Films like Farewell China (1990) and A Floating Life (1996) took innovative approaches to depicting Chinese emigration. focusing on migrants  spiritual and emotional concerns rather than their economic difficulties.Temptation of a Monk (1993) made a Tang dynasty drama relevant to the concerns of the modern world. while The Goddess of 1967 (2000) showed a bold approach to the then-new digital filmmaking techniques. At long last a film and a director that Hong Kong can be proud of.  wrote the Post s Terry Boyce in a review of Farewell China in 1990.  Farewell China is one of the few local films I ve seen that can truly claim to be international [and it] restores one s faith that the local film industry is not totally dominated by the desire to make money. Law has an international background. which informs her filmmaking. She was born in Macau. grew up in Hong Kong. studied film in the UK. and now lives in Australia.Her first film. 1988 s The Other Half and The Other Half. was a romantic comedy. which. as Post critic Paul Fonoroff noted retrospectively. was one of the few films of the 1980s to address the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997.Law s other films include the teen comedy Fruit Punch (1991). which featured Leon Lai Ming and Hacken Lee. and a section of the portmanteau film Erotique (1994). which explored erotica from a female point of view.Law s latest film. Drifting Petals. which won her the best director prize at the 2021 Golden Horse Awards in Taipei. is a poetic drama that reflects on notions of family. history and politics.Over the years. Law has offered her thoughts to the Post in interviews about a variety of topics. Here are some extracts: I m not content to make a film from one angle. I don t intend to make a film that is just cause and effect. I want to tell a fuller and more complete story than that. My life is too precious to be wasted on things I don t like doing and making films takes a lot of energy. I don t want to be in the formula ¡­ I like to be walking this rope.  While I was studying in England and working in the US. I found that many of the Chinese immigrants were very unhappy. even though they were rich and had a lot materially. Later I learned about the tragedy in Japan. and I asked myself why Chinese people always have to leave our homeland.  The Chinese of our generation have a rough road before them. They don t have a country where they feel they belong. It s especially true for us Hongkongers. caught between being Hongkongers and Chinese. not knowing whether to be part of China or a second-rate citizen in a foreign country.  It s good to give yourself a break. Farewell China was too sad. and it was time to do a film that balanced it ¨C a film that people find comfortable and inspiring. What s most important to a film director is being able to do whatever they enjoy doing. and marketing considerations should always come second.  The period setting is just background. I m really using it to look at contemporary issues. There s been so much violence in the world in the last three years ¨C killings. wars. the break-up of countries. The era that the film takes place in is very similar to now. I want people to apply the story to the present.  This is the first time that four women directors are doing this and doing it honestly. I think it is at least something we can discuss. It may not be a feminist film. but it is certainly from a woman s point of view. It is a very good idea. especially as erotica is always looked at from a man s point of view.  I think I m probably more at ease with having the two cultures within me nowadays. Now I am living in Australia. I have found a home. I feel comfortable to take what I already have ¨C my heritage. which is the Chinese part of me ¨C wherever I go. I ve discovered that the world I hoped for. the ¡®Chinese world . is non-existent anyway. So it doesn t matter where I am. 	 Asian immigrants from Singapore. Malaysia and Hong Kong are not poor. But although these immigrants are quite well off. they still have problems. The film is not talking about economic survival. It s about spiritual and mental survival. Everybody has to go through this. rich and poor. After a while. you have to face the problem of finding a place. an acceptable state of existence. in the new country.  I think that the Australian landscape is quite daunting for a filmmaker. And the sky is amazing ¨C I m totally obsessed by it. I found it scary ¨C the landscape so vast and inhospitable. My first impression was that it was very hostile. without any feeling for the people who inhabited it. In this regular feature series on the best of Hong Kong cinema. we examine the legacy of classic films. re-evaluate the careers of its greatest stars. and revisit some of the lesser-known aspects of the beloved industry.,Entertainment News

In 2004. Bob Dylan released an autobiography of sorts. Chronicles: Volume One methodically charted the singer s life. but then took enough factual detours to make the whole thing suspect.Now we have a new Dylan book. The Philosophy of Modern Song. An argument can be made that this is actually his autobiography.Twelve years in the making. the new book is largely an impassioned valentine to dozens of the great songwriters and singers he most admired.They range from Hank Williams. Little Richard and Allen Toussaint to Uncle Dave Macon. Roy Orbison and The Clash s Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. but almost no women. And they include such timeless songwriting teams as Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. and Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman.Through this enigmatic. flattering and insightful collection of essays dissecting what Dylan considers the recorded era s greatest songs. we inch closer to understanding a towering. vexing. soulful and revered artist ¨C born Robert Zimmerman and raised in Hibbing. Minnesota.We sprinkle a few gems from Modern Song below. revealing just who garners the king s nod (the list ranges from The Who to Marty Robbins. from Johnny Cash to The Clash). Little of it is linear. Some of it is confusing. All of it is riveting. But let s start with why it s important.Dylan is 81. He s been famous for about 60 of those chameleon-like years. A protest-song singer who protested that mantle. A religious convert who converted back. A 1960s icon who reinvented himself in the  70s.  80s.  90s and so on. He s as easily pinned down as the wind.So if there is any true clue as to the source of his magic. it is not found in any biography but rather in the songs he revered. He said so himself. These songs didn t come out of thin air. I didn t just make them up out of whole cloth.  he told a rapt MusicCares audience in 2015.  It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music. traditional rock  n  roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music. I sang a lot of ¡®come all you  songs. There s plenty of them. There s way too many to be counted. If you sung all these ¡®come all ye  songs all the time. you d be writing. ¡®Come gather  round people where ever you roam. admit that the waters around you have grown/Accept that soon you ll be drenched to the bone .  (The opening to his anthemic 1964 classic.  The Times They Are A-Changing .) It s always about the songs. Pump It Up . released in 1978. helped put Elvis Costello and the Attractions on the map. It bobbed and weaved. Dylan was paying attention to both the craftsman and his creation. and offers his own take on the song s intended audience. It s not like you have a promising future.  Dylan writes.  You re the alienated hero who s been taken for a ride by a quick-witted little hellcat. the hot-blooded sex-starved wench that you depended on so much. who failed you. Of Costello ¨C one of just a handful of artists he opines about directly in essays covering more than 60 disparate tunes ¨C he writes that he and his band were  better than any of their contemporaries. Light years better. He also finds time to compliment Costello s suit-and-tie look:  The Brits. if nothing else. had dignity and pride and they didn t dress like bums. Money or no money.  A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-boom. Little Richard was speaking in tongues across the airwaves long before anybody knew what was happening.  writes Dylan in his reverential take on that seminal 1955 single.  Tutti Frutti .Dylan particularly admires the sly way the singer made a nod to homosexuality at a time when doing so was unthinkable. He was  the master of the double entendre. ¡­ Did you ever see Elvis singing ¡®Tutti Frutti  on Ed Sullivan? Does he know what he s singing about? Does Ed Sullivan know? For Dylan. the singer was at rock s ground zero. Richard s smiling face. just one of many compelling images lacing the pages. adorns the cover of Dylan s book. Little Richard was anything but little.  he writes.  He s saying that something is happening. The world s gonna fall apart. He s a preacher. ¡®Tutti Frutti  is sounding the alarm. Dylan famously toured with the Grateful Dead in 1987. On the surface. strange bedfellows. Looking closer. not so much. Winding lyrics. solid rhythmic backbeat. a disinterest in being hemmed in. Truckin  is off the Dead s 1970 album American Beauty. and that now iconic song hits all the right notes for Dylan. who hails its stream-of-consciousness. drug-fuelled rap by repeating back many of its lyrics. This song is medium tempo. but it seems to just keep picking up speed.  he writes.  It s got a fantastic first verse. which doesn t let up or fizzle out. and every verse that follows could actually be a first verse. That s the wind-up. now the delivery:  Arrows of neon. flashing marquees. Dallas and a soft machine. Sweet Jane. vitamin C. Bourbon Street. bowling pins. hotel windows. and the classic line ¡®What a long. strange trip it s been.  Many times in Modern Songs. Dylan uses a song title just to riff on something that piques him.For example. the coda to his essay on Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes   If You Don t Know Me By Now  (1972) is about religion (Dylan briefly was a born-again Christian in the late  70s). And the chapter on Johnnie Taylor s 1973 release.  Cheaper to Keep Her . is a rant about the billion-dollar divorce industry.So it s little surprise that Dylan leverages his essay on  War . the indelible Vietnam-era classic by Edwin Starr. to wax philosophical on war. something he did lyrically on early hits such as  Masters of War . As is his wont. he sees the paradoxes. Wars have raised people. freed them from oppression and actual slavery.  he writes.  Wars have reopened trade routes and channels of communication. And as history is written by the winners. so it is with war ¡­ You have to look to the losers to find the atrocities.  Viva Las Vegas  was released in 1964 and written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shulman. Dylan s entire book is dedicated to Pomus ¨C a larger-than-life original who also penned  Save the Last Dance for Me . This is a song about faith. The kind of faith where you step under a shower spigot in the middle of the desert and fully believe water will come out.  he writes. loping into a section about Elvis and his triumphs and fall in that unbending Nevada town.It s an alternate take on the glossy original. A meditation on the city s seductive if tragic lure. a place that demands  an atomic powered inner spirit  even though all the players know what happens next. Today. Elvis is gone. the Colonel [Tom Parker] is gone. Doc Pomus is gone. B.B. [King] and Dr John are gone. Meanwhile. Hilton now owns 31 hotels in Las Vegas. You can almost hear the sneer.  The house always wins. Viva Las Vegas.,Entertainment News
When Southern Afternoon. a short film directed by Chinese filmmaker Lan Tian. was awarded the Sonje Award at the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea on October 14. many thought China s short-film industry had already had a good finish to the year.And then three days later. another Chinese short film. I Have No Legs. And I Must Run. by Li Yue. won the Short Film Award at the London Film Festival.It would appear that short films from China have been rushing to be crowned in recent times. The prizes for Lan and Li s works follow several others that have made a name for themselves.The highlight came earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival. where three Chinese short films were recognised.The Water Murmurs. directed by Chen Jianying. won the Short Film Palme d Or ¨C the festival s highest prize for short films. Will You Look At Me. by Huang Shuli. received the first Queer Palm ¨C awarded for brilliance in LGBT+-relevant films ¨C given to China. Somewhere. by Li Jiahe. took second prize in La Cinef. a category for short films from film schools around the world.Meanwhile. three short films by mainland Chinese directors are set to compete at the upcoming Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan ¨C despite Beijing s continued boycott of the event.The notable success of short films made by Chinese filmmakers is in stark contrast to the subdued state of the country s feature-film making. which by all counts is having a particularly quiet time on the international stage. The achievements of Chinese short films are indeed quite noteworthy in these years.  Vivi Fan. a professor at Communication University of China ¨C a Beijing institution focused on education in broadcasting and communications ¨C tells the Post. Through short films. young Chinese filmmakers are showing the world audience and critics the new flame in Chinese cinema. According to Fan. who is also an adviser to the Busan International Film Festival. the strength of Chinese short-film creation stems from the freedom that young directors have to express themselves. [Short film production] is not restricted by the investors. in terms of [films ] length. genre. audience. and ideology. So we can see that our young creators are very strong in expressing what they think. Lei Shan. a film professor in Beijing and adviser to the Cannes Film Festival. points out that the huge number of film students in China is an advantage at the festivals. The number of students studying film in China is very large. [The film schools] would analyse the characteristics of a festival in detail and then create short films corresponding to the attributes of the festival and its tastes.  Lei says.Besides the advantage in numbers. Lei believes the quality of China s new generation of filmmakers is also improving. As the market enters the film industry. it can give rise to the ¡®industrialisation  of these young people s filmmaking process. It gives them access to a professional team and some very good. first-rate actors in the creative group. Southern Afternoon director Lan says that young Chinese filmmakers are passionate about making short films.  From my perspective. a lot of people are flocking to short films with great passion. which is a very moving thing to see. Lan s work previously won the best short film award at China s First International Film Festival ¨C which focuses on promoting young filmmaking talent in China ¨C where it had to compete with other strong entries such as Li s I Have No Legs. And I Must Run.Song Wen. co-founder of the First festival. believes that the style of China s young filmmakers is evolving.  No more showing off. These works. as a whole. are more focused on humanistic temperament. More importantly. most of them focus on social issues. family relationships. and people s problems.  A lot of people in the younger generation. like us. see ourselves as having ¡®a sense of mission .  Lan adds.Although short films from China are enjoying their moment in the sun. the shadow looming over the country s feature films has not dissipated.The tightening of censorship is one important factor.  The number of feature films going to the international stage has decreased sharply.  says He Xuan. a Chinese film producer. It s harder and harder to get a ¡®dragon mark .  he continues. referring to the public screening licence that is required for films to participate in international festivals.  and the overall review time [for the films to be vetted by officials] is getting longer and longer. The comments about revisions also lack details. Another major factor is the downturn in commercial filmmaking under China s strict  dynamic zero  Covid-19 policy.  From a domestic perspective. the environment of the industry is less than ideal during the pandemic. It has led to many young director teams going into hibernation for as long as three years.  Lei says.When the pandemic environment finally eases. the young directors behind those critically acclaimed short films of recent years may well represent the future of China s feature-film making.Wei Shujun is one of the young filmmakers who has turned to shooting feature films. After his short film On the Border was recognised at Cannes in 2018. Wei s first two features. Striding into the Wind (2020) and Ripples of Life (2021). have both been selected by Cannes.During his interview with the Post. Lan also says that he s planning to extend his short Southern Afternoon into a feature-length film. It is one of two feature films that he s currently developing.However. Shi Chuan. vice-chairman of the Shanghai Film Association. believes that many of these young filmmakers still have a long way to go to establish themselves as feature film directors. When they enter the workplace. the first thing they have to face is the acceptance of the market. so it is completely different from making short films. Critics mainly look at the creativity and personal style of short films; these are the elements that can win awards. but they may not be the most commercially viable.  he says.Lei points out that the rhythm and scale of feature film production are very different from those for a short film.  We still need venture capital and the film festivals to give creators the opportunity to gradually turn their short films into feature films. Compared to Chinese cinema s most glorious days on the international film festival circuit some 20 years ago. the rapid development of commercial filmmaking in China has seen an unmistakable industry shift away from its worship of festivals. From a practical point of view. most Chinese films nowadays will consider the commercial value [first] and sacrifice some personal style and artistry.  Shi says. Therefore. whether Chinese films are not as good as before cannot be judged by international film festivals alone. The environment now is different from that time. and film development strategies are changing.,Entertainment News

If you want to breathe new life into the romantic comedy genre. it helps to breathe some old life into it.At least. that appears to be the lesson from the Julia Roberts-George Clooney Ticket to Paradise. which raked in US$16.3 million at the US box office over its opening weekend. no doubt propelled to its second-place finish (behind the Dwayne Johnson superhero film Black Adam) by the combined star power of its seasoned romantic comedy vets.Despite widespread predictions of the impending extinction of the genre on the big screen. the stronger-than-expected result showed that. for romantic comedy fans. paradise may not be lost quite yet.When the first trailers for Ticket to Paradise appeared this summer. you could be forgiven if you checked the calendar to see what year it was.Everything about the film ¨C its South Pacific setting. its breezy banter. the very presence of the 54-year-old Roberts and 61-year-old Clooney as squabbling divorced parents brought together by the wedding of their daughter (Kaitlyn Dever) ¨C felt like a throwback to an earlier era when such romantic baubles were a staple of going to see a film.But even as today s audiences are inundated with romantic comedy options on the small screen. the nostalgic formula of Ticket to Paradise proved an irresistible draw. particularly to the older film-goers who have been drifting away from cinemas.The film s strong opening stands in marked contrast to the dismal US$4.8-million start for Universal s previous romcom. Bros. which hit cinemas less than a month ago. That film centred on two gay men. played by Billy Eichner and Luke Macfarlane.In the wake of that disappointing opening. Eichner ¨C who also co-wrote the film ¨C suggested close-minded audiences were to blame. That s just the world we live in. unfortunately.  Eichner tweeted. Even with glowing reviews. great Rotten Tomatoes scores. an A CinemaScore etc. straight people. especially in certain parts of the country. just didn t show up for Bros. Jim Orr. president of domestic theatrical distribution for Universal Pictures. dismissed comparisons between Ticket to Paradise and Bros. pointing out that the two films ¨C one a breezy PG-13 confection. the other a more provocative and infinitely raunchier R-rated film ¨C are wildly different. I would not compare and contrast with Bros.  Orr said.  Those are apples and oranges. According to Paul Dergarabedian. senior media analyst at data and analytics company Comscore. the key factor in the two pictures  varying fortunes may come down to movie-star wattage. Bros had nothing close to this star power.  said Dergarabedian. pointing to spring s Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum romantic adventure The Lost City as another throwback film spurred to success by its A-list stars ¨C with a US$105-million gross in North America and US$191 million globally. There s so much romantic comedy available on the small screen that. unless you have that star horsepower to get an audience s attention. you re going to have a tough time getting traction with a romcom in the current marketplace. Still. between the glut of content readily available via streaming. the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on going to see a film. and broader societal shifts in attitudes toward courtship and marriage. today s multiplex remains far less hospitable to the once-reliable romcom genre than it used to be.Even with its healthy start. Ticket to Paradise still lags behind the romcom blockbusters that Roberts and Clooney each regularly made in decades past. Roberts  1999 film Runaway Bride. for example. opened to US$35 million ¨C or more than US$62 million in today s inflation-adjusted dollars.It is worth noting that the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time remains 2002 s My Big Fat Greek Wedding. which grossed more than US$368 million worldwide despite lacking any A-list stars.But while Ticket to Paradise may itself be something of a dinosaur. its box office performance thus far suggests that the asteroid has not entirely wiped out the big-screen romantic comedy yet. This movie is like a comfortable shoe.  Dergarabedian said.  It feels decidedly old-fashioned in a way. but that s actually playing in the film s favour. With all that s going on in the world. going to see Ticket to Paradise is a way for people to just have a fun. escapist experience in the cinema. which is far different from watching this kind of movie at home. Let s see where they are in a month domestically. But I think it will have long-term playability.,Entertainment News
There was a lot of trepidation in the years leading up to the Hong Kong handover. so when my mum was pregnant with me. she flew to Vancouver. Canada. to give birth.She stayed with her brother. whose wife was also pregnant. so it was a happy time ¨C two babies in the family. I was a few months old when my mum returned to Hong Kong with me.I have an older sister and a brother who is a year younger. I went to kindergarten in Hong Kong and. when I was six. the whole family moved to Vancouver.By then it was much closer to the handover and people were freaking out. there was the sense that if you had a visa you should use it. My mum worked in marketing. but she had studied early childhood education and understood the importance of play. so I really had a great childhood.Child s playWe came back to Hong Kong just before the handover. when I was 10. My dad felt there was nothing to be afraid of and I think there were more opportunities workwise for him here.I m glad that we came back because had I stayed (in Canada). I wouldn t be able to speak Chinese. I went to Hong Kong International School (HKIS). picked up my Cantonese. learned Mandarin and had a great high school experience.I was fortunate to have spent part of my childhood in Canada. where I was encouraged to play a lot. and then come back to Hong Kong at an age when academic study becomes more serious. it was the perfect mix ¨C I got to play as a young child and then focus on my studies.I was a lost teenager. but I wasn t the rebellious type.

After a couple of years. I felt there was more I could be doing but I didn t know what.I was introduced to someone who was opening kindergartens in mainland China. The chief operating officer of The Ivy Group said they needed someone who could speak English and Mandarin and encouraged me to go to Beijing and see the set-up. I surprised everyone by deciding pretty quickly to move to Beijing.At the time. kindergartens were a brand new concept on the mainland. Mandatory schooling started in grade one and the kids did nothing before. so there was a pocket of opportunity.Personal capitalI went to Beijing to write a curriculum. but my role morphed into training the campus directors and the teachers. Because they were opening so quickly there was no standardisation. It ended up being myself and a colleague leading the education team.Beijing was my base and I d fly to a second-tier city. help set up the kindergarten and train the campus directors.

It was a big role for someone in her mid- to late-20s. but people say that if you have English and Mandarin and go to live in Beijing you can really leap forward and demonstrate your skills.In Beijing at the time there were a lot of new things happening and an incredible diversity of people. I met journalists. diplomats. people doing start-ups ¨C it was a great time.

I graduated in 2014 and returned to Hong Kong to see what opportunities there were.I was toying with the idea of running my own programme based on technology and early education; at the time there was a huge debate about whether young children should be playing with iPads.Someone suggested I do a pilot at their school in Shenzhen. It went OK. but I wasn t convinced it was what I wanted to do. Some contacts suggested I start a kindergarten.I was reluctant. not just because Hong Kong already has a lot of kindergartens but because I know parents will say that their kids can play. but at the end of the year they will expect them to have certificates. I don t like the concept of certificates. They hand out certificates for children aged two. and even six months old ¨C they need them to apply to a kindergarten. That didn t fit with my approach.Friends in high placesThere was a group of friends and friends of friends. all businesspeople. who wanted to invest in something that I set up ¨C I just didn t know what yet.I had lunch with an acquaintance. a mother of three. who talked about taking her kids to children s museums in the US. When I was in the States. I d done a lot of volunteer work with children and taken them to children s museums. so I knew what these interactive. hands-on play spaces were like.It sounded like the kind of place I d like to work and I googled  children s museums  in Hong Kong and realised there were none. but they had them in Beijing. Taiwan. Bangkok. Seoul and Osaka. and Inner Mongolia was building one.I floated the idea of starting a children s museum to the group of potential investors and they asked to know more. I contacted an HKIS classmate who was living in the States and. as it turned out. was designing children s museums.We agreed that if I could get the funding and she could persuade her American husband to come to Hong Kong we d make it happen.Beyond InstagramI did the sums and realised we d need a large amount of capital upfront. which meant charging high prices to break even. but I wanted to do something for the children of Hong Kong. so they could come and play and also learn.One of the investors suggested I set up a charity. which would mean I could accept donations and grants ¨C which is what we did. The company was formalised in 2016 and it took two years to design and prepare the exhibits. branding and themes.¡®I think I m a difficult person to be with : divorce lawyer Sharon SerThere is an educational purpose behind every exhibit. it s not there because it s cute or Instagrammable. We opened in a 6.600 sq ft (613-square-metre) space in North Point in 2018. But we were informed at the end of 2020 that we had to vacate it.In 2021. we were nomadic and we did a pop-up in Tsuen Wan and Sai Wan Ho. At the moment. we are in a soft-opening stage. which means we can t publicly sell tickets; you have to be invited.We hope by November we can open. and people can buy tickets.The wonder of discoveryI really want adults to play with their child and not be always on their phone.

That didn t fit with my approach.Friends in high placesThere was a group of friends and friends of friends. all businesspeople. who wanted to invest in something that I set up ¨C I just didn t know what yet.I had lunch with an acquaintance. a mother of three. who talked about taking her kids to children s museums in the US. When I was in the States. I d done a lot of volunteer work with children and taken them to children s museums. so I knew what these interactive. hands-on play spaces were like.It sounded like the kind of place I d like to work and I googled  children s museums  in Hong Kong and realised there were none. but they had them in Beijing. Taiwan. Bangkok. Seoul and Osaka. and Inner Mongolia was building one.The past few years has been tough for kids; a lot of them don t have social skills. they don t know how to read facial expressionsSerena FanI floated the idea of starting a children s museum to the group of potential investors and they asked to know more. I contacted an HKIS classmate who was living in the States and. as it turned out. was designing children s museums.We agreed that if I could get the funding and she could persuade her American husband to come to Hong Kong we d make it happen.Beyond InstagramI did the sums and realised we d need a large amount of capital upfront. which meant charging high prices to break even. but I wanted to do something for the children of Hong Kong. so they could come and play and also learn.One of the investors suggested I set up a charity. which would mean I could accept donations and grants ¨C which is what we did. The company was formalised in 2016 and it took two years to design and prepare the exhibits. branding and themes.¡®I think I m a difficult person to be with : divorce lawyer Sharon SerThere is an educational purpose behind every exhibit. it s not there because it s cute or Instagrammable. We opened in a 6.600 sq ft (613-square-metre) space in North Point in 2018. But we were informed at the end of 2020 that we had to vacate it.In 2021. we were nomadic and we did a pop-up in Tsuen Wan and Sai Wan Ho. At the moment. we are in a soft-opening stage. which means we can t publicly sell tickets; you have to be invited.We hope by November we can open. and people can buy tickets.The wonder of discoveryI really want adults to play with their child and not be always on their phone. I understand parenting is tiring and everyone needs a break. but there is something so important about the parent and child experiencing something fun together and not just doing homework and asking about grades.When parents come with the mindset of  I m going to learn something. too  and they get curious. that dynamic changes.Fan hikes Mount Rinjani. in Indonesia. in 2016.

I love young children and find it super fascinating to see when a young child figures something out. And I find observing adult-child relationships equally interesting.The past few years has been tough for kids; a lot of them don t have social skills. they don t know how to read facial expressions. When we first opened after social restrictions eased. children were petrified to step into our museum because they had been indoors in their own space for so long.I hope all Hong Kong children will have the chance to come to the Hong Kong Children s Discovery Museum.,Entertainment News
The resurgence of state-run  cooperatives  and food kitchens in communities across China does not suggest that Beijing is reversing its market-reform and opening-up efforts. according to analysts.Instead. they say. it reflects China s increasing push to bridge the urban-rural divide while also ensuring that the nation s ageing population is cared for.But discussions over these types of community-level operations Ã¿ popular during China s planned-economy era and into the 1980s Ã¿ come amid rising public concerns and a lack of confidence following the recently concluded 20th party congress. where a leadership reshuffle has shrouded the future of Chinese economic policies.These  supply and marketing cooperatives  Ã¿ which. despite the name. are state-run entities Ã¿ have become increasingly ubiquitous in the decade since President Xi Jinping took office. with almost all villages and towns having them.In a note in 2020. Xi highlighted the pivotal role that the cooperatives play in serving farmers. driving rural development and alleviating poverty. By the end of that year. official figures put the total number of such cooperatives at 37.652 across China Ã¿ 5.187 more than in 2019. We should deepen the comprehensive reform of supply and marketing cooperatives. improve the system and widen its service coverage Ã¿ let it become the bridge between the government and the farmers.  Xi said.But researchers from Anbound. a multinational independent think tank. noted how the concepts of such state-run cooperatives and food kitchens are closely associated with China s unsuccessful planned economy from more than four decades ago.They also said that the heated public discourse reflects. to a certain extent. a lack of confidence in the current domestic market. Many people are beginning to have growing concerns about China s adherence to the implementation of the socialist market economic system; adherence to reform and opening up; and protection of private property rights and private wealth.  said an Anbound report published last week.But linking these new cooperatives with China s old command economy  is a myth and misleading . according to Wu Changhai. deputy director of the Capital Finance Institute at the China University of Political Science and Law. In the past. the old cooperatives were intended to solve the shortage and distribution of agricultural supplies and commodities. and they serve the planned economy system. While the new cooperatives are there to serve the market economy and provide a distribution channel to sell and buy farmers  produce. From a legal standpoint. he added. they do not have administrative powers any more. and they only provide guidance and services in production and marketing for farmers.Last month. the provincial federation of supply and marketing co-operatives in the central province of Hubei said that they had successfully restored and expanded rural supply and marketing cooperatives. with the number of rural members reaching a total of 452.000 in the province. while the number of farmer members quintupled in five years and reached 333.000 in 2021.Their counterpart federation in Ningxia province also said last month that the state-run stores span 92.7 per cent of the province s rural regions. compared with 56 per cent in 2017.But lingering fears of a potential economic regression in the world s second-largest economy were recently exacerbated by the news of the establishment of state-owned food kitchens in the northern province of Hebei.The province said that every city needs to set up at least 50 nutritional kitchens this year. and that every city should have at least 500 such facilities by 2025.The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development also issued an announcement last week with plans to set up pilot service infrastructure systems in selected neighbourhoods. including convenience stores. food kitchens. and delivery package stations.However. the authorities said the neighbourhood food kitchens are meant to provide local residents Ã¿ especially the elderly demographic Ã¿ with convenient dining services. as the country is grappling with a rapidly ageing population. Last year. China had 267.36 million people aged over 60. accounting for 18.9 per cent of the total population. according to official figures.Despite playing a less dominant role. community-level co-ops have never disappeared. and now the country is attaching greater importance to such institutions. especially as platforms to push rural revitalisation.The supply and marketing co-operatives were highlighted in a government document issued earlier this year in the layout of a rural commercial system. as well as in the rural logistical system.The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives reported that the country s supply and marketing co-operatives showed steady sales growth in the first half of the year. as total sales climbed 19.1 per cent to top 2.94 trillion yuan (US$409 billion).Online sales on the fupin832.com platform. which was established in 2020 to support poverty relief and help sell agricultural products across China. have increased by 33 per cent over last year. the federation said.The system helped meet the demand for fertiliser in the face of a shortage. contributing to stabilising prices and the country s food security. according to the federation.Nearly three years of strict zero-Covid measures have taken a toll on the world s second-largest economy. the push for reform and opening up has slowed. and some economic progress has been compromised. rousing market concerns that the economy could regress into a more closed and conservative direction.Foreign investors and private entrepreneurs alike have also been crippled by constant production disruptions and dampened expectations.But Beijing has continued to vow that the nation s private sector will be more developed. while highlighting the importance of increased market scrutiny.The party has also reaffirmed its resolve to  unwaveringly  open up the market further to foreign investors and continue to improve the country s business environment.And with China placing more emphasis on self-reliance in the face of extremely complex external challenges with intensifying geopolitical tensions. the downward economy has eroded market confidence to the point that even uncorroborated news reports and speculation can spark considerable unease.The 20th party congress report said China will  uphold and improve the basic socialist economic system. unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy. unswervingly encourage. support. and guide the development of the non-public economy. give full play to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation. and better play the role of the government .The report also emphasised Beijing s vow to bolster and protect private enterprises while continuing to  promote high-level opening up . and to  create a market-oriented. legalised. and international first-class business environment  for foreign businesses.,Business News
China s foreign exchange reserves rose unexpectedly in October. official data showed on Monday. as the US dollar fell against other major currencies.The country s foreign exchange reserves Ã¿ the world s largest Ã¿ rose by US$23.47 billion to US$3.052 trillion last month. compared with US$3.018 trillion tipped in a Reuters poll of analysts and US$3.029 trillion in September.The yuan fell by 2.5 per cent against the US dollar in October. while the US dollar fell by 0.6 per cent in October against a basket of other major currencies.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in a statement that the increase in October reserves mainly reflected valuation effects. as the US dollar weakened. China will continue to support the overall stability of the size of foreign exchange reserves.  it said.China has been trying to stabilise the yuan. which has fallen nearly 12 per cent against a broadly stronger US dollar this year. amid concerns over capital outflows.China will keep the yuan stable and increase flexibility of the currency. Yi Gang. governor of the People s Bank of China. said last week.China s foreign exchange reserves dropped by US$197.74 billion in the first 10 months of 2022. official data showed.China held 62.64 million fine troy ounces of gold at the end of October. unchanged from the end of September.The value of China s gold reserves fell to US$102.67 billion at the end of October from US$104.72 billion at the end of September.,Business News
In a small town 9km (5.6 miles) west of Bangui. the capital of the Central African Republic. a Chinese-funded solar plant is powering factories. schools and households.Spanning 160.000 square metres (1.7 million sq ft) with more than 30.000 solar panels. the 15 megawatt operation in Bimbo meets about 30 per cent of the capital s power needs.Built by China Energy Engineering Group Tianjin Electric Power Construction. the solar plant. which was finished in June. is one of a slew of new green energy projects being developed in Africa with Chinese expertise.Beijing recently pledged to help 19 African nations combat the effects of climate change. such as floods and drought triggered by a warming planet. Shifting away from fossil fuel energy will be a key plank of China s help.The rush of green investment will do a power of good for the largely impoverished continent. which is on the front lines of climate change. China. meanwhile. will have its image polished overseas.But while most of the development help is likely to be on renewable energy projects and climate mitigation. some African governments may prefer China to help exploit mineral or fossil fuel deposits. analysts say Ã¿ potentially undermining green pledges.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said last month China will pursue  cooperation  with the 19 African nations on climate change and green energy development. China not only helps African countries respond to climate change with every sincerity. but has also lived up to its commitments on global climate response.  Mao said.China has already committed billions of US dollars in financial aid to Africa over the past two decades and says it has built more than 100 clean energy and sustainable development projects on the continent.Analysts say this new pledge is likely to come with loans on favourable terms to build renewable-energy plants or buy Chinese solar-power equipment. I expect China to invest in energy infrastructure and provide financing as a means of aid.  said Liang Yan. professor of economics at Willamette University in the United States. China is also likely to extend technological expertise too. she said.This direction would fit with the Belt and Road Initiative. Liang said. referring to a US$1 trillion. nine-year-old scheme that has built infrastructure across the world to enhance trade links with China.The diverse range of climates across Africa s vast continent. which range from arid deserts to rainforests and glaciers. has warmed more than the global average since the pre-industrial period between 1850 and 1900. according to the United Nations  World Meteorological Organization.Sea levels along Africa s coastlines are also rising faster than most other countries. it said. which is exacerbating the risk of floods and erosion.Over the past 18 months. Ethiopia. Kenya and Somalia have been struggling through a drought due in part to temperatures linked to climate change. The extreme weather has killed crops and cattle while threatening to spread disease and cause widespread hunger. according to global charity Oxfam International.China is well positioned to help mitigate the impacts of climate change because it has been phasing out coal at home in favour of renewable energy. said Barry Sautman. professor emeritus in the social science division at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.The country s carbon  intensity  Ã¿ which measures the weight emitted per unit of energy consumed Ã¿ dropped 48.4 per cent from 2005-20. exceeding an official target. according to a 2021 white paper from the State Council Information Office.While China is making progress in transitioning away from fossil fuels. there is still a long way to go. and new coal-fired plants continue to be built amid concern about energy security in the country.As a development partner overseas. however. China s domination of the global solar supply chain and unparalleled spending on renewable energy give it an edge.China Exim Bank has already funded construction of a 15-megawatt solar power plant in Garissa. a semi-arid region of northeastern Kenya. China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Co-operation built the US$135.7 million plant. which began running in 2019.It provides power for more than 380.000 people and remains one of the largest photovoltaic electricity stations in East Africa.Chinese leaders are likely to approach climate through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). a senior-level dialogue platform that has helped launch numerous projects over the past 22 years. Jili said. The forum aims to advance the use of solar. hydropower and renewable energy in Africa.During last year s FOCAC in Senegal. China promised to increase investment in renewables. as well as energy-saving technologies and low-carbon industries. China has also vowed to stop building coal-fired power projects abroad.To avoid defaults on any loans linked to green energy projects. China would probably cut interest rates or allow delayed repayments. Jili said. This willingness to renegotiate terms relates to its insistence on maintaining a benevolent diplomatic image. which is precisely produced to contrast itself against other Western development partners.  he said.But most of these projects come with a big price tag and some analysts say nations risk being saddled with unsustainable debt. Western officials have warned that some of China s lending for infrastructure has put smaller countries in difficult positions where they cannot afford to repay their loans Ã¿ so-called debt traps. which Beijing rejects vehemently.Zambia became Africa s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter in 2020. It stopped work on several Chinese-funded infrastructure projects and cancelled undisbursed loans. In early September. China and other lenders gave debt relief assurances to the southern African nation. which helped unlock a US$1.3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Uganda owed China US$200 million for its only international airport as of 2021. and Kenya hinted last week it will ask China to change the terms of its US$4.7 billion loan for a railway. China is aware of debt concerns in the region. while at the same time massive market opportunities await through rising energy needs paired with untapped solar and wind resources in Africa.  said Yingzhi Sarah Tang. a research fellow at the Green Finance & Development Centre at Fudan University. China aims to establish itself as a green leader and promote climate governance not only through financing and technology. but also through diplomatic relations. Chinese leaders are looking for political ties with  a significant number of countries that can function as allies in multilateral institutions like the UN but also have access to the key minerals that are going to form the trajectory of tech . Jili said.Some African governments might call on China to help them develop mineral reserves or even deposits of fossil fuels. rather than renewable energy. analysts said.Two Chinese banks were financing four coal-fired power plants under construction in South Africa and Zimbabwe. despite China s climate pledge to shun coal projects.Kenya as a producer of coal would want to make use of its deposits. Sautman said.Elsewhere. civil society groups in Uganda have criticised a Uganda-Tanzania oil pipeline for possible environmental damage and the displacement of households. For relatively poor countries. it s always tempting to use the resources they have on hand rather than alternative sources of energy.  Sautman said.Christoph Nedopil Wang. director of the Shanghai-based Green Finance & Development Centre. said the potential impact of China s development pledge will depend on the willingness of local leaders to focus on sustainable outcomes.Chinese President Xi Jinping told a belt and road forum in November last year that high-quality.  small and beautiful  projects should be a priority in overseas cooperation. He said those projects are sustainable and improve people s livelihoods. Small and beautiful  is part of China s shift from mega infrastructure projects to smaller but profitable ventures under its Belt and Road Initiative. Investors will also take on less risk.Despite the potential of clean energy projects. particularly through distributed solar and other localised solutions. China so far is still engaging in  large-scale fossil energy developments across the region . Wang said.In the first half of 2022. gas projects were the main driver of China s energy financing and investment across Africa. Wang said.Wei Shen. a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in Britain. said data indicated Chinese state-owned enterprises and development finance institutions were pulling back from financing overseas coal-fired power plants after Beijing pledged to do so in October last year. China certainly hopes to promote its world leading renewable energy capacities worldwide. as it did once on conventional energy projects.  Shen said.,Business News
Boxed meals prepared by staff in hazmat suits. herbal medicine handouts. mandatory Covid-19 testing. and strictly enforced social distancing Ã¿ these are just glimpses of daily life inside the world s largest iPhone factory. according to Chinese state media reports. as the plant rushes to shore up confidence after an exodus of workers raised questions about on-site conditions.On Chinese social media platforms. earlier video clips of workers complaining about food and hygiene conditions in the factory. run by Foxconn Technology Group in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. have been replaced by footage posted by official outlets. showcasing happy workers operating under efficient pandemic control measures. For breakfast. we had milk and bread. and if I want more. I can get an extra portion.  Wen Jialong. a Foxconn worker. told Henan Television. praising the three free meals provided by the company each day.Behind the camera. however. some workers said they remain concerned about the risk of infections in the compound. where neither Foxconn nor local authorities have disclosed the number of Covid-19 cases recorded.One worker. who requested anonymity. told the Post that some of his colleagues have chosen to sleep on factory floors. next to the assembly lines. rather than return to dormitories. for fear of catching the virus from neighbours who tested positive.Some even bought tents to sleep in. the worker said.One worker. who said he left the compound last weekend by climbing over a temporary iron fence. said he fled because two of his roommates were confirmed positive but received no medical treatment. I was afraid of being infected. I was afraid that I may die. So I ran.  he said. adding that he walked over 30km on the highway before a truck picked him up.Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.The anxiety experienced by many of Foxconn s nearly 300.000 workers. most of them in their 20s and 30s. reflects the Chinese government s official narrative. which emphasises the coronavirus  health threats to justify draconian lockdowns.After an unknown number of Foxconn workers fled the factory last weekend. however. the local health authority reversed course and started telling people that the health impact of contracting the coronavirus is limited.Still. the Zhengzhou government has gone to extremes to contain the virus. rolling out measures including disinfecting all public places. even though China s national health authority has deemed such actions unnecessary. The city has also reminded residents to disinfect the surface of parcel deliveries.On Wednesday. the 400 square metre (4.300 sq ft) Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone. where Foxconn is located. entered a seven-day de facto lockdown. making it nearly impossible for anyone to enter or leave without prior approval.One worker. who resigned this week but was unable to leave the compound due to the lockdown. told the Post on the phone that the situation on campus is less rosy than what state media portrays. If you don t show up at work. you are not entitled to food or testing.  the worker said. Meanwhile. garbage in the dorm area remained uncleaned. as leftover food and plastic bags piled up around bins. the worker said.The worker said resignation is strongly discouraged at the moment because the factory is ramping up iPhone production for the holiday season in Apple s major markets in the US and Europe.One of Zhengzhou s largest exporters. taxpayers and employers. Foxconn Ã¿ formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Ã¿ has received disease control support from the local government to keep production on track. The company meanwhile has raised its daily cash bonus for workers to 400 yuan (US$55) from 100 yuan the previous week.Despite Foxconn s efforts to sustain production. Reuters on Monday cited an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter as saying that iPhone output at the plant could be cut by up to 30 per cent this month.Kuo Ming-chi. an analyst at TF International Securities who follows Apple s supply chain. estimated that at least 10 per cent of the global iPhone production capacity is affected. although he expected Foxconn s output to gradually improve within a few weeks and maintained his previous forecast of iPhone shipments for this quarter.A report by local newspaper Henan Daily quoted an unidentified person. in charge of the Foxconn unit responsible for assembling the iPhone 14 series. as saying that the plant is in need of workers and the management has called for support from the company s other facilities.Health authorities in Henan province on Thursday reported 22 confirmed Covid-19 cases. 21 in its capital Zhengzhou. Among 165 asymptomatic cases found. 136 were from the city.,Business News
Growth in Taiwan s US$127 billion semiconductor industry. a top supplier for the world s electronic devices. will slow next year as inflation hobbles global consumer sentiment and mainland China faces its own headwinds. market researchers said this week.Output value for the island s integrated circuit sector should increase by 15.6 per cent this year. but by just 6.1 per cent next year. the Taiwan government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute said in a report on Thursday.Taiwan s semiconductor revenue will grow in percentage terms by a  single digits  in 2023. said Ben Yeh. Taiwan-based analyst with the Canalys market research firm. Smaller companies in the space who do not hold leading market positions are also likely to slow down their capacity expansion plans.  Yeh said.The market for chips will probably reach US$605.6 billion this year and US$608.6 billion next year. Taipei-based Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute said in a forecast on Thursday. which pointed to poor consumer  buying mood .Output value for the chip sector grew by 26.7 per cent in 2021 as consumers snatched up PCs and smartphones for remote working and home study during the coronavirus pandemic. the government-funded research firm said.But shipments of both devices are now in decline. according to data from Taipei-based market research firm TrendForce.Continued growth in the output value for Taiwan s integrated circuit sector next year. though. still reflects demand for newer technology. it said. The global economy is in turmoil. but 5G. artificial intelligence and high-performance computing are still creating innovation and business opportunities.  the Industrial Technology Research Institute report said.Developers of consumer electronics Ã¿ companies that range from the Silicon Valley to mainland China Ã¿ regularly order semiconductors from Taiwanese firms.But high levels of inflation. plus increased living costs. will hobble demand for PCs and tablets. market research firm IDC said in June.In September. Taiwan s industrial output fell for the first time in more than two and a half years. signalling trouble in major world markets that traditionally rely on the technology hardware hub as well as for other export-reliant Asian economies.Mainland China. which is normally the world s biggest buyer of smartphones by volume. faces slow growth that has cramped purchases.

Pony Ma Huateng. the chairman and founder of Tencent Holdings. has kept a low profile since his last known public comments about the company in August. Limiting his views to shareholders and the media. the billionaire has pledged to explore new sources of revenue and streamline operations.None of that has materialised.Growth in Tencent s key business units has stagnated. its biggest foreign shareholder Prosus is selling down. and investors have lost US$650 billion in equity wealth since the WeChat operator failed to become the first trillion-dollar Chinese company after the tech-sector crackdown. Growth won t be as fast as before. like 30 per cent or 50 per cent.  said Shawn Yang Zixiao. the Shenzhen-based deputy research head and a managing director at Blue Lotus Capital Group. a boutique investment bank.  Single-digit growth or 10 per cent growth would be more achievable going forward. The result will be pretty weak this year and that s attributed to the macro environment and Tencent s own business operations. Yang. who previously worked at HSBC Global Asset Management. was accurate about his call on Tencent in October last year. when he cut the rating on the stock to sell from buy. He revised the recommendation to buy in August. citing attractive valuation and pricing in of most of the headwinds.Tencent s third-quarter report. which is due on November 16. and earnings guidance from executives will probably give an indication to investors whether the Chinese social-media giant can reset expectations about its business outlook.So far. the projection is bleak. Third-quarter net income may have dropped 36 per cent from a year earlier based on the US accounting standard. while revenue probably fell 0.2 per cent. according to a consensus estimate of analysts tracked by Bloomberg. If that proves to be the case. Tencent s earnings woes will continue. following a 3 per cent revenue decrease in the second quarter. its first decline for the three-month period since the listing in 2004.Tencent declined to comment when contacted by the Post.Tencent s shares have fallen 46 per cent this year. taking the decline to 68 per cent from an all-time high in January 2021. While the nearly two-year-long regulatory crackdown has crushed Tencent s rich valuation. the stock has also taken a beating from a downturn in its games and advertising businesses amid a slowdown in the economy and a flare-up of the pandemic.The tumult is in line with bearish sentiment on other Chinese technology stocks trading in Hong Kong. with sell-offs in Alibaba Group Holding and Meituan contributing to a 42 per cent slump in the Hang Seng Tech Index this year.Tencent s frequent share buy-backs. valued at some HK$25 billion (U$3.2 billion) this year. have failed to stem losses in the stock. surrendering to a massive exodus of foreign capital. BlackRock. Inveso and abrdn are among the global money managers that have been paring holdings of the stock this year. according to Bloomberg data.Analysts have slashed Tencent s price target by almost half over the past 20 months. The 12-month consensus share-price estimate is HK$400.18. implying a 68 per cent gain from the latest close. according to Bloomberg data.To be sure. some see values in the tech juggernaut after almost two years of declines. Goldman Sachs predicted in a report last month that Tencent would resume growth in both revenue and profit starting this quarter. citing its efforts to monetise video accounts and the release of the much-anticipated online survival game. Undawn.Meanwhile. Zhang Kun. China s star money manager at E Fund Management. bought an additional 1.9 million Tencent shares last quarter. saying that investors should focus on the long-term.While Tencent s market valuation has fallen to US$292.1 billion from its peak of US$941.8 billion. it is still the biggest among all the Chinese companies trading domestically and overseas. according to Bloomberg data. It is ranked No 3 in Asia after Saudi Aramco and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.Unless China exits its zero-Covid policy. a major bane cited by economists for hindering economic growth. the fallout for Tencent and other tech platforms may persist longer than expected. With users  willingness to pay for online entertainment being weak and soft online advertising demand. Tencent s consumer internet business faces more short-term pressure than we previously expected.  said Hou Jie. an analyst at Huatai Financial Holdings in Beijing.,Business News
Raymond Cheng. managing director of CGS-CIMB Securities. has a sense of d¨¦ja vu.With Hong Kong s housing market struggling. interest rates soaring and buying power faltering amid a slowing economy. the worrisome debt levels of property developers are in the spotlight.The same was true in the years just before Cheng became an analyst in 2003. At that time. they could not make profits from home sales. Certain developers had tight financials. and most made little profit.  he said.  Generally. the whole cycle from 1997 to 2003 was a very difficult phase for Hong Kong developers. Home builders  gearing ratios ¨C a measure of how much of their operations are funded by debt ¨C at that time were particularly high. at 60 to 70 per cent. Cheng said. Many of them had been aggressive in their land acquisitions. their appetite for risk fuelled by the many opportunities in the market in the 1990s.During the deep correction between 1997 and 2003. when home prices nosedived some 60 per cent. they suddenly found themselves losing money on property sales.The painful experience of those troubled times was enough to make many of them more financially prudent. Over the next few years. gearing levels fell to about 10 to 20 per cent as the developers reined in their expansion and allocated more of their money to investment properties.But the low interest rate environment that s dominated economics since the financial crash of 2008 has fuelled a resurgence of debt. It might have made developers feel the cost [of borrowing] was low.  said Cheng. Certain developers seized the opportunity to expand in mainland China. pushing up their gearing ratios once more.Now. with borrowing costs at a 14-year high and certain to rise further. this could be problematic.Developers are likely to have a hard time turning a profit as the interest payments on their debt mountains get bigger. say analysts. They are likely to be less aggressive bidding for land. and may even come under pressure to offload assets at lower prices. The US interest rate hikes caught developers whose gearing had rapidly increased off-guard.  said Cheng.  It suddenly increased the pressure on their cash flow. Home prices declined by 8.1 per cent in the first nine months of the year. reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and the lingering effects of coronavirus restrictions.Hong Kong property companies have taken on an additional HK$109 billion (US$13.89 billion) of debt in the past three years as they took advantage of low interest rates that lasted until as late as the first half of 2022. when the one-month Hibor (Hong Kong interbank offered rate) ¨C the rate banks charge each other for borrowing money ¨C averaged just 0.2 per cent. according to Morgan Stanley.The average net gearing. or net debt to equity ratio. of developers and landlords has risen from about 15 per cent five to 10 years ago to 22 per cent now. said Cheng.New World Development is the most indebted local homebuilder by this metric. Its net gearing stood at 43.2 per cent in financial year 2022. while Henderson Land Development s was 27.5 per cent as of the end of last year. according to their financial reports.Link Reit. Hang Lung Properties and Hysan Development also saw their gearing ratios increase in recent years. as they stepped up their capital expenditure and acquisition plans. according to Jefferies.Hong Kong s five biggest developers have acquired a combined total of at least HK$121.32 billion of local assets since 2020. according to a tally kept by Colliers based on data of its own and from Real Capital Analytics. the Lands Department and market sources. These acquisitions include government land. urban renewal projects. land premiums. and old buildings purchased through compulsory sales orders.Henderson. known for frequently taking advantage of compulsory sales. has made at least 13 acquisitions worth HK$70 billion since 2020. according to Colliers  figures. It has 27 newly-acquired urban redevelopment projects. enjoying 80 per cent to full ownership. according to its interim results.Notable purchases by Henderson include the HK$50.8 billion Central Harbourfront Site 3 in November 2021 and the government s Murray Road commercial plot in Central for which it paid HK$23.28 billion in May 2017.Despite its higher gearing. New World Development ranked fourth in terms of acquisitions. at HK$11.4 billion. For instance. in May it filed an application to buy the 10 to 20 per cent it does not own of three buildings near Times Square in Causeway Bay through compulsory auction. according to Lands Tribunal documents.In December 2018 it won a 25-year contract to design. build and run Kai Tak Sports Park with the objective to promote sport development in Hong Kong.The cost of servicing debt is likely to hurt developers in the second half of 2022 and beyond as interest rates continue their upward trajectory. Morgan Stanley said in a report on September 19.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised its base rate to 4.25 per cent from 3.5 per cent on Thursday. the sixth increase in eight months to a fresh 14-year high. in lockstep with the Federal Reserve which is battling sky-high inflation.Henderson. Hysan and Link Reit s interest expenses rose by 25 to 29 per cent from a year earlier after new acquisitions added to their debt piles. according to Morgan Stanley.For New World Development. with floating debt of HK$123 billion. every 100 basis points rise in interest rate pushes up its cash interest expenses by HK$1.2 billion. the American investment bank estimated in another report on October 6.Developers contacted by the Post sought to play down market concerns about their debt repayments. To say that the group s gearing remains at a high level would be a faulty generalisation.  Henderson s spokeswoman said. Over the past two years. the group s net gearing has been managed prudently and conservatively at a moderate level of mid-20s in percentage terms. A significant portion of Henderson s debt is in fixed-rate notes and bonds. and the group has arranged interest rate swaps to guard against risks related to the its borrowing. she added.A spokeswoman for Hang Lung Properties said its net gearing is considered  stable and healthy . at 26.9 per cent as of June 30. Hang Lung will continue to adopt prudent financial discipline.  she added.New World Development said it has been taking measures to remain  resilient . We have and will continue to proactively manage our net gearing ratio.  said a spokesperson for the company. Since FY21. we have successfully controlled capex [capital expenditure] to below our original budget. We will continue to meticulously examine every land acquisition initiative and capex item. Indeed. Hong Kong s developers are unlikely to face the crisis their mainland peers are going through. because they have a higher proportion of rental income. which is less prone to risk. Mainland developers  rental income from investment properties occupies less than 10 per cent. maybe just 5 per cent. of their profit on average.  said Cheng.  The investment property rental income of Hong Kong developers makes up 40 to 50 per cent of profit on average. Still. their profitability will undoubtedly be hurt.Morgan Stanley said it cut its estimates for New World s earnings per share by 35 per cent and 47 per cent for the financial years of 2023 and 2024. respectively. This mainly reflected higher interest costs. lower development property bookings and a fall in investment property profit. it said in the October 6 report.Landlords with major development plans or acquisitions may see their profitability squeezed by higher rates. according to Jefferies  report.Increases in borrowing costs have an effect on land prices. Expectations of interest rate rises tend to make developers less aggressive at auction.The Urban Renewal Authority in late October awarded a redevelopment project in To Kwa Wan to Sino Land Company and China Merchants Land for HK$2.39 billion. The price per square foot at HK$8.571 was 9.8 per cent lower than the bottom end of market estimates compiled by Vincent Cheung. managing director of Vincorn Consulting and Appraisal.The interest rate upcycle has prompted some developers to sell assets. For example. New World Development and Swire Properties have got rid of non-core assets such as car parks.New World expects to sell around HK$10 billion of non-core assets in the next financial year. We will continue to dispose of our non-core assets to retain capital.  said the developer s spokesperson. We ll have over HK$8 billion of income booked from development properties in FY23. Together with an increase in our recurring income. it ll more than offset the additional interest expense. Disposing of non-core assets is a part of Swire Properties  strategy to ensure long-term growth. a spokeswoman said in a statement. This strategy has put us in a strong position to fuel our HK$100 billion investment plan over the next decade.  she said.She said 72 per cent of Swire Properties  borrowings are on a fixed-rate basis. which helps mitigate the impact of the rising interest rates.The general offloading of assets is a good opportunity for buyers to negotiate lower prices. said Ingrid Cheh. head of Hong Kong real estate at Schroders Capital. Landlords are likely to be more open to price cuts.Jefferies  report on October 5 said  the interest rate is the major culprit behind recent property price weakness .During past rate hike cycles. the impact on house prices was not as pronounced because the magnitude and pace of the increases were smaller. while a supply shortfall acted as a counterbalance.This time. the upcycle has coincided with a downturn in the property market.DBS expects Hong Kong home prices to fall 5 per cent next year. Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley. HSBC. JLL and Colliers have all predicted a decline too.Goldman s predictions have been the direst. It expects home prices to plummet by 30 per cent by the end of 2023. as sharply increasing interest rates continue to pressure affordability and repel investors from the market.The government has taken steps to try to buoy the market.Hong Kong s Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu. in his maiden policy address. announced a refund of the extra stamp duty eligible non-locals pay when buying Hong Kong homes ¨C should they stay for seven years and get permanent residency.The move came after developers had been lobbying the government to scrap property cooling measures as transactions were expected to fall to their lowest level in three decades.It was met with some scepticism from property analysts. however. who said refunding the cash at a later date would not make homes any more affordable.The outlook remains uncertain. according to Kathy Lee. head of research at Colliers. There are still a lot of external uncertainties including interest rate hikes and China s economic growth.  said Lee.,Business News
The gloves are coming off in the US-China chip war as Washington announces sweeping trade and investment restrictions on semiconductors. There will be no winners and many losers in this bid for technological. economic and strategic supremacy between the world s biggest economic powers.There is far more at stake than just chips as the two economic giants enter their monumental struggle. For example. the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has noted that.  given its strong trade and supply chain links. Asia has a lot to lose in the event of fragmentation where the world divides into separate trading blocs .This is of course true. especially in the short to medium term. But what the Biden administration appears to be overlooking in its aggressive-defensive dash to prevent China drawing abreast of. or even overtaking. the US as an economic and strategic rival is that it risks provoking the very process that it wishes to avoid.This is in fact precisely what is happening now as the Biden administration doubles down by first orchestrating a wave of economic sanctions against Russia and then by imposing unilateral  security  measures against China in the form of restrictions on key semiconductor exports and investment.China is reacting by pouring financial and human resources into catching up with the US. as economist and associate professor at the London School of Economics Keyu Jin noted recently in The New York Times. But this is only one element of a much wider (Russo) Chinese initiative designed to counter Washington s strategies.Economists Diego Cerdeiro. Siddharth Kothari and Chris Redl at the IMF warned in a recent blog post that  geopolitical tensions have raised the prospect that strategic competition and national security concerns may trump the shared economic benefits of global trade .In its Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific. the IMF has also noted  worrying early signs of fragmentation. with trade policy uncertainty spiking and countries imposing more trade restrictions .The US and China are being drawn into a zero-sum game to outdo each other. Blame lies partly with the combative tactics of the Trump and Biden administrations but apportioning blame does not alter the fact that the world is headed for economic confrontation. or worse. between the two powers.Most people are well aware of the way in which the US has courted  allies  in Europe. Asia and beyond (many of them going along only reluctantly) to stem China s rise as an economic and strategic rival. But they are less well aware of how successful China also has been in this regard.As Ishtiaq Ahmed. a member of the Pakistan Planning Commission and a prominent academic. commented recently:  With Europe and the US facing a mounting economic crisis caused by the Ukraine war. China and Russia have geared up the process of economic and security integration across Asia. The latest illustration of Asian regionalism is the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) which decided at its recent summit in Kazakhstan to transform itself into a full-fledged organisation for economic and security cooperation in Asia. according to Ahmed. Its 27 member states account for two-thirds of global GDP. China and Russia have steered its evolution to include countries from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. It has also concluded a partnership agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). which was created in 2015 by the founding members of Belarus. Kazakhstan and Russia.The EAEU provides for free movement of goods. services. capital and labour among its member states. Though far from achieving the intended goals of an EU-like customs union and common market. it has enabled Russia to bypass Western sanctions and import restricted goods from Kazakhstan.Meanwhile. the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has established a niche as an integrated intergovernmental body. Its summit in September consolidated economic. security and political cooperation among China. Russia. Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan. Tajikistan. India and Pakistan.China has emerged also as a key player in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) which in Ahmed s view will  ultimately enable China to write trade rules for the region. at the expense [of] the ¡®rules-based  free trade regime being propounded by the US .East-versus-West rivalry is focused for the moment sharply upon the US-China semiconductor wars which make headlines almost daily in international media outlets. But what is happening in China s. and to some extent Russia s. economic hinterland could prove to be of greater long-term consequence.Wang Huiyao. president of the Beijing think tank Centre for China and Globalisation. observes in his recent book The Ebb and Flow of Globalisation that the form that emerged after World War II has been dominated by institutions. norms and ideas shaped by a relatively small group of countries led by the US.Wang asserts that in future  no single country or narrow alliance will be able to dictate global norms and rules by itself . Yet nationalisms die hard and it is clear that US and China-led alliances are going to generate bitter conflicts before anything approaching true globalisation emerges. What state the world will be in by that time is anyone s guess.,Business News
After the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the fourth straight time this year. financial markets are beginning to shake. The interest rate rises in response to higher inflation is a reversal of nearly two decades of generally declining global interest rates. higher asset bubbles and anaemic growth.The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recently issued a paper looking at the policy implications of exchange rate swings. The US dollar index has broadly appreciated 10 per cent against the other currencies since the beginning of the year. 15.2 per cent since its recent low in June 2021 and 46.8 per cent since its 12-year low in August 2011.The Japanese yen hit a recent low of 150 to the US dollar on October 20. Eisuke Sakakibara. Japan s former vice-minister of finance who is known as  Mr Yen . has hinted the yen could go to 170.The BIS attributes three factors to the appreciation of the US dollar: an improvement in US terms of trade with higher oil prices that affect Europe and Japan as oil importers; divergence in monetary policy stance as the Fed is more aggressive in raising rates than the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan; and flight to quality because of war and fears of recession.Where you stand depends on where you sit. Economists tend to look at prices and flows. which are changes in stock over time. because these are the most readily available numbers.However. if you look at Earth from 30.000 feet up. you see broadly the stock position while flows are small changes from that height. At ground level. you only see flows because the big stocks do not appear to change that fast.Reality requires us to look at both stock and flows. which is why we must examine the balance sheet effect of price and flow changes. The Japanese were the first to understand the process of ageing and balance sheet effects.After the 1980s asset bubble reversals arising from the rapid appreciation of the yen versus the US dollar. Japan went through a balance sheet deflation. That meant Japanese companies and households spent the next three decades rebuilding their balance sheets aided by near-zero interest rates.What Japan did had world-shaking implications that many analysts ignored. With the big swings in the yen. Japanese GDP in yen terms has been roughly flat but in US dollar terms has declined from a peak of US$6.27 trillion in 2012 to US$4.9 trillion at the end of 2021. However. in terms of net international investment position. Japan has built up a formidable war chest of 411.2 trillion yen (US$2.8 trillion).In other words. in preparation for an ageing population plus slower domestic growth. Japan shifted its financial assets abroad on a massive scale so that depreciation in the yen would mean higher income and wealth effects from foreign earnings.The architect of this transformation is Governor Haruhiko Kuroda of the BOJ. Under his watch. the BOJ now owns more than half of Japanese government bonds. continuing to buy them to maintain a flat zero yield curve under what is called yield curve control.In effect. Japanese pension funds are protected from Japanese inflation and interest rate increases since long-term bonds are shifted to BOJ balance sheet. BOJ holdings of Japanese government bonds are US$3.6 trillion. almost identical to net Japanese surplus in foreign assets.How does US dollar strengthening affect global balance sheets? The US net liability position has deteriorated to US$18.1 trillion at the end of 2021. of which Japan accounted for about 20 per cent and East Asia surplus economies ¨C Japan. China. Hong Kong. Taiwan and Singapore ¨C accounting for almost 56 per cent.As the BIS analysis shows. US dollar strengthening is generally bad for the world economy because higher US interest rates tighten trade finance liquidity and weighs on financial stability on those sovereign and corporate borrowers in US dollars.While European and Japanese interest rates become cheap in relative terms as the US dollar strengthens. the carry trade will increase. This accelerates dollar strengthening until it s time to take profits. The carry trade was instrumental to financial accidents in both the 1997 and 2008 crashes.The US economy is sitting pretty from a macro perspective. but how long can the US dollar continue to strengthen? The global rich class loves a stronger US dollar because it protects their interests. but they worry that global liquidity tightening will result in deflation. When it begins to weaken. expect no loyalty from the rich.This balance sheet view shows that exchange rate shifts reflect fundamental big-picture structural changes. and the strength of the US dollar matters in the geopolitical power game. If the United States uses this window of opportunity to do major reforms. the strength of the US dollar would reinforce the view that the US is back.If the markets perceive that the macroeconomic management is flawed. like what happened to sterling in September. then the markets can be brutal in punishing such mistakes. This is why I am watching for if and when BOJ monetary policy reverses course. That is when small waves could signal a tsunami ahead.,Business News
