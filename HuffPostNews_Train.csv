Changing the filter for your home s heating. ventilation and air conditioning system. or HVAC. is one of those tasks you probably forget to do as often as you should. Some people may even be unaware that they have an HVAC filter that needs to be changed. And it s a really important item to swap out.the University of Rochester Medical Center reportsSo as we trudge through a fall when flu. COVID-19 and RSV are all rampant. it s even more important to make sure your home is filled with fresh and clean air. Here s when you should change your HVAC filter and why it s so important to do so to help stop the spread of viruses.ndoor air quality is very important for [your] quality of life and health and well-being.  said Dr. Mark Loafman. a family medicine doctor at Cook County Health in Chicago.  And the filters we have on our HVAC systems are the prime and oftentimes the only source of air cleaning we have access to. Your air filter helps make sure the circulating air in your home is clean so your HVAC system isn t simply pushing through contaminated air over and over. This is particularly important during times of high virus spread ― like right now.We learned from COVID-19 that virus-containing droplets can hang in the air for a long time. Loafman noted. This makes it all the more important to think about the quality of the air we re breathing. whether that is at home. at a restaurant or on an airplane.An HVAC filter can help pull those droplets from the air before infecting someone else. Loafman said. although he cautioned that people should also take other precautions to prevent the spread of viruses.In order for your HVAC filter to clean the air properly. you need to make sure the filters aren t full of already-collected particles and dust.according to the United States Environmental Protection AgencyThe higher a filter s MERV rating. the smaller the particles it can catch. Filters can catch particles that are between 0.3 and 10 microns. according to the EPA.2 microns in sizeas the minimum rating for home usethe EPA The better the filter. the quicker it s going to clog and need to be changed.  Loafman said.  Erring on the side of more frequent as opposed to less frequent changing is a good idea. You ll quickly be able to tell what a dirty HVAC filter looks like — it s generally covered in dust. hair and is brown in color. Unused HVAC filters are white.Changing your HVAC filter is only one piece of the virus-prevention puzzle.  These are not a replacement for the other strategies.  Loafman said. You still need to make sure you are up-to-date on vaccinations for the flu and COVID-19. wash your hands. isolate if you re sick and wear a mask in crowded spaces. ,Health News
NASHVILLE. Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee s strict abortion ban does not apply to the disposal of fertilized human embryos that haven t been transferred to a uterus. according to a recent state attorney general opinion.The determination is among the first issued by an attorney general that provides insight on how laws heavily restricting abortion affect those seeking in vitro fertilization. or IVF. since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Disposing of an embryo that was created outside a woman s body and that has never been transferred to a woman s body thus does not qualify as ‘abortion.   Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in his opinion.The two-page document was quietly published on the attorney general s website on Oct. 20 at the request of Tennessee s Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson. a Republican currently seeking reelection.Tennessee s lawtrigger law While I felt that the law was clear and that it did not apply to this particular case and others like it. I was more than happy to ask the Attorney General for his opinion to clear up any perceived misunderstandings in the law and was pleased that the Attorney General arrived at the same conclusion.  Johnson said.While Skrmetti s opinion clarifies the disposal of unused embryos. it remains unclear if the law applies to the selective reduction process sometimes used to remove a fetus from a woman s womb if fertility treatments result in multiple pregnancies.A spokesperson for the attorney general s office did not immediately respond to comment Friday.Earlier this year. a Tennessee woman went viral after publishing a video detailing an emailed back-and-forth conversation with Republican state Rep. Ryan Williams over the disposal of human embryos.Williams initially wrote that  life does begin at conception either in the womb or in the IVF clinic.  and that doctors who discard those embryos would be a violation of state law — a punishment that carries a felony conviction and $10.000 fine.Williams told The Associated Press he has since met with several attorneys and now says his interpretation of the law was incorrect.He provided an email showing that he emailed the woman back to  extend his sincerest apologies  surrounding his original response.,Health News

AUSTIN. Texas (AP) — A Texas doctor said Thursday he is working with state police to determine whether any of the 21 people killed in the Uvalde school shooting could have been saved had medical help arrived sooner.The review of autopsies and other records is part of a criminal investigation by Texas Rangers into the hesitant police response at Robb Elementary School in May. said Dr. Mark Escott. who serves as the city of Austin s chief medical officer.nearly 400 law enforcement officersEscott said he asked the Texas Department of Public Safety to do the review. which he described as in line with steps taken following other mass shootings in the U.S. We expect that we will find some lessons learned that can be applied to policy around the country.  Escott said.was first reported by the Austin American-StatesmanIt was not clear how much the findings will impact the state s criminal investigation. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday.Escott said the the review could take between three and six months and expressed hoped that the results will quickly be made public. Four other physicians who are EMS and trauma specialists. along with other expert advisors. will also help in the review. Escott said.He said the review will look at autopsy reports and medical records from hospitals and paramedics who treated the victims. Among the questions. Escott said. is whether victims could have survived if they had received first response help within 10 minutes and arrived at a trauma center within an hour. The challenge we have in Uvalde is it is a small community and there are limited EMS resources and the closest level 1 or level 2 trauma center is 90 minutes away.  he said.Last week. Col. Steve McCraw. Texas  state police chief. said the criminal investigation into the police response to the shooting led by Texas Rangers would be wrapped up by the end of the year and turned over to prosecutors. He didn t indicate whether charges would be recommended against any officers. did not fail  Uvalde,Health News
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An Indianapolis doctor who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio is suing Indiana s attorney general. seeking to block him from using allegedly  frivolous  consumer complaints to issue subpoenas seeking patients  confidential medical records.The lawsuit targeting Attorney General Todd Rokita was filed Thursday in Marion County on behalf of Dr. Caitlin Bernard. an Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist. her medical partner. Dr. Amy Caldwell. and their patients.It alleges that Rokita has issued subpoenas seeking the medical records of patients based on complaints from people who have never been a patient of either Bernard or Caldwell and  who lack any personal knowledge of the alleged circumstances giving rise to the complaints. The suit contends that Rokita has  completely ignored  a state requirement that his office first determine that consumer complaints have  merit  before he can investigate physicians and other licensed professionals and that his conduct  violates numerous Indiana statutes.  The Attorney General has wholly ignored the General Assembly s fine-tuned structure for handling consumer complaints regarding licensed professionals and has engaged in precisely the type of overbearing. harassing conduct that the General Assembly sought to prohibit.  the suit states.she gave an interview to The Indianapolis Star about the 10-year-old girlU.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

It also seeks such injunctions to block him from issuing subpoenas related to an investigation based on a consumer complaint  without first making a valid and proper determination that the consumer complaint has merit.  and to prevent Rokita from  violating confidentiality provisions imposed by law. The suit names as defendants Rokita and Scott Barnhart. the chief counsel of the state attorney general s office and also director of its office of consumer protection.It alleges that the  improper conduct  by Rokita and Barnhart  threatens patients seeking legal abortions that their most personal and private medical records and health care decisions could be exposed as part of a meritless investigation. Rokita s press secretary. Kelly Stevenson. said Thursday in response to a request for comment on the lawsuit that the attorney general s office investigates  thousands of potential licensing. privacy. and other violations a year.

Monkeypoxreport presentedThe committee agreed that there has been progress in lowering cases but that transmission remains high in certain regions. and there s  an emerging potential for greater health impact in vulnerable populations.  The number of reported cases has dropped for eight straight weeks. This is very encouraging.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the committee late last month ahead of the report s release.  But progress in the Americas is less certain. and this region accounted for almost 90% of cases reported last week. Several countries are still entering the peak phase of the outbreak. and there is likely to be under reporting in others. gradually dropping This drop in cases has been attributed to an abundance of vaccine supplies and educational outreach changing sexual behavior among those who are at higher risk of infection. The outbreak has been largely contained among sexually active men who have sex with multiple male partners. according to public health officials.

toll of opioidsTogether. the developments amount to what could be the last round of huge settlements after years of litigation over the drug industry s role in an overdose crisis that has been linked to more than 500.000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades.In the lawsuits. governments said pharmacies filled prescriptions they should have flagged as inappropriate.The deals call for most of the funds from Woonsocket. Rhode Island-based CVS and Deerfield. Illinois-based Walgreens to be used to fight the opioid crisis through such efforts as expanding treatment and support programs for people with addiction. along with providing overdose antidotes and launching prevention efforts.In a conference call with analysts Wednesday. CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch said the deal sprang from mediation discussions that started last month.Under the tentative plans. CVS would pay $4.9 billion to local governments and about $130 million to Native American tribes over a decade. Walgreens would pay $4.8 billion to governments and $155 million to tribes over 15 years. The exact amount depends on how many governments join the deals.CVS announced its plan along with an earnings report Wednesday. and Walgreens made an SEC filing with some details. We are pleased to resolve these longstanding claims and putting them behind us is in the best interest of all parties. as well as our customers. colleagues and shareholders.  Thomas Moriarty. CVS chief policy officer and general counsel. said in a statement.  We are committed to working with states. municipalities and tribes. and will continue our own important initiatives to help reduce the illegitimate use of prescription opioids. The companies noted they have have launched educational programs and installed safe disposal units for drugs in stores and police departments. among other measures designed to reduce misuse of opioids. As one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation. we remain committed to being a part of the solution. and this settlement framework will allow us to keep our focus on the health and wellbeing of our customers and patients. while making positive contributions to address the opioid crisis.  Walgreens said in a statement.Neither CVS nor Walgreens is admitting wrongdoing.Paul Geller. a lawyer for governments in the lawsuits. said talks with Walmart continue. Walmart representatives would not comment Wednesday. These agreements will be the first resolutions reached with pharmacy chains and will equip communities across the country with the much-needed tools to fight back against this epidemic and bring about tangible. positive change.  lawyers for local governments said in a statement.  In addition to payments totaling billions of dollars. these companies have committed to making significant improvements to their dispensing practices to help reduce addiction moving forward. finalized and completed settlements One by one. we are holding every player in the addiction industry accountable for the millions of lives lost or devastated by the opioid epidemic.  Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement.

abortionThe study. which waspublished Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. analyzed requests for medication abortion across 30 Republican-leaning states using data from Aid Access. an Austria-based telemedicine service that mails abortion pills to people in the U.S.Researchers found that requests for the pills ― already the most common abortion method in the U.S. ― went from an average of 83 per day to 137 per day after the court s draft decision on abortion access was leaked to the public in May. In the two months after the court released its formal decision in June. those requests averaged around 214 per day. Every state. regardless of abortion policy. showed a higher request rate during the periods after the leak and after the formal decision announcement. with the largest increases observed in states enacting total bans.  the researchers found. with Louisiana. Mississippi. Arkansas. Alabama and Oklahoma seeing the biggest upticks. In states that enacted total abortion bans. patients overwhelmingly said they were seeking out medication abortion because of laws stopping them from terminating pregnancies. Sixty-two percent of patients who requested abortion pills after the court s decision cited  current abortion restrictions  as their reason for needing them. compared to 31% before the leak.as abortion providers warned would happenRequests for medication abortion have skyrocketed even though many states have made it illegal to provide them. But Aid Access has been able to circumvent this. The group uses only doctors in Europe to provide virtual abortion care for patients in states that ban the pills. and those doctors face little legal risk for violating a U.S. state law from outside the country. U.S. patients can receive the pills in one to three weeks for about $100.state laws against medication abortion61 cases,Health News
There s an old saying that adversity makes you stronger. Real life shows that s not always true. but the adage highlights an evolving debate among scientists about resilience.After traumatic events and crises such as child abuse. gun violence or a pandemic. what explains why some people bounce back. while others struggle to cope? Is it nature — genes and other inherent traits? Or nurture — life experiences and social interactions?Decades of research suggest both play a role. but that neither seals a person s fate.Although scientists use different definitions. resilience generally refers to the ability to handle severe stress.Association.researchScientists have conducted numerous studies trying to answer why some kids are more vulnerable to those experiences than others.California pediatrician and researcher Dr. Thomas Boyce decided to dig deeper into that question because of his own family history. He and his sister. who is two years younger. were extremely close amid sometimes turbulent family circumstances. As they grew into adulthood. Boyce s life seemed blessed by good luck. while his sister sank into hardship and mental illness.In laboratory tests. Boyce found that about 1 in 5 kids have elevated biological responses to stress. He found signs of hyperactivity in their brains  fight-or-flight response and in their stress hormones. Real-world evidence showed kids like these have higher rates of physical and mental troubles when raised in stressful family situations. But evidence also shows these hyper-sensitive kids can thrive with nurturing. supportive parenting. Boyce says.Ananda Amstadter. who studies traumatic stress and genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University. said her research suggests that stress resilience is roughly half influenced by genes and half by environmental factors. But she emphasized that many genes are likely involved. there is no single  resilience gene.″In other studies. Duke University researchers Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi have linked variations in genes that help regulate mood with increased risks for depression or antisocial behavior in kids who experienced child abuse or neglect.But  genes are not destiny.  says Dr. Dennis Charney. academic affairs president at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. who has studied ways to overcome adversity.Trauma can affect the development of key brain systems that regulate anxiety and fear. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication can sometimes help people who ve experienced severe trauma and hardship. And Charney said a loving family. a strong network of friends and positive experiences in school can help counterbalance the ill effects.With an early childhood in Haiti marked by poverty and other trauma. 19-year-old Steeve Biondolillo seems to have beat long odds.His desperate parents sent him at age 4 to an orphanage. where he lived for three years. I didn t really understand what was happening.  he recalls.  I just got thrown into a big house full of other kids.   He remembers feeling frightened and abandoned. certain he d live there forever.An American couple visited the orphanage and made plans to adopt him and a younger brother. But then came Haiti s devastating 2010 earthquake. which killed more than 100.000 and decimated Haiti s capital and nearby towns. All the hope that I had suddenly vanished.  Biondolillo said.Ultimately. the adoption went through. and the family eventually moved to Idaho. Biondolillo s new life gave him opportunities he never dreamed of. but he says he was still haunted by  the baggage and trauma that I had from Haiti. His adoptive parents got him involved in a local Boys & Girls club. a place where he and his brother could go after school just to be kids and have fun. Biondolillo says supportive adults there gave him space to talk about his life. so different from the other kids.  and helped him feel welcomed and loved.Now a college sophomore majoring in social work. he envisions a career working with the needy. helping to give back and nurture others.It has been a journey. he says. from  scared little kid to me. proud young man with big goals and a big future. ___Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

After the debate between Pennsylvania Senate candidates John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz. I felt a crushing disappointment. Rather than analysis of the positions each candidate took. article after article I read scrutinized Fetterman s oral delivery. Fetterman suffered a stroke in May and is in the process of recovering. part of what he s recovering is a more seamless ability to listen and speak with the same speed that he used to. As someone who sometimes experiences auditory processing delays and has trouble finding the right word quickly. I saw a little of myself reflected in Fetterman. This reaction from pundits and the public alike is dismal at best. and alarming at worst: These traits are not a marker of cognition. and to treat them as such reflects not only a lack of compassion. but a deep misunderstanding.I had my first experience of struggling with language three years ago. when I was 34. One October morning. I woke up on my couch surrounded by EMTs hoisting me out of my home and into an ambulance. I had just had my first seizure. They asked me a series of questions to help evaluate my state of awareness: the date. my name. my address. These were easy questions. I had no trouble coming up with the answers. The issue was being able to dig out the words for the answers. Once I figured out the right words. the next step was being able to speak them. The lag between knowing and saying was so frustrating that it upset me more than the seizure itself. After several hours at the hospital investigating my health. I was released out into the world. relieved to feel more like myself.A few weeks later. I had another seizure. which would eventually cement my epilepsy diagnosis. Much like strokes. there is a vast spectrum of the impact epilepsy can have on someone s life. In my own case. I am fortunate that very little changed with my diagnosis. except sometimes I still experience a delay in being able to process speech. I don t experience this to the degree that Fetterman does. But often a word I want will evade me as I try to catch it like a cat swatting at a string just out of reach. Recently. I was searching for a particular word. frowning as I attempted to locate it.  You know. more attention. Watched. Watched more. When you re observing something. Uh. When you re looking at with a lot of focus. Um ...   My husband gently chimed in with  supervision?  I was both relieved and exhausted. As a writer and an English professor. I have built my life around language. I have read my poetry aloud at many events. and spend hours a week speaking in front of students and parsing their questions in real time. It is both a personal and professional identity. Like Fetterman. I sometimes  mush two words together.  as he says. I will jump into a new sentence in the middle of the first one. because the better. more precise way to articulate it will suddenly surface. I cannot speak for Fetterman. but this is an incredibly vulnerable feeling to have ― knowing that I m being judged and misperceived in public on a regular basis. I am never sure if I should disclose this feature about myself. because it s not as conspicuous for me: just enough to get some smirks and raised eyebrows. or for people nearby to give each other a quick glance as if to confirm with the other that there is something  off  about me.Should I consider myself lucky that I m not forced to announce this facet of myself or my medical record in order to defend my competency? It certainly makes some things easier. In holding back how my epilepsy sometimes affects my speech and audio processing. I am just as guilty of perpetuating it as something shameful. And yet. this is not just about me ― or about Fetterman. According to the CDC. it is estimated that 3.4 million people have epilepsy in the U.S.. and that every 40 seconds someone in the U.S. has a stroke. Not everyone experiences these medical conditions in the same way. but I am willing to bet that many other conditions also impact speech and audio processing. This is a lot of people to alienate. and it s condescending to assume that none of them would be fit to serve in public office or other types of leadership roles solely because of it.As a resident of Pennsylvania. I ve been a fan of Fetterman for quite some time. long before his stroke. and well before his campaign for Senate. I am drawn to what I believe is his sincere commitment to the forgotten communities he often references. My epilepsy has made me more aware that there are many ways beyond the obvious to be forgotten. or left behind in the sense that the world moves along without knowing or understanding certain parts of you. I m not interested in telling anyone how they should cast their vote. but I will say that someone s struggles with auditory processing or speaking have nothing to do with their ability to be an incredible leader. and these prejudices should be left outside the voting booth. I am hopeful that voters and the media will take the time to pay attention. and carefully listen to what s truly at stake in this election — even if the act of listening can be hard. and can take a lot of work.Lisa Mangini is the author of five collections of poetry and short fiction.

 What happened to your face? The woman I didn t know was almost shouting. and not even trying to mask the look of pity on her face. Like most other people. she just wanted to know the story behind it all: Did I catch a rare skin disease? Did I eat something that caused such big acne bumps? Imagine answering questions about your acne everywhere you go — in the marketplace. school. streets. and church. At first. I tried to respond to the questions. telling them the pimples appeared suddenly. Initially. I would explain that I had tried using several products. but they did little to help my face. But. when they would not stop bugging me. I decided to stop responding to their questions.My face hadn t always been like this. If it had been. maybe I would have developed a thicker skin to handle all the questions. the stares I got when walking down the street. and the looks of pity. But my acne experience started suddenly. and the reactions got to me. No matter how much I tried to be strong and tell myself that I was still beautiful. it affected me deeply.Acne affects about 95% of adolescents. including many of my high school classmates. My face was smooth back then. so I never imagined I would have this experience later in life. At 15. I saw myself as one of the most beautiful girls in my class. Five years later. acne had done its worst on my self-esteem.I always thought I could handle anything life threw my way. But I wasn t ready for the damage acne did to me mentally and emotionally.The acne outbreaks started in my second year in college. At first it wasn t that bad. By my third year. it erupted to the point that I was forced to go to the hospital. The dermatologist was only available on certain days. so I had to book an appointment for the following week. Afterward. I decided to stop at the market close to my school to buy some things. It was busy as usual and people were everywhere. I thought. for once. I would get lost in the crowd without anyone noticing me or asking about my face. But I was wrong. What are you using for your face?  the first woman whose shop I entered to buy eggs asked me. I live in Nigeria. and in my country. people do not mind their business. They feel everyone s business is their business. My country is a place where a stranger would ask you why you aren t married or why you haven t started having kids yet. A place where you get unsolicited advice from not only people you know but strangers as well. Make an egg mask with baking powder and apply it to your face twice a day. I once had terrible pimples like yours some years ago.  the woman continued.  This was what I used on my face. and it worked like magic.  I thanked her and left her shop. If I had listened to the thousands of pieces of advice I have received from people on what to apply to my face. I probably would have destroyed it permanently. A woman in the same market once told me to rub my period blood on my face. an idea that instantly nauseated me. I couldn t believe how many people with no knowledge of dermatology were comfortable telling me how to treat my face. I would have preferred they didn t say anything and minded their business. Although there was another group of people who made me uncomfortable by simply staring. They wouldn t say a word. but I think I would have preferred them to talk.At my appointment with the dermatologist the following week. the doctor asked about my medical history and the medications I had taken recently. She pointed out that the prescription corticosteroid I took when I traveled home for vacation could have triggered the breakouts.The dermatologist prescribed me some facial wash. medications. and topical creams. I was to use a salicylic acid face wash. a topical cream that contains benzoyl peroxide. and a retinol gel. I also took doxycycline medication. I hoped the medications would work immediately. but I had to wait a while and use it for some time before noticing some changes. Despite how bad it was. I had to force myself to leave my room. go to school. and carry on with my everyday life. One day. I visited my friend. who told me I was strong.  If I were in your shoes. I wouldn t be able to bring myself to leave my room.  she said. How do you deal with all the questions and stares?  she asked.  I survive.  I replied. laughing it off. I didn t tell her the type of willpower it took me to leave my room each day. I didn t tell her that on some days. I cried when I looked in the mirror.Luckily. I had supportive friends who helped me feel better about myself. I would watch movies or read books to distract myself. Taking a walk to clear my head during the evening when no one would notice my face also helped. The medications the dermatologist prescribed eventually worked. It didn t clear everything. but it helped a lot. especially with kick-starting the healing process. I later had to find other products to help smooth out the scars that the pimples left behind. But not before all of this did a number on my self-esteem.Recently. I asked Angela Karanja. a psychologist. author. empowerment coach. mentor. and founder of Raising Remarkable Teenagers. about how to deal with the negative feelings that come with acne.  The first step is the awareness stage.  Karanja said.  Learning to assure ourselves that we are OK and that our human worth is not tied to having or not having a clear face. We are more than a face — way more than a face. You may not understand it until you have experienced it. But skin conditions like acne can tank your self-esteem. even causing you to slip into depression. I had to constantly try to remind myself that even with the pimples. my beauty was still intact — maybe hidden. but not lost. And then and now. I am more than just a face.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we re looking for here and send us a pitch.,Health News
with wheezing babiesThe preliminary results buoy hope that after decades of failure and frustration. vaccines against RSV may finally be getting close.Pfizer announced Tuesday that a large international study found vaccinating moms-to-be was nearly 82% effective at preventing severe cases of RSV in their babies  most vulnerable first 90 days of life. At age 6 months. the vaccine still was proving 69% effective against serious illness — and there were no signs of safety problems in mothers or babies. Moms are always giving their antibodies to their baby.  said virologist Kena Swanson. Pfizer s vice president of viral vaccines.  The vaccine just puts them in that much better position  to form and pass on RSV-fighting antibodies.The vaccine quest isn t just to protect infants. RSV is dangerous for older adults. too. and both Pfizer and rival GSK recently announced that their competing shots also proved protective for seniors.None of the findings will help this year when an early RSV surge already is crowding children s hospitals. But they raise the prospect that one or more vaccines might become available before next fall s RSV season. My fingers are crossed.  said Dr. William Schaffner. an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.  We re making inroads. Tuesday s data was reported in a press release and hasn t been vetted by independent experts.Here s a look at the long quest for RSV vaccines.For most healthy people. RSV. or respiratory syncytial virus. is a cold-like nuisance. But for the very young. the elderly and people with certain health problems. it can be serious. even life-threatening. The virus can infect deep in the lungs. causing pneumonia. and in babies it can impede breathing by inflaming tiny airways.In the U.S.. about 58.000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized for RSV each year and several hundred die. Among adults 65 and older. about 177.000 are hospitalized with RSV and 14.000 die annually.Worldwide. RSV kills about 100.000 children a year. mostly in poor countries.A tragedy in the 1960s set back the whole field. Using the approach that led to the first polio vaccine. scientists made an experimental RSV vaccine by growing the virus in a lab and killing it. But testing in children found not only was the vaccine not protective. youngsters who caught RSV after vaccination fared worse. Two died. For a period of 20 years. even though science was advancing. nobody wanted to go near development of an RSV vaccine.  Schaffner said.Even today s modern RSV vaccine candidates were tested first in older adults. not children. he noted.Modern vaccines tend to target the outer surface of a virus. what the immune system sees when a germ invades. For RSV. that target is the so-called F protein that helps the virus latch onto human cells. Again there was a hurdle: That protein is a shape-shifter. rearranging its form before and after it  fuses  to cells.It turns out that the immune system only forms effective RSV-fighting antibodies when it spots what s called the pre-fusion version of that protein. explained structural biologist Jason McLellan of the University of Texas at Austin.In 2013. McLellan and virologist Barney Graham were working at the National Institutes of Health when they homed in on the correct shape and figured out how to freeze it in that form. That finding opened the way to today s development of a variety of experimental RSV vaccine candidates.(That same discovery was key to the hugely successful COVID-19 vaccines. as the coronavirus also is cloaked in a shape-shifting surface protein.)Several companies are creating RSV vaccines but Pfizer and rival GSK are furthest along. Both companies recently reported final-stage testing in older adults. The competing vaccines are made somewhat differently but each proved strongly effective. especially against serious disease. Both companies plan to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. by the end of the year. as well as in other countries.The older-adult data  looks fantastic.  said McLellan. who has closely followed the vaccine development.  I think we re on the right track. And if vaccinating pregnant women pans out. it could be  a win for two individuals instead of just one.  by offering protection to both mom-to-be and baby. said Dr. Wilbur Chen of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.Pfizer s maternal vaccine is the same recipe that it tested successfully in older adults — and it also plans to seek Food and Drug Administration approval for those vaccinations by year s end.The new study included 7.400 pregnant women in 18 countries. including the U.S.. and spanned multiple RSV seasons. Preliminary results reported Tuesday show the vaccine was most effective against severe disease. For milder illness. effectiveness was 51% to 57% ― short of the study s statistical requirements but a result that Pfizer still called clinically meaningful because it could mean fewer trips to the doctor s office.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Menstrual cramps can be annoying. plan-canceling and downright debilitating. And after years of dealing with them. you re probably pretty used to reaching for pain relievers to help minimize your symptoms.While pain relievers are great and sometimes necessary. experts say there are ways to relieve your cramps naturally. and balance your body in a way that (hopefully) means those cramps won t come back next month. This. experts say. can be done with food and drinks that are probably already in your fridge.Excess estrogenLeslie Northcutt28Dr. Gloria BachmannBut Bachmann and Sannoh emphasized that this is an area of growing research. so more exploration needs to be done to find the exact relationship between food. when that food is eaten during a menstrual cycle. and menstrual pain intensity.Bachmann and Sannoh noted that in addition to thinking about what you eat during your period. it s important to think about the entire menstrual cycle. because different nutrients are needed during different phases of your cycle.Here s how you should be eating to help minimize cramps.day 14 of a 28-day cycleHigh-fiber foodsFoods that contain high amounts of fiber help with constipation. which tends to occur during the luteal phase of your cycle because of an increase in the hormone progesterone. Northcutt said. And when you aren t eliminating properly. hormones and toxins that your body wants to push out can build up and get reabsorbed instead. In the case of periods. when estrogen builds up instead of getting pushed out. you can experience estrogen dominance. which can cause painful period cramps and heavy bleeding. she said. So. making sure you eat high-fiber foods in the weeks before your period can potentially help any painful cramps that normally accompany your period.  Magnesium tends to be helpful because it s a natural muscle relaxer.  said Isabel Smith. a registered dietitian and CEO of Isabel Smith Nutrition. When it comes to your period. magnesium will help relax the uterine muscles. which in turn can help alleviate cramps. You can find magnesium in green veggie juices. which will also help with hydration. Smith said. according to the National Institutes of Health These during your period are especially effective for cramps because magnesium actually acts on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors in your brain.  Northcutt said.  What happens is magnesium will block prostaglandins. which are responsible for the pain associated with cramps. The pain relief that comes with magnesium-rich foods means you ll want to eat them when you begin menstruating.researchingdecreasing the intake of pro-inflammatory foods and increasing the intake of anti-inflammatory foods may help lessen menstrual pain. commonly found in seafood. seeds and nutsSpecifically. you can find omega-3 fatty acids in salmon. flaxseeds. sardines and nuts. they said. They re also present in walnuts. seaweed. mackerel. oysters and hemp seeds. Studies suggest that people observing [a plant-based] type of diet have lower rates of inflammation. and. with lower rates of inflammation there will probably be less intense menstrual pain.  Bachmann and Sannoh said.That said. a plant-based diet. which cuts out all animal products and animal byproducts. can be a hard switch for many people. If that s the case for you. that s OK.Certain foods act as aromatase inhibitors. which means they block excess estrogen. Northcutt said. Estrogen dominance is a top culprit of PMS.  she said.  Excess estrogen can increase your inflammatory response and also make you more susceptible to pain. Foods like citrus fruits. spinach. mushrooms. beef liver. dark chocolate and cacao powder all help lower the level of estrogen in the body. which can help your periods be less painful. Smith said it s important to focus on hydration all throughout the month. but especially during and around your period. This is because water is a  natural muscle relaxer. so [it s] helpful for cramping.  she said.lead to muscle crampsIt s best to stick to non-sugary drinks for hydration. since sugar can lead to dehydration. Smith noted. Omega-6 fatty acids are popularly known as pro-inflammatory and these foods have been associated with triggering painful menstruation.  Bachmann and Sannoh said.Omega-6 fatty acids are commonly found in red meats and processed foods like french fries. Research overall suggests that consuming diets high in omega-6 fatty acids increases the presence of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. which may lead to increased menstrual cramping.  Bachmann and Sannoh said.But omega-6 fatty acids should not be avoided at all times. because a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is necessary for our bodies. they noted.It may feel overwhelming to have to alter your entire diet to (hopefully) have less painful menstrual cramps. but you can try out aspects that work for your lifestyle. Balance is best.  Northcutt said.  Everyone knows if you want to be healthy you have to work out [and] eat clean. but it s good to have little tips and tricks on how to live a balanced life. No one s perfect. This can mean. say. focusing on hydration and fiber-rich foods in the days before your period. or reaching for some anti-inflammatory dinner ingredients during your period. You can still have whatever you re craving. too: Just try to balance it with some ingredients that help alleviate your cramps.,Health News

If you ve ever had a facial. you re probably familiar with the aesthetician massaging the outside of your cheeks. But have you ever had them massage the inside of your cheeks? It sounds strange. but that s what a buccal facial massage is all about.While these massages have been around for some time. social media and TikTok especially have brought this unusual practice back into the spotlight. Buccal face massage is a technique that involves massaging the face from inside of the mouth. stretching the cheeks and accessing deeper muscles.  said Dr. Jaimie DeRosa. a plastic surgeon and the founder of DeRosa Center Plastic Surgery and Med Spa  One thing to know is that it can be uncomfortable. and some people actually say that it s quite painful. So why is anyone paying for this awkward experience? Because of all the alleged benefits. which vary depending on who you ask. Some salons advertise cosmetic improvements. saying this expert massage can sculpt the muscles of your face. tone your jawline and contour your cheeks. Others claim it can train your muscles to lie in a certain way. lifting them and decreasing your skin s sagginess.Since the massage technique targets areas of the lymphatic system. it is said to encourage fluid drainage and in turn reduce puffiness or even decrease dark under-eye circles. But science around the lymphatic system is still emerging. and these purported benefits are questionable. While lymphatic massage may be helpful for lymphedema and breast cancer-related lymphedema patients in particular. there is almost zero research to support the claims that otherwise healthy individuals can benefit.But your appearance isn t all that these buccal massages purportedly improve. Stressed out and clenching your teeth? Dealing with temporomandibular joint disorders (also known as TMJ)? Having headaches from all the tension in your jawline? A buccal massage can supposedly treat these ailments as well. These benefits sound great. but they also sound a bit too good to be true. So will you actually see an improvement after having your inner cheeks massaged? I think it depends on what type of results the patient is seeking.  said Dr. Gary Motykie. a celebrity plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. California.  If they re seeking facial contour. they may temporarily achieve that.  For permanent facial sculpting. or at least longer-lasting results. injections and surgeries may be a better use of your money. However. the outcomes of a buccal massage may be more promising for those dealing with tight muscles in areas of the face. I believe that buccal massages can indeed help jaw tension.  said Dr. Oren Tepper. a plastic surgeon and co-founder of New York s Tribeca Institute of Plastic Surgery.  In fact. many people with jaw tension have enlargement of the muscles (hypertrophy) due to clenching and repetitive movements.  Frequent massage of these jaw muscles could help relax and potentially shrink them over time. While there are no studies supporting this treatment for tight muscles. some people with TMJ and headaches say they rely on the technique for relief. If you re dealing with jaw tightness but uncomfortable with visiting a local medispa. you can try this massage at home. After washing your hands. simply slide your index fingers inside each cheek. slowly massaging and stretching. Start at the lips before moving to the cheeks and then back toward the jaw muscles.If this doesn t relieve your muscle tightness. a medispa may still be able to help. as jawline tension can be reduced by using Botox in the masseter muscles. which lower the jaw open.While the experts weren t sold on all the benefits of buccal massage. there were no major concerns. either. But DeRosa. the Boston plastic surgeon. did have one thought you may not have considered:  I always wince to see how the cheek is stretched with buccal face massage ― wondering if this may actually pull the skin loose and actually advance facial aging more quickly. Regardless. a buccal facial massage won t hurt you. Sticking with your standard facials is a safe bet if you want improved skin appearance. For those who have jaw tension. it s a good first step before trying more serious treatments. ,Health News
From a young age we re told to stand up straight. Many people probably even have memories of walking around the house with a book on their head to help improve their posture (I know I do).But why is it even important to do this? What exactly does  good posture  mean for you health-wise anyway? It may be a little aesthetic — we re taught that models with perfect posture are what we should aim to resemble — and it has some science-backed perks. But. based on the years of posture reminders and even at-school posture checks. there are probably fewer benefits than you thought.Here. experts weigh in on posture and whether having good posture is truly beneficial for your health or total B.S.Dr. Scott Mallozzi Dr. Mark Queralt. To have that person sit straight and arch their back all day long would be painful.  Queralt said. So. what is good posture for one person may not be possible for another. age-related change is part of life. Queralt explained. It s natural for your spine to evolve and require different postures throughout your life.   What would you think your spine is going to look like at 60? Would you expect it to look like you re 30 or would you expect changes?  Queralt asked. Good posture for you may shift. and that s totally normal.The answer to this differs.Dr. Amit JainAccording to the National Institutes of HealthWhile good posture doesn t necessarily mean you won t develop back issues one day. having good spinal strength could help you better manage if you do have to deal with these conditions in the future. Mallozzi added. Your muscles will have to work harder if your posture results in an uneven distribution of weight or an unfair strain on your body.For example. people who droop their necks to look at their phones or other handheld devices often suffer from  text neck.  which creates additional strain on the body.told HealthlineBut standing up straight may not fix any health problems. either. It also won t necessarily save you from any existing back issues.ere is very little. if any. evidence to support posture and either reduction in current pain or prevention of future pain.  Queralt said.pointed to a studyInstead of constantly reminding yourself to stand up straight. you may want to focus on strengthening specific muscle groups. By working out. you re allowing these muscles to better support your spine and help your body comfortably stand up straight without forcing it or making you feel uncomfortable. There are two muscle groups that work well to help you with posture.  Mallozzi said. The first group is your paraspinal muscles. which are the muscles that surround your spine from your neck to your lower back. If you have a strong group of muscles around your spine. your discs and joints will have to do less work because they re better supported. he said. The other muscle group that s important to work is your core. which will further help support your back.strength exercisesbridgesshoulder-blade squeezesThese exercises  really do help people achieve this musculature that is supportive of good posture.  Mallozzi said.He added that some factors that impact posture can t be corrected with exercise. Issues like arthritis or stiffness of the hips won t just go away. but if you start prioritizing strength exercise early in life. you ll be more set up for success.  The more you have [of] that good base to start. the more you ll be able to compensate if you do develop other issues.  Mallozzi said. We know exercise is good for cardiovascular health — it s good for osteoporosis prevention. and people who exercise tend to have better mental health scores.  Queralt said. Instead of focusing so much on standing up straight or sitting up straight. it s more important to incorporate different movements into your day.  We think the fluidity of not being in the same static movement — sitting all day or standing all day  is important. Queralt said.It doesn t really matter if you sit up straight in these positions or slump in these positions. just being in one static position for eight hours a day is not ideal. he added. For example. you ll get tight from sitting all day in front of your laptop. and you ll likely be hunched forward with your neck poking forward while doing so. Jain recommended taking scheduled breaks from sitting at work or adding a standing desk to your at-home work setup. Ultimately. while sitting or standing up straight may feel right for you. it doesn t feel right for everyone ― and that s OK. Good posture has debated benefits. including pain reduction and less strain on surrounding muscles. the pressure people get from family members about their posture is probably a little exaggerated.Hunching over in high school doesn t mean you ll have a hunched back for the rest of your life. but prioritizing good muscle strength through fitness and movement can help relieve some of the pressure that s put on our spine every day.,Health News
I have months to live. perhaps two. perhaps some other number. the doctors won t tell me. They can t. They do not know. Instead. they talk about  response to treatment.  clinical trials. science with an aperture of hope.Some days hope feels puerile and unproductive. unmatched by the reality of this brain tumor. which formed in my left parietal lobe. expanded to my cerebellum. and is currently spreading down my spine. It is a base and primal thing. unaware. or unconcerned. that it is draining my capacity to remember names and places. follow recipes. descend an unrailed staircase. walk in a straight line ― that it will kill me.Forty-four feels horribly young for a terminal diagnosis in an otherwise healthy. active body. and for glioblastoma. in particular. the cancer of Ted Kennedy and John McCain. old men in the sunset of life. It has been a long time since I have been considered young in a medical capacity ― me of the  geriatric  pregnancies. But here I am. young and old. losing my life minute by minute and my memory even faster. In many ways. over many years. I have trained myself to forget the present as it occurs. or not let it register in the first place. This began in fifth grade ― the year my dad departed under the guise of temporary separation. taking the necessary steps to launch his academic career in California.My brothers. sister and I slowly woke to the fact that we would never again all live under the same roof. We stayed put in Ithaca. the place my dad had uprooted us to in pursuit of that critical. door-opening. life-altering Ph.D. With the pursuit over. the objective achieved. he was off and I was stranded in the same split-level house we had helped scrub the pet stench from three years earlier.  Don t worry. this is temporary.  my dad had promised 7-year-old me. For him. yes. but I lived there until the summer before I left for college.I learned to live outside my body ― or perhaps deep within it ― willing myself inaccessible. unmoved. The summer before high school. I lived with my dad. Left to my own devices. I explored the woods and set off on runs along busy roads. Ordering my head steady. my eyes dry. I pretended not to wince at the catcalls or startle at the car horns from men who tried to get my attention. I cultivated detachment as a skill ― a shield against pain. discomfort. exposure ― muting even the sound of my own name yelled down a hallway.  I called to you after fifth period. but you didn t even look up.  my sister exclaimed. I had no recollection of it. I was pulled too tightly into myself. closed off. shut down. unable to decipher what exactly the world thought I offered and to whom.This separation continued. driven by habit. not desire. I remember stumbling upon a late-night study group on a Saturday night in college. Surprised by the interruption but unconcerned. their focus already extended deep and wide as they raised new questions. consulted additional texts. rubbed their temples. shrugged. laughed. I remember wishing I could stay there with them and just listen to what they said in the night. Instead. I lurched back outside. toward the noise. the sticky floors and plastic cups of fraternity basements. the sense that I was a walking shadow. putting one foot in front of the other without desire or destination.I spent another decade feeling divided and incomplete within myself without making any significant changes to remedy that. In my early 30s. I moved to Florida to run an office transition. despite wanting to stay in New York and change careers. Isolated and adrift. I played the part of competent manager during the day. while at night I lay awake wondering how I had gotten so off track. I drank to excess and was pulled over for erratic driving. I thought this would undo me. instead. it forced me to confront and rebuild.I joined women s groups and built critical friendships. I learned to tell the truth about who I am and what I need. I switched jobs. then careers. I stopped believing there was something fundamentally broken inside me that could not be fixed. I settled in Brooklyn. I married the man I had fallen in love with years earlier when celebrating my 25th birthday at an Irish pub in Manhattan. I learned to give honest answers to essential questions. such as.  How are you?   What are you thinking?   How can I help?  I gave birth to two children who fill my life with joy and love I never let myself hope to have. We built a family. And then. last December. I lost the ability to write. I showed my husband my spelling errors and nonsensical scribble on our holiday cards.  I don t know what s happening to me.  I sobbed. The next day in the ER. we learned I had a mass in my brain. It took another two months to learn the diagnosis of glioblastoma. longer still to understand just how powerful and unrelenting these tumors are ― mine no exception. Suddenly. this body that once ran marathons and traveled the world could no longer be trusted to carry my daughter into school in the morning or up the stairs to bed. Now. we are told I may have just months to live. It is devastating in so many ways. There are so many things I still want to do ― hike Mount Kilimanjaro. speak fluent French. so many things I thought I would be ― a novelist. a grandmother. So many of life s moments ― First Communions. sleepaway camps. travels abroad ― I thought I d prepare my children for and help usher them through. But I can t. Not with any certainty.Yet. I accept the terms because it means I get to be here with them ― my beautiful family ― a little bit longer. I get to be with them in the world. I get to be alive in the world.And that is what I have finally internalized ― the incredible gift of this life s journey. and the ability to be fully present within it. living. loving. hurting. grieving. discovering. Being. Because even though life can be hard and cruel and painful. it is still incredible. And we get to experience it. We get to live it. We get to be in the middle of it. Yes. it often takes something profoundly difficult. something life-altering. to see this clearly. but what a thing to see and to know for sure. I will continue to wish for the nearly impossible ― a cure. a breakthrough. a decade ― but plan for and prepare my children for the increasingly inevitable ― the loss of me. I will live with an eye toward what is next ― for them. for all of us ― and ensure I embody the lessons I hope they will carry within them.What I hope for them ― what I wish to convey to them and want anyone reading this to consider ― is this: cultivate the courage and ability to be fully present in your life. the joy and the pain. Let the hurt and disappointment ― even rage ― of my decline and death and all of life s heartbreaks and struggles strengthen you and open you up. rather than shut you down. Gravitate toward connection over isolation. Find those lit rooms of earnest conversation in the night. Explore your evolving truths about who you are and what you want and what you need. Don t let decades pass only to realize you haven t been fully present and you don t remember who you have touched or loved.

The unfortunate reality for marginalized communities is that discrimination is hardly ever a surprise. It can be disappointing. scary and infuriating. but it s rarely shocking.in the recent case of Kanye WestAnd while it s never a surprise to deal with discrimination. it s always harmful to experience. And that harm goes further than you probably think.Discrimination has major and lasting effects. whether it arrives in the form of big things like being denied proper health care or seemingly smaller things like microaggressions.Chanel MeyersAnd those consequences don t end with your mental health. As Meyers notes. there are also negative physical health outcomes related to experiencing discrimination.Here. experts explain what discrimination does to your body and mind.According to Jared Montoya. a professor in the School of Business and Leadership at Our Lady of the Lake University in Texas.  individuals who are victims of discrimination tend to have heightened levels of stress.  where the discrimination is ongoing.Ongoing discrimination can refer to a few different things. It can mean constant exposure to discriminatory events. but it can also take the form of discrimination that happens on a recurring basis throughout someone s life. We create a particular response mechanism to different instances.  Montoya said. For people who have dealt with discrimination at different points in their life.  when they find themselves in a similar situation again. much of [those response mechanisms] resurface.  On top of that. those kinds of similar situations will likely trigger whatever stress or trauma a person might be holding on to from any past discriminatory encounters.  It s almost like they re experiencing it again. plus whatever is being added on to that.  Montoya said.plenty of researchIt can be hard to feel your best when you re forced to deal with prejudice and bias again and again throughout your life.Carly Coonsworks to address mental illnessSafety is a basic human need. and without it. it s impossible to thrive and even tough to simply survive. If you experience ongoing discrimination. your safety is pulled away from you. often with no warning. A society should be a place where people feel safe to be themselves.  Coons said.If you lose that safety after experiencing a discriminatory event or learning that your community is being targeted. it becomes challenging to regain that safety and maintain it. Folks have to constantly observe their surroundings and decide if they feel safe being themselves in certain spaces. Coons said. And that gets in the way of connecting and engaging with the world around you. That s the thing about discrimination and about antisemitism ― it s meant to attack us as individuals and make us not feel as if we re enough. which we are. but it becomes very isolating.  she said.Meyers said that people who continuously experience discrimination can develop trauma responses as a result.racial traumapost-traumatic stress disorder We think of trauma as something really exaggerated. but just forms of discrimination if you re repeatedly experiencing them is a form of trauma.  she said. Trauma doesn t have to come from a huge display of discrimination. either: It can be caused by something as seemingly small as a friend or family member invalidating a racist experience. When your body is stressed. you may have trouble sleeping. which can affect your productivity at work and your ability to connect with loved ones.A 2017 study foundSo. the stress that comes from antisemitism. racism or other forms of discrimination can actually make you more likely to get physically sick.To deal with the flurry of negative emotions that accompany discrimination. people often become withdrawn. Montoya said. They ll avoid particular places or situations that could trigger them or that could result in a discriminatory event. Because of this.  they may not have that social experience that is part of our general well-being.  he said. And connection and belongingness are crucial to our fundamental needs.Discrimination makes people feel  othered  or not part of the  in-group.  Montoya said. This makes people turn inward. whether consciously or unconsciously. and it creates a vicious cycle — you re withdrawn. you re not engaging with the group. and then the group sees you as withdrawn. so they don t invite you in.It s a cycle that almost creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Montoya noted.Discrimination is scary and angering. and it can feel never-ending. If you re part of a group that deals with discrimination. it s important to take care of yourself. On some level. this is an unfair thing to ask of people. Meyers noted.  It s a hard thing to even talk about. because you re basically telling victims of discrimination to do something about it. which they shouldn t have to. right?  she said.  The problem is not with them.  don t There is a reason why we should confront discrimination. there is a reason why we need to see [fewer] instances of this.  Meyers said.  It s because of norm-setting in society — that really guides so much of our behavior. We see what other people do and we take that information as ‘OK. this is acceptable.  If people confront and shut down discrimination. it ll help solidify the understanding in society that this behavior is not OK.  I think that is the key way we turn the needle on prejudice in our society.  Meyers said.Montoya said we need to be constantly vigilant in calling out discrimination and racism. no matter who it s affecting in a given moment. We don t need to wait for these cycles to occur.  Montoya said. adding that there will always be someone stirring the pot because we live in a climate that allows for this behavior. The only way that can change is by society pushing back. If we re not vigilant. then we re going to have these [discriminatory] instances again and again.  Montoya said — as we have since the beginning of time.,Health News
Long days on the computer. pollen-filled air or just a repetitive habit? Whatever the reason. many of us are rubbing our eyes too much. and experts say it s not a good idea. Tara Adashev Dr. Nava Greenfield Dr. Karyn GrossmanA person s allergies can sometimes be the culprit. too.  Allergies can also cause itchy eyes. which causes people to rub. which then causes more itching.  Grossman said.If the itchiness is driving you crazy. Greenfield suggested a medical consultation.  Sometimes a topical steroid is needed to reduce the sensation of itch. which prevents the need or impulse to scratch.  Greenfield said.  Other times. antihistamines can be used to control the itch. Dermatologists suggest keeping your hands away from your eyes because an eye-rubbing habit can seriously affect your appearance and your health. The habit could have consequences such as:Bloodshot eyes Dr. Snehal AminDark circlesdark circles under the eyes Dr. Angelo ThrowerWrinkles Dr. Brendan CampCorneal damage Chronic rubbing not only damages the skin of the eyelid but also can cause micro scratches to the cornea.  Amin said.  Over time. this can result in thinning and loss of shape of the cornea. which can lead to blurry vision. a condition known as keratoconus. Eye rubbing is especially dangerous for people with underlying glaucoma. as it can cause spikes in intraocular pressure. Infection risk The eyes are a portal for infection.  Amin said.  Germs from the hands or air can enter the body through the mucosa of the eyes. a concern that s been highlighted during the pandemic. Take your dermatologist s advice for applying skin and beauty products correctly.  The effects on the skin of patting. dabbing and rubbing are very different and impact the way the product will be absorbed by the skin layers.  Thrower said.  It also makes a big difference whether the skin is dry or wet when applying a product. Here s some good news: A couple of your eye-related habits might not be as bad as you might have thought. Dr. Tanuj Nakra. the ophthalmic plastic surgeon. dermatologist and co-founder of Avya Skincare. said.  Light pulling on the eyes to apply makeup or insert contact lenses is not likely to cause negative effects. And while wearing swim goggles can cause temporary swelling and redness around the eyes. that s not a permanent condition. If you realize you ve been rubbing your eyes more than usual. here are some expert habit-breaking tips:The experts suggested these products to help you with itchiness:The good news is that there s always time to put an end to this particular bad habit.  The effects of chronic eye rubbing are seen over a long period of time and may not be noticed immediately.  Greenfield said.  But breaking the habit is important for the long-term health and appearance of your skin.  ,Health News
This post discusses plot details from the season finale of  House of the Dragon. After putting our small children to bed Sunday night. my husband and I made an ill-fated decision to watch the season finale of HBO s  House of the Dragon.  After tuning in for the last nine weeks and being a bit annoyed here and there with the show s clear striving for  shock value.  I finally reached my limit this week. The final episode of this season begins with Rhaenyra finding out about her father s death and her brother s subsequent ascension to the throne. The problem? She is her father s named heir. The news sends her into premature labor — she has pains. is heavily bleeding. and her water breaks. What follows is perhaps the most offensive scene of birth trauma and death in the show. It s one thing to watch. as we did in the first episode. a forced C-section (which was admittedly difficult. as someone who has had an emergency C-section). It s another to watch a mother be burned alive during childbirth. as we did in Episode 6. It s entirely something else to watch. in graphic detail. a dead baby flop on the floor. their mother desperately grasping. clinging and hoping that breath will fill his or her lungs. When this experience has been your reality. watching it unfold on television without any sort of trigger warning is excruciating. My baby girl. my third child. was born last November after I had a nine-week hospital stay that culminated in premature labor and an emergency C-section. I don t remember the moment she was born. I didn t hear her first cries. The epidural wasn t working fast enough. and because she was breech and I was six centimeters dilated already. I was hastily placed under general anesthesia.  Are you sure you did it right?!  I heard the residents arguing with each other. One of them grabbed my arm. and everything went black. I didn t know then that I would never get to hear her cry. She was immediately whisked away to the NICU — while I was still unconscious — and placed on a ventilator. She died the next day. I ll never see her walk. I ll never see her graduate kindergarten. get married or have children of her own. I never even got to see the color of her eyes. After my first child was born. I remember telling my pregnant friends that the greatest feeling in the world is having your newborn placed on your chest. But there are no words to describe this same scenario when you know the only reason the medical team is even letting you touch your baby is that there is nothing left to do to save her.The machines aren t working anymore. She is slipping away. She will not come home with you. I am only thankful that my husband and I were there when it happened so we could hold her. tell her how much we loved her and say goodbye. The opening scene of the finale with Rhaenyra s baby must be shocking even to viewers who haven t been in that position. But if the unimaginable has happened to you. watching a tasteless portrayal of it in a show that s centered around dragons — yes. dragons — is a total gut punch. It takes your breath away. It takes you right back to the day your child died. This is why a trigger warning would have been helpful. If a trigger warning can apply to suicide. sexual assault and eating disorders. why can t it apply to birth trauma and the death of an infant? A trigger warning gives the viewer a heads-up. so to speak. and the choice of whether to watch or not. Since that scene came out of nowhere. with no trigger warning. and with no real value to the plot. viewers like me were taken by surprise. (Thankfully. I watched the season premiere a day late. so I already knew about the forced C-section before watching that episode. I left the room for part of it). In a society that is so uncomfortable with grief in general. and even more so when that grief comes from losing a child. the callous way this show has handled infant and maternal death is appalling.Not only did the graphic details feel egregious and sensational. but the portrayal felt unrealistic. For instance. Rhaenyra seems barely scathed after her child s death because she knows she must do her duty and consider battle and her claim to the throne. She s even crowned during her child s funeral. Yeah. right. I don t care what your sense of duty is — if your baby has just died. you re not immediately plotting your next move toward the throne. Or toward anything. for that matter. You re holding them for as long as you can — it s the only time you ll ever have on this earth. And for me. weeks later. getting out of bed in the morning was still a small feat. Eleven months out. I still have days when getting out of bed seems like too much to ask.  House of the Dragon  showrunners claimed in August that their new show would portray less sexual violence than its predecessor.  Game of Thrones. Ryan Condal said.  The particular way that we ve approached it in this time is making sure that whenever you re going to have any kind of ... sex or violence on screen. that there s a compelling story reason for it. and that it s a story that needs to be told. It s not being done gratuitously or to titillate or anything like that.  This statement now seems laughable. Did that scene really propel the show s narrative in a meaningful way? This show has simply replaced gratuitous sexual violence with gratuitous birth trauma. exchanging one type of horror some women experience for another. Some might argue that at the end of the day. this is a fantasy show. and it doesn t really matter how these issues are portrayed. I would say that it absolutely does. The media we consume shapes our attitudes. It also reflects our values. So. what does it say about us when we venerate TV shows that fetishize women s birth trauma and suffering? Especially given our current political climate. this type of content is irresponsible.So I ll say this: Shame on you. HBO. Shame on you for not including an easy and obvious trigger warning. Shame on you for your false pretenses that this show would be less gratuitous in depicting violence inflicted on women. Shame on you for the way you portray women s lives and our complex emotions and experiences. To quote that other dragon show of yours: Shame. shame. shame.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

A judge on Monday ruled a group of public New York City employees who were fired after failing to comply with the city s vaccination requirements should be reinstated in their positions and receive back pay. In October 2021. Dave Chokshi. who was New York City health commissioner at the time. issued a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for city employees. saying those who wouldn t comply shouldn t be allowed into their workplace.Mayor Eric Adams announcedThe 16 former employees of the city s Department of Sanitation who were laid off in February 2022 argued Adams  exemption announcement rendered the public employee vaccination mandate  arbitrary and capricious. Ralph J. Porzio agreed The vaccination mandate for city employees was not just about safety and public health. it was about compliance.  Porzio wrote.Porzio said if the order was motivated by safeguarding public health it would apply to all workers in the city. In a city with nearly 80% vaccination rate. we shouldn t be penalizing the people who showed up to work. at great risk to themselves and their families. while we were locked down.  the judge said.The city has appealed Porzio s decision.according to WABC-TVtold City & StateexpirePorzio added that Chokshi overstepped his authority in making decisions in regard to the employment of city employees. noting the commissioner doesn t have the power to terminate employees or exempt others from the rules.The judge also discussed the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines at preventing infection to justify his verdict — noting that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can contract COVID — despite arguing his decision was not intended to opine on vaccination but instead address how those who worked through the pandemic are treated. The petitioners should not have been terminated for choosing not to protect themselves.  Porzio wrote.  We have learned through the course of the pandemic that the vaccine against COVID-19 is not absolute. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. though. has continued to emphasize the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in protecting individuals  against severe disease. hospitalization. and death in adults. including during omicron variant predominance. agency saysJoe Bidenvaccinated,Health News
BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese city of Shanghai started administering an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday in what appears to be a world first.The vaccine. a mist that is sucked in through the mouth. is being offered for free as a booster dose for previously vaccinated individuals. according to an announcement posted on an official city social media account.Needle-free vaccines may persuade people who don t like getting a shot to get vaccinated. as well as help expand vaccination in poor countries because they are easier to administer.China doesn t have vaccine mandates but wants more people to get booster shots before it relaxes strict pandemic restrictions that are holding back the economy and increasingly out of synch with the rest of the world.video posted It was like drinking a cup of milk tea.  one Shanghai resident said in the video.  When I breathed it in. it tasted a bit sweet. A vaccine taken in the mouth could also fend off the virus before it reaches the rest of the respiratory system. though that would depend in part on the size of the droplets. one expert said.Larger droplets would train defenses in parts of the mouth and throat. while smaller ones would travel further into the body. said Dr. Vineeta Bal. an immunologist in India.Chinese regulators approved the vaccine for use as a booster in September. It was developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company Cansino Biologics Inc. as an aerosol version of the same company s one-shot adenovirus vaccine. which uses a relatively harmless cold virus.Cansino has said the inhaled vaccine has completed clinical trials in China. Hungary. Pakistan. Malaysia. Argentina and Mexico.Regulators in India have approved a nasal vaccine. another needle-free approach. but it has yet to be rolled out. The vaccine. developed in the U.S. and licensed to Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech. is squirted in the nose.About a dozen nasal vaccines are being tested globally. according to the World Health Organization.___Associated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi and video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.,Health News
President Joe Biden received the updated COVID-19 vaccine live on television Tuesday. urging Americans to protect themselves against the virus ahead of the anticipated winter surge but stopping short of encouraging mask-wearing.Biden received the latest vaccine targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the omicron strain. the current versions of COVID-19 that are most prevalent in the country and globally. Public health officials in the U.S. recommend people over the age of 5 get the updated vaccine once a year —  with the exception that the elderly and immunocompromised may need more than one shot annually. Get vaccinated. Update your COVID vaccine. It s incredibly effective. but the truth is not enough people are getting it. We ve got to change that so we can all have a safe and healthy holiday season.  the president said in a speech.  That s why I m getting my shot updated today. The bivalent COVID-19 boosters became available on Sept. 2. and people can find a location to get vaccinated on vaccines.gov. The vaccine helps those who can get it have the best protection against serious illness and death from the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the omicron subvariants. Biden said that people who refuse to get vaccinated even though they can are putting themselves and others at risk. especially right before the season that historically has more flu and COVID-19 cases. New variants have emerged here in the U.S. and around the world. We ve seen cases of hospitalizations rise in Europe in recent weeks. and the weather is getting colder. People will spend more time indoors and contagious viruses like COVID are going to spread considerably more easily.  the president said.  As a country. we have a choice to make.  he continued.  Can we repeat what happened in the past winters? More infections. more hospitalizations. more loved ones getting sick. even dying from the virus? Or can we have a much better winter. if we use all the tools we have available to us now? While the vaccine protects against hospitalization and death. people can still contract the virus — especially if they do not implement other mitigating measures like wearing a mask indoors and in crowds. and avoiding close contact with those who are infected or exposed. Biden encouraged people who are symptomatic or feel they ve been exposed to get tested for COVID-19. and to receive treatment if they test positive.Notably. the president did not once mention in his speech the idea of wearing masks ahead of the winter surge. Masks are important for preventing transmission. and can help disabled people safely move around in public knowing they are better protected from others. Over the course of this year. the country has lifted mask mandates in indoor public settings that would have allowed disabled people to participate in society.The vaccine also does not necessarily prevent long COVID. a major health problem resulting from infection that disables a person due to a list of long-lasting symptoms ranging from fatigue. brain fog. muscle and joint pain. and nerve issues. The president did not specifically mention long COVID in his speech. I want to speak directly to those with special conditions. No variants may make some existing protections effective for the immunocompromised.  Biden said Tuesday.  Sadly. this means you may be at a special risk. I urge you to consult with doctors on the right steps to protect yourself. Take extra precautions. When asked why Biden did not mention the significance of masks or long COVID. a White House spokesman said it is  undeniable  that updated vaccines are the best protection against the virus. When asked if the reason was due to worries about Republican reactions. the spokesman denied the notion. and has not yet answered HuffPost s additional question about whether Biden plans to do more for disabled and immunocompromised people who are feeling left to fend for themselves.COVID-19  deaths :are: preventable using a layered mitigation strategy (high quality. protective masks. tests. indoor air quality improvements. vaccines. sick leave policy that doesn t force sick folks to work. etc).  tweeted disability activist and Data for Progress fellow Matthew Cortland.  Yet. the [White House] continues this vaccine only strategy. ,Health News
Defending their country using the most innovative tools and methods available is what the warriors in Melinda s family have always done. In the 1980s. Melinda was working as an Air Force procurement officer in North Dakota when she met her husband who. like her father. flew B-52 bombers. Spending three years in Germany and relocating to a half dozen states while raising two sons. the couple was constantly on the move throughout her husband s 28-year career as a military aviator. Being able to adapt to new challenges became paramount for Melinda and her family.And over the years. as captain of her family s crew. Melinda learned to skillfully navigate the twists and turns of military life. But nothing quite prepared her for the bombshell that came in 2004 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  My oldest son was a senior in high school when I was diagnosed and my youngest was in middle school.  Melinda recalls.  Cancer is a word that scares everybody. We didn t know what was going to happen. I got radiation and then we passed the five-year mark of being cancer free and thought everything was good. I thought I had beaten cancer and was in the clear. Then. I found a lump on my collarbone. I ll never forget that call from the doctor: ‘I hate to say it. but it s back and you need to start chemotherapy.  In 2012. Melinda was diagnosed with stage IV HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). a cancer driven by a particular protein that had spread to other parts of her body. This began a decade-long odyssey of fighting her breast cancer with modern medicine s armamentarium of combination therapies against her recurring disease.But Melinda was determined to remain strong and overcome this challenge.When Melinda s oncologist found a cancer spot on her brain. doctors used gamma-knife in her brain. Over the next several years — with the support of her family. friends. and military community — Melinda continued to be optimistic while fighting her cancer. She was treated with various medications.  continued to spread to her shoulder. skin and lungs.By 2020. Melinda s oncologist noticed her tumor markers were rapidly increasing. which meant in Melinda s case. the treatment was no longer effectively controlling the cancer.herePlease see Important Safety Information for TUKYSA below.At her follow-up appointment. Melinda s oncologist shared great news: The treatment was working.Since taking the TUKYSA regimen. Melinda has experienced side effects of body aches and occasional constipation.While TUKYSA will not work for everyone. for Melinda. it has provided an opportunity to enjoy the things she loves.Experiences with TUKYSA differ among individuals. and TUKYSA will not work for everyone.Although MBC can never be cured. Melinda still emphasizes the importance of taking one day at a time and finding sources of happiness along the way.IndicationWhat is TUKYSA?TUKYSA is a prescription medicine used with the medicines trastuzumab and capecitabine to treat adults with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body such as the brain (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery. and adults who have received one or more anti-HER2 breast cancer treatments.

COVID-19updated booster shotsIt takes our bodies time to respond to the vaccine and for the vaccine to become fully effective. As we inch closer to Thanksgiving. it s crucial that you give the shot enough time to become as protective as possible.Here. experts share the ideal time to get your free booster shot:Dr. David WohlDr. Jason GallagherJust because Nov. 10 is the last day you can get the shot with the guarantee that it will be effective by Thanksgiving. that doesn t mean you have to wait until then to get the jab. From a logistics standpoint. I would get boosted now.  Gallagher said. He noted that many people will likely want to get their shot right before Thanksgiving. so it may be hard to get an appointment as we get closer and closer to the holiday.  If [you get] vaccinated now. will you still be protected at Thanksgiving? The answer to that is a pretty easy yes.  Gallagher said. So. there is no reason to delay.boosted by Halloweenvaccines.gov s vaccine finderwait at least two monthsAlso. remember that this booster shot is only available to people who have completed their primary vaccine series. If you are not vaccinated. you need to start with the primary two-dose vaccine series. which is also available at your local pharmacy.the dominant COVID subvariants This is the first time since the vaccines were first made available that we ve had a vaccine that matches well against a circulating variant.  Gallagher said.  You really want to maximize the benefit of that before those variants change by getting boosted as soon as possible. As of now. children and adults 5 and up can get the booster shot — but children who are 5 must get the Pfizer shot. The Moderna booster is currently only available to those 6 and up. With prior vaccination and immunity from previous infections. we are at less risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.  Wohl said.  But infection has consequences. according to a new study Vaccination has been found to lower the chance of [long COVID].  Wohl said. which is why it s even more important to get your vaccines when they re available to you. Protect yourself and others.Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

That s right: IThere are also some studiesdefendSeven years ago. in a cramped apartment on St. Mark s in Manhattan. I first became aware of fluid release during a sexual experience. It was a pivotal moment in my life. I developed feelings for someone for the first time. I thought I might have my first serious relationship. and I discovered something I had no idea my body was capable of.That first time I squirted wasn t a result of anything special. It was your run-of-the-mill. purely external oral sex. I was only aware I squirted because my partner told me. When we finally had penetrative sex. I didn t need his alert. There was enough evidence from the poor mattress I totaled.happenedThat relationship unfortunately ended shortly thereafter. so I did what any heartbroken. sexually frustrated person would do. I locked myself in my room and masturbated until I was able to replicate that same sensation. If my body could do this on its own. what else could it do? Curiosity killed the cat — or in this case. my pussy. In the weeks that followed. I set my body through a series of challenges. continuously amazed at my new discoveries. from setting a fountain stream from one end of the bathtub to the other — to squirting while standing. sitting. without orgasming and sometimes without any stimulation at all. I fell back on this new skill as a way to satisfy those who passed through my bedroom. It made them feel like excellent lovers even though it had little to do with their skill. It was a fun party trick. even if I didn t orgasm. I was seeking satisfaction from feeling desirable instead of prioritizing my own pleasure and comfort. After the initial novelty wore off. this supposed skill became my sexual hindrance. It wasn t a cute little one-off spurt. It was a never-ending. high-pressure hose. Technically. I can halt my squirting. but it also means stopping my pleasure. how to make your partner squirt.  let go and relaxThere needed to be more. Rather than taking a formulaic approach to squirting. finding the right spot or amount of pressure. I guide my students at their own pace. focusing on sensations and finding the kind of stimulation that feels good to each of them.Then I came across a factoid that a scientist had determined that the maximum amount of liquid someone could squirt was 900 ml. What started out as a joke of singlehandedly crushing the statistic quickly turned into a very possible reality when I discovered there was no standing Guinness world record for the largest volume from squirting. So. I applied. Turns out. I wasn t allowed to compete for the record due to the explicit nature of the record. as Guinness is a  family organization. With some digging into other sexual records. it was determined that if I set my record to Guinness standards with enough witnesses and journalists. I could call it mine. I chose the shortest amount of time allowed — a one-minute period — using only the assistance of one s hand — meaning no partners and no toys.That was my skill. Not only was I a high-volume faucet. but I could do so without external aid. I never penetrate myself nor orgasm. Those aren t part of the record stipulations per say. but it is imperative to the point I want to make with a record.Even though it didn t matter how much I squirted to set that initial record because there was no preexisting record to break. my ego wanted to hit a liter. Before that historic day in February of 2019. I had not measured my squirt. Sure. I did squirting performances at venues in NYC like The Box and House of Yes. but I had never collected the fluid. So. when 1250 ml of my nectar filled two separate measuring cups. even I was astounded at how much my body could contain and expel.Holding a squirting world record opened me up to as much scrutiny as it did publicity. This time. the proverbial floodgates opened with conversations from countless individuals about sub-par squirting experiences. stories of shame. partners pressuring them. and even concerns of other high-volume fluid producers.insteadDespite what science says my body is capable of. I squirt voluntarily. without correlation to orgasm. I set out to create this record partially because I am extremely competitive but also to start a conversation. using good old-fashioned shock and awe. After six years of squirting and being the poster child of squirt — or the face of squirting on faces. if you will — no matter how many times I engage in the  is squirt pee?  conversation. there is no answer I give that will satisfy the masses who are typically comprised of people who don t squirt. Sometimes. I wonder if their investment is from wanting to explain why their body doesn t do it or because their power is threatened by not being responsible for someone s bodily response. While I have my theories about the fluid. its contents. and where it comes from (and a new study theorizes it is partially made of urine but is not urine). I m tired of giving this much attention to the pee conversation because who fucking cares. Don t like it? Repulsed by it? Fine. move along. No one is forcing you to hook up with people who squirt. I don t squirt for the crowd. for my lovers. or for you. I squirt for me. I didn t set this record for anyone else. After years of my body and its behavior being made about others or up for public scrutiny. I m making of it what I want. It may be a far-fetched and over-the-top method of reclaiming my body while shifting the conversation. but it works for me. So when I embarked on defending my record in September of 2022. it was not due to my record being broken. but because I am that competitive ― even with myself. When I set the initial record. I wasn t competing against anyone. But this time. I had to contend with my past self. I bested my record by 100ml: 1350ml in the same 25 seconds. My spectators went from excited to shocked and finally concerned. I guess it is not as fun when it is a full swimming pool.I produce an impossible amount of liquid during sex. even when I don t want to. At times. the task of having to explain to lovers. hold their hands. deal with egos. accusations and manage cleanup is so daunting that I forgo sex altogether. Squirting is a manner in which my body reacts. Sometimes I love it. but I appreciate having the space to hate it. be frustrated. or wish it away. Owning my body s experience — in all its messiness — is freeing. The public can have its opinion on my world record. whether they think I m focusing on something silly or faking it or they make it entirely about their desire is irrelevant. This is something I m choosing to honor and celebrate about my own body in the hopes that others can find peace with theirs — even if it means hating it a little.

Like millions of others. I have eagerly awaited the release of  Midnights.  the newest album from Taylor Swift. While I ve always liked Taylor s music. my obsession really only kicked into full gear with  Folklore  and  Evermore.  her two 2020 albums. In fact. I combined the two into a playlist I called Everlore. I pre-ordered  Midnights  on vinyl. and then a lavender version was pre-released at Target and. I mean. purple is my favorite color and my recently purchased Victrola turntable is lavender. so yeah. I might ve ordered that one. too. (Apologies to my husband Thomas for finding out this way.) We re currently on a major road trip. so I probably won t listen to it until we get home. but I had to watch the video for the song  Anti-Hero  on my phone this morning as soon as I got up. And I mostly loved it! (Taylor bleeds purple glitter pen ink. and I m here for it.)Like I suspect so many of us will. I deeply related to these lyrics.  Midnights become my afternoons when my depression works the graveyard shift.  just as an example. should be my next tattoo. (It won t be. but I profoundly feel ― and live ― these words at times.)There s a definite sense of deep self-loathing and doubt in this song s lyrics. I love that Swift wrote about these feelings. that she s willing to let people see that you can have what looks like everything you could want. and still feel depression s insidious whispers. Depression isn t a measurement of a happy. fulfilling life. You can have both. You can have neither. The more people with major platforms openly talk about their mental health struggles. the less stigma there will be. and the more people will be willing to talk about their own struggles ― and. hopefully. seek help for them.Swift has spoken in the past about her issues with body image. so it is not surprising this would come through in these lyrics. where she sings.  I ll stare directly at the sun. but never in the mirror.  Again. I expect this to resonate with many of her fans all too well.Unfortunately. this is where we take a detour from my love of the music video. because at one point. the  Anti-Hero  version of Swift. who clearly represents her worst inner critic. has her get on a bathroom scale. When the real Taylor looks down. the scale reads  FAT. Sigh. The worst part of this is that the moment she got on that scale. I knew. Before the word popped up. I felt it coming in the pit of what s left of the stomach I had partially surgically amputated just to be more easily able to get an MRI. Because fatphobia is this pervasive in our culture. Taylor Swift is not. and has never been. even remotely fat. In fact. some of the negative criticism she s faced related to body image was about being  too skinny.  Swift has admitted this bothers her. but she has also talked about how she s seen comments speculating about her maybe being pregnant. and how those comments have resulted in her not eating. But  fat  isn t a bad word (to be clear. neither is skinny). It s a descriptive word society has turned into an insult. It took a lot (therapy. time. support from other fat activists) for me to be able to use  fat  to describe my body in a neutral way. and I d be lying if I said there are never days when it doesn t still pop into my head in exactly the same way this video means it to.The obvious difference is that unlike Taylor. I m not just fat. I m often the fattest person anyone knows. I m  superfat and that comes with a lot of baggage that I didn t pack. yet still have to carry. Someone who looks like Taylor will never understand how actually being fat feels. They might  feel fat.  because our culture has turned body size into feelings. and because even thin women are harmed by our society s insidious and painful messaging about bodies. but it is not the same as actually being fat. There are millions of lived experiences erased by this message. including mine. and it sucks. There are so many other words that this scale could have displayed that would have better conveyed the feelings Swift has experienced related to body image. without making it about fatness ― or for that matter. thinness. Because to be clear. I wouldn t support this scale saying  too skinny.  either. (But it didn t. and there s a reason  fat  is what her brain tells her is the worse word here.)Alternative words this scale could have displayed: Unworthy. Unlovable. Hated. Terrible. Bad. This list could go on and on. The point would then be that the scale cannot measure your worth. but if you let it. it will lie to you about your value. For her millions of fans. I would ve loved this to be a message of.  Your body size isn t what s most important. Instead. we see a thin woman being told she s fat by the scale. which sends the dangerous message that even thin people (especially women and femmes) are actually not thin enough. While I m writing this from the perspective of a fat person. I want to be clear that this message harms thin people. too. That s not a maybe. not in a video that already has 16 million views and 1.4 million likes in less than two days. I m not trying to  cancel  Taylor Swift. If anything. I feel very sad that with all of her success and talent. weight gain is still one of her worst fears. But it s not hard for me to understand. She was only 15 when she became famous. (At 15. I was hospitalized for my eating disorder for seven weeks.) She s literally lived more than half her life. starting as a young. impressionable teen. in the spotlight. She s grown up in an industry where she s lucky to still have the major career she does. especially as a woman. because so many young artists don t maintain this level of success for so long. I am not sure there s anyone who can live in (let alone grow up in) her world without absorbing these messages on a profound level. Becoming fat could quite literally end her career ― because that s how insidious fatphobia is in the world in general. forget about the entertainment industry. Let that sink in for a moment. However. this is exactly why I would love nothing more than for Taylor to change this scene in the video. Edit it out. or change the word. Either works. There s a responsibility that comes with a platform her size. and given how many of her fans are young. sometimes second generation Swifties. this is truly something that could have a powerful. positive impact. But as it stands. it s a profoundly negative one ― especially for her actually fat fans of all ages. It also allows her industry to perpetuate the very attitudes that led to her feeling this way. When Lizzo was recently called out for using a word in her lyrics that is an insult for many disabled fans. she changed the lyrics. Beyoncé used this same word. and also changed it. That was incredible to witness. These two brilliant. talented women listened to fans and didn t just respond. They acted. Given that most people view fatness as a choice. I don t expect much. if any. outrage over this moment in the video. at least outside of the fatactivismcommunity which has been trying to start a dialogue about this scene. But if it happened… well. that would send a very potent message to millions of people. I don t want anyone to suffer from an ED. but fat people have eating disorders. too. including anorexia. We already struggle with getting treatment for these potentially deadly conditions ― our pleas for help unheard. lost in the clamor of voices screaming about how our fatness itself is a disease. We re celebrated for losing weight. even if we re ― as Taylor said she did ― effectively starving ourselves. skipping meals or engaging in other harmful behaviors. We re supposed to be trying to be thin. at any cost … even if it s slowly killing us. the same as it kills our thin counterparts. That s why this matters so damn much. I won t be awake at midnight obsessing over or expecting this scene to be changed or removed… but I ll still daydream that it could happen.

Bigger Than The Whole Sky  is a heart-wrenching song about grieving someone gone too soon.While Swift hasn t shared whether the track is about a breakup. death or something else. the lyrics spoke deeply to those who ve had a miscarriage. Countless listeners shared their experiences with loss and reactions to the song on Twitter. Rebecca Reid It stopped me in my tracks ― I stopped and literally said out loud. this is about a miscarriage.  she added.  The lyrics about never getting to know someone. about the shortness of the time and the enormity of the impact. about how you ll always wonder what could have been. pointed to specific lyrics Goodbye. goodbye. goodbye / You were bigger than the whole sky /You were more than just a short time / And I ve got a lot to pine about / I ve got a lot to live without / I m never gonna meet / What could ve been. would ve been / What should ve been you / What could ve been. would ve been you. Dr. Jessica GoldKate Kennedy It beautifully captures a unique type of grief ― the kind where you love something so much you ve never met and wonder how it can be so devastating to lose something you never had.  she explained  It s hard to explain how profound a loss can be when your awareness of its existence only lasted a short time. Kennedy recalled well-meaning people attempting to comfort her by saying things like  at least you found out early  or  how long did you know you were pregnant?  You often wonder if they re asking as a means to gauge if your emotional response is proportionate to the length of your experience.  she said.  But it s not that simple. something that s a part of you for any amount of time can be profoundly impactful in ways we struggle to quantify. bigger than the whole sky. Other lyrics in the song suggest an attempt to make sense of a senseless and random loss.  Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia? / Did some force take you bеcause I didn t pray? Walnut Psychotherapy Therapy CenterClaire Winter Kislinger s pregnancy lossWhether or not that is the case. the lyrics are ambiguous enough to allow many fans to hear their own struggles and feel less alone. Ben BehnenBrit Barkholtz I see the song as permission to grieve out loud.  she said.  While grief can be a private thing as a matter of preference. often grief is a private thing because shame and fear and guilt and all sorts of other things convince us we need to hide that grief or soften its edges to be more palatable. And I see this song as putting it out there with all its complexity and messiness and saying. ‘it s OK to feel this way and to be open about it.  It s hard to overstate the significance of such a popular artist releasing a song that resonates with the pregnancy loss community.  We don t talk about these experiences enough and how common they are.  Gold explained.  Having a song that resonates with people. the large amounts of people. who have experienced pregnancy loss helps them feel less alone. especially in their emotional reactions and thought processes. There is value in normalizing the experience and breaking the silence about it because far too often these experiences can feel like they are not supposed to be shared or something to keep silent. She emphasized the importance of people understanding that miscarriages happen. that they aren t alone. and they are allowed to grieve the loss. even if it happened early in their pregnancy.  Pregnancy loss is so lonely.  Reid said.  This song is like a hand coming out from the ether and holding you. telling you they ve been there too. I ve always said that whatever you re going through. Taylor has a song for you. The only time that wasn t true was when I lost my baby in 2019. And now there is.  There is an expression that people who ve miscarried are in the worst club with the best members.  she added.  And now that club has an anthem. Those in mourning often feel a profound yearning for connection with others. even people they don t know. There may not be answers to what you re going through. but often what we need more than answers is comfort and hope.  Behnen said.  And sometimes hearing a song on the radio or in your playlist that speaks dearly to you is the exact comfort and hope you need. Beyond finding comfort in music. there are other helpful ways to cope with pregnancy loss. Gold encouraged people in this situation to talk about it. It is OK to feel anything you are feeling. on whatever timeline you feel it.  she said.  There is no right way to grieve or to experience loss. Try not to judge yourself for what you feel or how you are feeling. just allow yourself to be. Although a miscarriage can feel isolating. resist the urge to go through the motions all by yourself.  If you have friends or family that you trust and feel safe with. bring them in on how you are feeling.  Behnen advised.  Set up an appointment with a therapist. Join a support group. When we re hurting. we need people around us to hear us and hold us. Your feelings matter. He recommended tuning out those who try to tell you how to feel or question what you re experiencing. Give yourself plenty of space and time to process difficult emotions.  Sometimes grief can become unbearable. and in that case. it s OK and good for you to allow yourself to distract from it.  Behnen explained.  But eventually. it s also good to gently come back to these feelings and listen to them. Although grieving a miscarriage can feel different from mourning other types of losses. it s still a reflection of the deep love and hopes an expectant parent felt for the child they never met.  Letting yourself feel the pain of loss is also honoring the great love that you have had.  Behnen said.  It is a way of pulling the broken pieces of your heart back together again. The cracks will always be there. a reminder that you have loved greatly. ,Health News

The widow of a former University of Southern California football player suing the NCAA for failing to protect her husband from repetitive head trauma is taking what could be a landmark case to a Los Angeles jury Friday.Matthew Gee died in 2018 from permanent brain damage caused by countless blows to the head he took while playing linebacker for the 1990 Rose Bowl winning team. according to the wrongful death suit filed by Alana Gee.Of the hundreds of wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits For years (the NCAA) has kept players like Matthew Gee and the public in the dark about an epidemic that was slowly killing college athletes.  the lawsuit said.  Long after they played their last game. they are left with a series of neurological conditions that could slowly strangle their brains. The NCAA. the governing body of college athletics in the U.S.. said it wasn t responsible for Gee s death. which it blamed on heavy drinking. drugs and other health problems. Mr. Gee used alcohol and drugs to cope with a traumatic childhood. to fill in the loss of identity he felt after his football playing days ended. and to numb the chronic and increasing pain caused by numerous health issues.  NCAA lawyers wrote in a filing in Los Angeles Superior Court. The issue of concussions in sports. and football in particular. has been front and center in recent years as research has discovered more about long-term effects of repeated head trauma in problems ranging from headaches to depression and. sometimes. early onset Parkinson s or Alzheimer s disease.A 2018 trial in Texas led to a swift settlement after several days of testimony by witnesses for the widow of Greg Ploetz. who played defense for Texas in the late 1960s. In 2016. the NCAA agreed to settle a class-action concussion lawsuit. paying $70 million to monitor former college athlete s medical conditions. $5 million toward medical research and payments of up to $5.000 toward individual players claiming injuries.settlement covering 20.000 retired playersNFL acknowledged in 2016according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical AssociationAs with Seau. who killed himself in 2012.The defense has sought to exclude any testimony about Gee s teammates and the NCAA said there was no medical evidence Gee suffered from concussions at USC. Two ex-teammates. however. testified at depositions about blows they routinely took at a time when they were told to hit with their heads.Mike Salmon. who went on to the NFL s San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills. recalled Gee and other linebackers being  out of it  during hard-hitting practices.  Matt hit like a truck.  Salmon said.  I saw him quite a bit coming back to the huddle. You could tell ... he wasn t all there.  It was our job to make helmet-to-helmet contact in the  80s.  Gene Fruge. a former nose-tackle. testified.  There was no question about it. That was your job. to explode the man in front of you.  which required schools in 2010 to have a concussion protocol. The NCAA knew of the harmful effects ... on athletes for decades. they ignored these facts and failed to institute any meaningful methods of warning and/or protecting the athletes.  the lawsuit said.  For the NCAA. the continued expansion and operation of college football was simply too profitable to put at risk. In his senior year. Gee was team captain and led USC in tackles. forced fumbles and fumbles recovered.After graduating in 1992. Gee was cut by the Los Angeles Raiders in training camp. He married Alana. his college sweetheart. and they had three children as he ran his own insurance company in Southern California. For 20 years. he lived a  relatively normal  life. the suit said.That changed around 2013. when he began to lose control of his emotions. the lawsuit said. He became angry. confused and depressed. He drank heavily. He told a doctor days would go by without him being able to recall what happened.When he died on New Year s Eve 2018. the preliminary cause of death was listed as the combined toxic effects of alcohol and cocaine with other significant conditions of cardiovascular disease. cirrhosis and obesity.Joseph Low. a Los Angeles lawyer for clients with traumatic brain injury who is not involved in the case. said drug and alcohol abuse can become a symptom of brain injuries as those suffering try to self-medicate. Blaming Gee s death on substance abuse will not shield the NCAA from evidence showing he had CTE. which is not caused by drugs and alcohol. Low said. That s a distraction.  Low said.  It s really a disgusting way to do character assassination. It s what you call defense strategy 101. ,Health News

COVID-19report lays out grim trendsIt finds that pregnancy-related deaths have spiked nearly 80% since 2018. with COVID-19 being a factor in a quarter of the 1.178 deaths reported last year. The percentage of preterm and low birthweight babies also went up last year. after holding steady for years. And more pregnant or postpartum women are reporting symptoms of depression. We were already in the middle of a crisis with maternal mortality in our country.  said Karen Tabb Dina. a maternal health researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  This really shows that COVID-19 has exacerbated that crisis to rates that we. as a country. are not able to handle. The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. which authored the report. analyzed pregnancy-related deaths after Congress mandated that it review maternal health outcomes in the 2020 coronavirus relief bill.but COVID-19 has only worsened conditions here for pregnant womenwhile pregnant face elevated health risks. Staffing shortagespandemic stress has intensified depressionMental health issues likely contributed to the increase in pregnancy-related deaths. Tabb Dina said. Many women who experience depression and anxiety during or after their pregnancy struggle to get the care they need. Mental health is the greatest complication in pregnancy that we don t understand.  she said.The biggest spike in deaths came during July through December of last year. as the COVID-19 delta variant infected millions. noted Carolyn Yocom. a director at the Government Accountability Office. It s really clear from the data that the time in which the delta variant spread seemed to correspond to a huge increase in deaths.  Yocom said.The maternal death rate is particularly stark for Black women. who have long faced worse maternal outcomes than their peers.Pregnancy-related deaths for every 100.000 births climbed from 44 in 2019 to 68.9 among Black women last year. White women had death rates of 26.1 last year. a jump from 17.9 in 2019.Death rates among Hispanics had been on the decline. but they swelled again during the pandemic from 12.6 per 100.000 in 2019 to 27.5 last year.Black and Hispanic people have also died at higher rates from COVID-19. in part because they have less access to medical care and often work essential jobs that exposed them to the virusLong before COVID-19 began spreading. the stage was set for Black. low-income and rural women to receive subpar pregnancy care ― putting them at further risk for their pregnancies to go wrong. according to a separate GAO report.Hospitals have been shedding their obstetric services in rural areasMore than half of rural counties didn t have a hospital offering pregnancy care as of 2018. the review found. The loss of hospital-based obstetric services in rural areas is associated with increases in out-of-hospital births and pre-term births. which may contribute to poor maternal and infant outcomes.  the report found.,Health News
Breastfeeding is a complex process that every parent experiences differently. One s breastfeeding journey can change over time and vary from one baby to the next.And to make matters more confusing. there s a lot of unfamiliar jargon in the breastfeeding space. One term that often crops up is  breast milk storage capacity  or  breast storage capacity. To help demystify this phrase. we asked breastfeeding experts to break it down for nursing parents and parents-to-be. Share the DropBecause breast storage capacity has nothing to do with the size of one s breasts. a mother with small breasts could actually have a higher capacity than one with larger breasts.Boston Baby Nurse & NannytwostudiesIt s possible to have breasts with two different storage capacities as well. La Leche League AllianceIf your storage capacity is larger. your breasts may not reach that  full  stage as quickly. and your baby may require less frequent feedings. she added. It s important to note that not everyone in the breastfeeding community is on board with the idea of  breast storage capacity. Dr. Sheela Rath GeraghtyShe explained that all babies drink different amounts of milk from the breast at each feeding. The idea that babies should always consume the same amount of milk is based on bottle feeding and is  not physiologically normal.  There is no way to say that a mother will ever get the same out of the breasts each time that they have milk extracted from their body. whether by a pump or a baby.  Geraghty said.  We as people eat different amounts each time we eat. Breastfed babies extract different amounts of milk from the breast every time that they eat as well.  It s not possible to increase your storage capacity since it is physical. but again. it does not have to do with the amount of milk you produce.  Thomas said.Interestingly. multiple experts noted that there is some anecdotal evidence of storage capacity increasing in subsequent pregnancies. But that has not been adequately studied and would be outside a parent s control anyway. Some women notice a slight increase in milk capacity with additional pregnancies.  Arsenault said.  If a mom is diagnosed with insufficient glandular tissue. it is still possible to breastfeed. but she will likely have to get creative and augment the feedings. Breast storage capacity  does not need to be a concern of breastfeeding parents.  Thomas said.  If anything. it s an incidental finding. where you might think. ‘Hm. My baby seems to breastfeed on the frequent side. Maybe my breast storage capacity is on the smaller side.  or. ‘Huh. My baby is gaining well. but seems to nurse less frequently than I expected. Maybe my breast storage capacity is on the larger side.  She explained that feeding according to your baby s cues is what matters and will ensure that they re getting enough to eat.  As long as baby has the number of wet and dirty diapers expected and is gaining well. it is of no concern what your storage capacity is.  Thomas said. Between the recent formula shortages and guidance from certain breastfeeding blogs. many parents feel added pressure to produce even more milk and have a deep  stash  in their freezers.But Geraghty warned that this pressure can lead them to pump too frequently and possibly develop engorgement and mastitis in the process. Don t concern yourself with what you think your breast storage capacity is or try to  compensate  by nursing or pumping more than necessary.  What makes a mother feel accomplished at feeding her baby is when she is successful at making the right amount of milk for her baby.  Geraghty said.  A breastfed baby s behavior should be watched closely ― when the baby is satisfied and full. the baby will be calm. If the baby did not eat enough. the baby will be fussy and want to go back on the breast and be fed more. If you aren t producing enough milk to satisfy your baby or are having trouble effectively latching. seek help from a professional. Together. you can find research-backed solutions and figure out what works best for you and your child.  The concept of breast storage capacity reiterates that each woman s body is different and each woman s breastfeeding journey will be different.  Huffstetler said.  Knowing your own body and what your own baby needs is an important part of every woman s breastfeeding journey. ,Health News

hearing aids available over the counter without a prescription or an appointmentIt s a game-changer for many disabled people. who say the ruling will benefit millions of Americans with hearing loss. At the same time. the ruling illuminates barriers to hearing aid access that members of the disabled community say still need to be addressed. HuffPost spoke to experts in the field who unpacked the benefits of over-the-counter hearing aids ― and aired some concerns about their rollout. I m thrilled with this leap forward.  Glenda Sims. chief information accessibility officer at the digital accessibility firm Deque. told HuffPost.  People that want to enhance their hearing. or get back to a level of hearing that they had. if they have mild or moderate hearing loss. [and] that couldn t afford it in the past. are really going to have it much more within their reach when there are some that are going to be available at $200 versus thousands of dollars. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disordersaverage cost of one prescription hearing aidOver-the-counter hearing aids are now available at major retailers such as Walgreens and CVS at a significantly lower cost. and are estimated to save consumers $3.000 per pair of hearing aids. Sims said that her best friend had been experiencing hearing loss in one of her ears. but she struggled to afford hearing aids as a single parent on an elementary school teacher s salary. She ended up paying $2.000 out of pocket for prescription hearing aids. She couldn t pay for it.  Sims said.  It s riding on credit card debt because she needed it. She can t hear the ends of the words that the kids are saying to her in class. OTC hearing aids can also be beneficial to someone with mild to moderate hearing loss who previously may not have had access to prescriptions. Laura Pratesi. a doctor of audiology who is also hard of hearing. said many patients fall into that category and would benefit from having some technology. but can t afford or don t necessarily need prescription hearing aids.studiesSims believes that commercialization of OTC hearing aids. along with more innovation. could destigmatize the devices. Pratesi notes that the advent of Bluetooth technology and AirPods has breathed new life into the hearing health care sphere. I ve had patients that don t necessarily love the idea of getting hearing aids. but when I tell them. ‘This can connect to your iPhone. this can connect to your Android.  you re like. ‘Oh. that s so cool.   she said. One issue professionals see with OTC hearing aids is that consumers may not have the technological savvy to choose the right products. Jaipreet Virdi. a history professor at the University of Delaware. said she believes the FDA s ruling for OTC hearing aids is a good thing. especially given the cost-saving advantages. However. she s concerned that not everyone will have the technological know-how to take full advantage. It ll be great that people will go and buy the right hearing aid that s more affordable for them. but they might not get the full benefit from the products that they would need.  Virdi told HuffPost.Audiologists can calibrate hearing aids and program them to an individual s audiological range. as well as provide services such as aural rehab. auditory training. cleaning and software updates. to ensure the user is getting the most out of the device. Still. affording these services along with the cost of prescription hearing aids can be difficult. Sims notes that this is a reason some people may want to get OTC hearing aids rather than prescription ones. If I needed [hearing aids] right now ... I would go to an audiologist.  Sims said.  They re going to walk me through step by step. they re going to know all kinds of things about sound and ears and adjustments.  I just spoke from privilege.  she added.  I could afford to do that. instead of doing the research myself. I could also do the research myself and be patient and have a little bit more trial and error. So I think audiologists and doctors are still an important piece of the puzzle. It s just nice to not force it. OTC hearing aids are limited in some ways because they don t help children or people with profound hearing loss. Pratesi said. For example. Maria Page. 53. said that her hearing loss is too great to be able to benefit from OTC hearing aids. Due to my inner ear hearing loss. my very small. in-the-ear-canal hearing aids have a custom fit so that I can wear them all day. every day.  Page told HuffPost.  Will the over-the-counter hearing aids have custom fits? I suspect not. because that would mean additional expense. Hearing aids aren t a one-size-fits-all model. Virdi said. She uses the analogy of getting eyeglasses: Some people. depending on their visual needs. can go to the store and try on different glasses to figure out which ones help them see more clearly. But other people need to get their eyes examined and assessed by an ophthalmologist to determine which prescription lens would work best for them.Page worries that the FDA s ruling on OTC hearing aids and the one-size-fits-all mindset will lead some people to jump to the wrong conclusions. If anything. this FDA decision will have a negative impact on me. because everyone else will expect that I will be able to easily and somehow more cheaply get hearing aids on a regular basis.  she said.  I will have to explain even harder how that is not the case. unbundled I want audiological care to be affordable and accessible for everybody.  Pratesi said.  If over the counter works for what someone needs. that s fantastic. If over the counter doesn t work for what somebody needs. nobody should have to go without audiological care because of cost. congressional hearings starting in the 1960s As long as they re being promoted as a consumer product. where consumers make the decision about which hearing aid fits their need. and not as a medical device that means it s covered by insurance ... we re always going to be limited.  she said.American Speech-Language-Hearing AssociationMedicare Audiologist Access and Services Act If we think about where we re going in the future. I think we should push more for the devices to be covered by insurance ― and not just the devices. but all associated costs that go along with it.  Virdi said.  I think that s one thing that I really hope will change. Some experts predict that OTC hearing aids will ultimately lead to more innovation and lower costs. Pratesi believes there will be a shift in practices offering more unbundled services. which would also result in lower costs.OTC hearing aids have also started important conversations about inaccessibility. and how hearing aids. American Sign Language and cochlear implants are all tools to help people with various communication goals. Pratesi said. Still. she doesn t want change to stop here. I m excited for what this legislation does. But I don t want people to think that ‘OK. great. we passed OTC and now we re there.  We re not there.  she said.  There s still more people that need to be helped. there s still more changes that we need to make so that audiological care is affordable and accessible for everyone. ,Health News
FederalThe Food and Drug Administration s advisory panel voted 14-1 Wednesday that the injectable drug Makena should be withdrawn. despite appeals from the manufacturer to keep it available pending additional research.rare public hearing If we allow Makena to remain on the market. it implies the FDA looked at a large study. found no benefit and yet allowed this drug to stay on the market.  said Dr. Margery Gass. an obstetrics specialist.  I think that s a bad precedent. Gass and other panelists encouraged Covis to continue studying the drug to determine if a subgroup of women could benefit. I do think that our patients deserve an answer and they deserve that well-designed clinical trial and I think that taking the drug off the market is going to allow that.  said Dr. Mary Munn of the University of South Alabama.FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf is expected to make a final decision on withdrawing the drug in the next several months. If he follows the panel s advice. it would be the first time the FDA has formally pulled a drug that it initially approved based on promising early data.The FDA granted Makena accelerated approval in 2011 based on one small study in which it appeared to reduce the rate of premature birth in women with a history of the problem. Preterm birth raises the risk of disability and death in infants and affects about 10% of U.S. deliveries.FDA s approval was conditioned on a larger follow-up study to confirm whether Makena resulted in healthier outcomes for babies.But in 2019. results from that 1.700-patient international study showed the drug neither reduced premature births — as originally thought — nor resulted in healthier outcomes for infants.The FDA has been moving to revoke the drug s approval since then. But the long. bureaucratic process underscores the difficulty of removing a drug from the market when a manufacturer won t do so voluntarily.Luxembourg-based Covis Pharma argued this week that Makena benefits women at highest risk of early deliveries. including Black Americans. and proposed narrowing its approval to that group while it conducted another study to confirm effectiveness. The company s presentations included outside experts who said removing Makena would worsen racial disparities in prenatal care. The FDA should do what is best for our patients. which is to keep this medication available for those of us who manage these very high-risk patients every day.  Dr. Yolanda Lawson. an obstetrics specialist at Baylor University. told the FDA panel.But the experts ultimately sided with FDA scientists. who stressed that they were  unable to identify a group of women for whom Makena had an effect.  The drug also carries risks. FDA noted. including blood clots and depression.accelerated approval programMakena has become something of a poster child for the program s downsides. since the drug has remained on the market for more than a decade without any confirmed benefit. According to a recent federal report. the U.S. has spent $700 million on Makena since 2018 through various government programs. including Medicaid.About 350.000 women have used the drug in the last decade. according to Covis.Even if the drug is removed. some doctors are expected to continue prescribing its key ingredient as a specialty medication. Compounding pharmacies have long offered their own formulations of the drug. Both Makena and the compounded medications consist of a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone. which helps the uterus grow and maintain a pregnancy.___This story has been corrected to show that the panel member who commented on the potential for bad precedent was Margery Gass. not Margaret Gatz.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

In the seven months since Russian forces seized Europe s largest atomic energy station. Ukrainian engineers have managed to keep the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant running safely even as artillery shells repeatedly destroyed the facility s backup electricity. But as temperatures drop heading into winter. the risk of a radiation accident is rising. the head of Ukraine s state nuclear company told HuffPost on Tuesday. As fighting intensified last month. operators powered down the last of the plant s six reactors lest another electrical outage jeopardize the cooling systems needed to keep the scorching-hot radioactive material from melting down even when the reactor is idle.  It was the safest nuclear power plant in Ukraine. and now it is the most dangerous nuclear power plant in the whole world.  said Petro Kotin. president of Ukrainian state-owned nuclear plant operator Energoatom. He spent most of his career working at Zaporizhzhia. But Energoatom. Ukraine s state-owned nuclear plant operator. wants to restart at least one of the reactors. A Russian bombing blitz over the last week destroyed 30% of Ukraine s electrical infrastructure. spurring widespread blackouts. And the neighboring towns where Zaporizhzhia s workers live have no other source of warmth in the winter besides a district heating system hooked up to the power plant. Restarting a reactor is also a matter of safety at the plant. There s a limited amount of diesel to run the generators that provide the last-resort power to keep the plant s cooling system running — running heaters to keep the storage tanks containing refueling water would only drain the supply sooner. Even before we de-occupy the plant. because of the decrease in temperature. we need just to start this one unit to supply steam for heating purposes of the plant itself.  Kotin said dressed in dark green military fatigues as he spoke to HuffPost for 80 minutes over Microsoft Teams from his office in Kyiv. roughly 400 miles northwest of Zaporizhzhia.Then there are the fish. Zaporizhzhia collects water for its cooling system from an outdoor pond. which operators stocked with an imported fish species to eat algae that could otherwise gum up the reactor turbines. A running reactor expels warm water into the pond. keeping temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at all times — and. by extension. keeping the Egyptian fish alive. With no reactors running. water temperatures would eventually drop below 50 degrees. Kotin said.  All the fish will be killed by this cold temperature.  said Kotin. After that. the plant would have up to 2.000 tons of dead fish to deal with.  It s getting cold.  Kotin said.  And some problems arise there. with the functionality of the plant. with the fish that help keep the pond good. and with the condition of people living in the neighboring town. where the heat is all generated by the plant.  Four high-voltage cables link Zaporizhzhia to the Ukrainian grid. while another low-voltage backup line runs to a nearby coal-fired power plant. Artillery fire repeatedly severed those connections as Ukrainians and Russians blamed each other for indiscriminate shelling. disrupting the plant s operations at least 15 times since the occupation began in March. But on Aug. 25. the station was cut off from outside power sources for the first time. forcing its operators to rely on Zaporizhzhia s 20 diesel generators to keep electricity flowing to the cooling systems. After more than three hours without electricity. Kotin said. a partial meltdown akin to what happened in Fukushima. Japan. in 2011 would likely begin. Engineers restored the low-voltage line in less than a day and eventually reconnected the plant to the grid. But bombardments have destroyed substations and power lines at least twice more since then. according to Kotin. Meanwhile. he said. the coal plant no longer has fuel. And Russian artillery destroyed one of the lines connecting Zaporizhzhia to Ukraine s grid as recently as Monday. leaving the plant dependent on the diesel generators. The facility typically only stores enough diesel to run the generators for 10 days. To preserve fuel. plant operators started running no more than seven generators at a time. which could conserve enough fuel to keep the power on for up to 17 days. Kotin said. Russian and Ukrainian officials allowed shipments of diesel fuel last week that could give Zaporizhzhia another two full days of generator use. But Kotin saw the rare moment of cooperation as a sign the Russians were  prepared to continue this practice  of cutting the plant off from the power grid. It s part of what Ukrainian officials say is a strategy to steal Zaporizhzhia permanently. a power plant worth $30 billion and whose eponymous home province Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed into Russia late last month. Grid They don t have the people to operate that plant.  Moore told the news website. warning it would take thousands of workers to restaff the facility. This month. Russian officials threatened to fire Energoatom employees who don t sign new contracts to work for Rosatom. Russia s state-owned nuclear operator. Losing their jobs would likely make the workers eligible for the Russian military draft. Senior employees at the plant. meanwhile. have faced kidnappings. beatings. and alleged torture. and at least two workers have been killed by Russian forces.An International Atomic Energy Agency team arrived in late August at Zaporizhzhia to monitor the situation. Since then. the United Nations  nuclear watchdog has been negotiating to create a demilitarized zone around the plant.  The threats of the first wartime nuclear attack since 1945 and the worst atomic power plant accident since Fukushima have. ironically. come at just the moment when nuclear energy looks poised to reverse decades of decline and make a comeback. Fission reactors produce 24/7 bounties of electricity like fossil fuels. without climate-changing emissions or reliance on constantly-supplied pipelines. Since Russia cut off gas exports to Ukraine s allies. countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have vowed to build new reactors. Japan and the U.S. are looking to restart shuttered plants. and even anti-nuclear Germany is postponing plans to close its last three generating stations. Energoatom is hoping to build as many as nine new reactors in the years ahead. ideally. with American or European technology. Kotin said. In July. Ukraine began the process to license U.S. nuclear giant Westinghouse s AP-1000 reactors. the large-scale machines set to debut soon at Georgia s Plant Vogtle after years of delays and billion-dollar cost overruns. The U.S.. Kotin said. needs to get past the problems with constructing the first major AP-1000 project and build more reactors. But he admitted that the fate of a global nuclear power resurgence might rest in the hands of Zaporizhzhia s Ukrainian engineers.  The renaissance of civilian nuclear power would not survive this additional disaster. which could happen at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.  Kotin said.  So we need to do everything just to bring Zaporizhzhia to a safe stage and to make all the measures which are required for the safe operation of the plant. ,Health News
many people avoided the dentistbooster shotsDr. Richard M. LipariHere. dentists share the most common dental issues they re seeing now:teeth grindingDr. Albert CoombsWhen you grind your teeth. you break down the enamel and create vertical or horizontal fractions in the tooth.  Depending on the type of fractures. we can do a large filling. a root canal or even have to remove the tooth because it was just that far damaged.  Coombs said.It s important to treat the grinding itself ― not just the problems. like tooth fractures. that result.  If we are not treating the bruxism. the tooth is just going to get re-damaged.  Coombs said.  If it broke a healthy tooth. it will break a tooth with a filling in it. it will break a root canal and it will even damage an implant. Treatments for grinding your teeth can include wearing a mouthguard at night. getting Botox and having a healthy plan for stress management. We re seeing a higher rate of cavities. and we think a lot of it has to do with the lifestyle change for people.  Lipari said. That pandemic-induced shift has to do with more hours at home. with full access to your fridge and pantry. I think we re finding people are snacking a bit more. especially on foods that maybe they weren t eating as routinely when they were going to and from their office.  Lipari said. This lifestyle change. which for many people involves more frequent consumption of sugary foods and drinks. is leading to a higher rate of tooth decay. he noted. Dental problems are kind of like roof leaks.  Coombs said.  If you have a small roof leak. it might go away for a little bit. but you know it s going to come back far worse.  The same goes for dental problems. Over time. as the dental issues progress. the solutions are more evasive and often more expensive.  Coombs said. What starts as a small cavity may turn into a larger cavity that has to be treated with a more intense procedure if it s been neglected.After missed appointments. a fear of taking off your mask in public (a necessary part of visiting the dentist) and a period of time when dental exams and cleanings were not considered an essential pandemic service in many places. it s only to be expected that dental neglect is fairly common throughout the country.But this issue existed before the pandemic. too. Coombs noted ― it s just that there s been an increase lately.According to Coombs. one of the biggest issues he sees in his older patients is missing teeth. which can be the result of a number of untreated issues. 40 million Americans are missing either all of their top teeth or all of their bottom teeth. About 23 million are missing all of their teeth full stop. according to Coombs. and about 178 million people are missing at least one tooth.Even a single missing tooth can compound into bigger problems. like wear and tear on the teeth surrounding it. Eventually. it can lead to even more missing teeth. If you are missing two teeth on the right side. you end up favoring the left side.  Coombs said.  So you have more breakdown on the left side of the mouth. because that s where you re doing the chewing. This is an issue that predates the pandemic. but it s been made worse for some people because of long breaks between dentist visits. Inflation is also a factor: Dentistry is expensive. as Coombs noted. and getting a tooth pulled is often cheaper than other treatments.It is recommended that you go to the dentist for a checkup and cleaning every six months. according to both Coombs and Lipari.But Lipari noted that one schedule doesn t necessarily fit all.  It really depends patient to patient. [For] some people who may have gum and bone issues. it may be advisable for them to go see their dentist three to four times a year.  he said.The right cadence for you will be decided during those biannual visits. And keep in mind that if you experience tooth sensitivity or pain. it s likely a good idea to schedule an appointment. You aren t alone if you haven t been to the dentist since the onset of the pandemic. but you should prioritize getting back on your six-month schedule. Lipari said. You don t want a small problem to turn into a large one. It s really to get ahead of these things.  he said.  because you don t want it to become more problematic than it is. ,Health News
Hurricane Ian s deluge of floodwater in Florida has fueled a 12-year high in infections from a deadly bacteria that spreads in warm. brackish water. according to state data.Vibrio vulnificusstate Health Department reportedThe number of infections caused by the bacteria. which can spread through open wounds and scrapes that come in contact with bacteria-ridden floodwaters. are nearly double those seen in 2021 or 2020. and surpass the 12-year peak of 50 cases logged in 2017 after Hurricane Irma.Most of this year s iCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.described as  abnormal to the CDC.2013 study found that  Lee County public alert Fox 17 News reported.The man s fiancee said he thought antibacterial ointment would be enough.

Donald Trumplatest reportFormer CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said the administration restricted agency officials from participating in media interviews or briefings. at a time when he thought Americans  should have heard from the public health leaders. The White House tried to assert control over public guidance on COVID-19. with Trump installing his ally Michael Caputo as assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. the CDC s parent agency.Kate Galatas. a senior communications official at the CDC. told the subcommittee that Caputo acted with the intention of making others  feel threatened. The subcommittee saw evidence that Caputo blasted Dr. Jay Butler. the CDC s deputy director of infectious diseases. for being  too alarming  during a June 2020 telebriefing. In a separate instance. Paul Alexander. a senior adviser to Caputo. wrote to CDC officials to attack one of their reports. which he considered contradictory to information that the White House was putting out. and to allege that the agency s work was hurting the administration. as well as Americans at large.In May 2020. Alexander also edited language in a draft CDC statement regarding the pandemic s death toll in the U.S. to make it  more positive.  according to an email reviewed by the subcommittee.Redfield also said the administration  compromised  the agency s COVID-19 guidance in several instances to paint a rosier picture of the pandemic.Trump officials  efforts to project a better image of the pandemic in the U.S. affected employee morale but also could have put lives in danger. according to the report.Dr. Anne Schuchat. principal deputy director at the CDC. told the subcommittee that she believed fewer Americans would have died in the early days of the pandemic if the CDC had been allowed to put out accurate information.Redfield said that he developed post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of managing the writing process for COVID-19 guidance during his time in office.The report also demonstrated the extent to which Trump s White House sought to use the CDC s authority to push its own political agenda.Dr. Martin Cetron. the director of CDC s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. said his department was  handed  an order to justify deporting asylum-seekers arriving at the U.S. border under Title 42. a 1944 public health law that would immediately return them to their countries of origin while also denying them the opportunity to apply for asylum. Redfield was the one to sign the order.Joe Bidencourt has so far blocked itCetron also told the subcommittee that the Trump administration was hesitant to issue a mask mandate on public transportation even though the private sector had urged it to do so. Cetron said such rules around masks could have prevented the deaths of many Americans from COVID-19 in 2020.The subcommittee also found that administration officials tried to block the release  of at least 19 different CDC scientific reports that they deemed to be politically harmful to President Trump. Specifically. Health and Human Services officials manipulated a CDC publication known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to obscure early signs of COVID-19 transmission.House investigators found that the Trump administration also used hundreds of millions of dollars in CDC funds for a campaign. led by Caputo. to  defeat despair and inspire hope  around the pandemic before the 2020 presidential election.an interview with CNNCNNsaid in a statement This prioritization of politics. contempt for science. and refusal to follow the advice of public health experts harmed the nation s ability to respond effectively to the coronavirus crisis and put Americans at risk.  Clyburn said.The South Carolinian said work still remains to  safeguard scientific integrity and restore the American people s trust in our public health institutions. The subcommittee has been investigating the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic for over two years. This is its third report to be published.,Health News
Tucker CarlsonDemocratsFox Newsprioritizing marketing and outreach over family-care funds So. really what you have here is a classic demand-side approach to the ongoing diaper and formula shortages: just don t have kids. dumbo. and then you won t need diapers.  Carlson opined.  You also won t need a house or a car or a raise or extra food or money for college tuition.  When you get to this point. and this point is a place where the economy is so completely distorted that only Democratic voters ― donors ― can still afford to have normal families. When you get there. the solution is simple: Don t reproduce! Childlessness is the cure for the economy they created. And that s why abortion is so very important. especially now.

We ve all heard about Sober October or Dry January a finite period of time when people voluntarily stop drinking alcohol as a way to give their body a  break  or  reset. Abstaining from alcohol doesn t need to be a trend reserved only for a specific month. If you are looking to take a break from drinking at any point. there are numerous mental and physical benefits in doing so. Some changes associated with temporary alcohol abstinence can be harmful if not done under adequate supervision. particularly if you have an alcohol use disorder. But if you re someone who has a more casual relationship with drinking. there are perks to simply cutting it out for an extended period of time. We spoke to a few health experts to better understand what temporary alcohol abstinence does for the mind and body. and what to know before starting:Perhaps one of the immediate changes you will see after coming off alcohol is clearer skin. Alcohol causes the body and skin to lose fluid and dehydrate. creating a dullish. gray appearance. It can also cause acne because it changes hormonal levels.  Skin and face color often return to normal … your elasticity will be restored and yellowness. redness. or grayish [color] around the eyes or face will diminish with abstinence. and inflammation in the body will be reduced.  said Corey Weber. clinical manager at Warriors Heart. an addiction treatment center in Bandera County. Texas. Even a temporary break from alcohol can help the skin feel and look more rejuvenated and refreshed.Sometimes people have a glass of wine or a drink to unwind and relax before bed. thinking it will help them ease into a better sleep routine. However. excessive drinking or drinking over long periods of time can disrupt sleep patterns. often causing broken sleep or discomfort through the night. When you take a break from alcohol.  sleep patterns will often return to normal and REM sleep and quality of sleep will return to healthy patterns.  Weber said. In lieu of an alcoholic beverage before sleep. try other alternatives like decaffeinated warm tea or warm milk. In general. better sleep also improves mood and quality of life.There are also mental and neurological changes that can occur as a result of short-term abstinence. When you drink. alcohol affects the cerebral cortex. the part of the brain that is responsible for judgment and reasoning. as well as the cerebellum. which is responsible for balance and coordination.  Abstinence from alcohol over several months will improve memory and thinking. Also. it will allow structural brain changes to partially correct and memory or cognitive functions such as problem-solving. attention span. and rational thinking will increase.  Weber explained.TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention identifies alcohol as a carcinogen. meaning that drinking raises the risk of cancer. Alcohol has been associated with mouth and throat cancer. cancer in the larynx. esophagus. colon and liver. and breast cancer in women. Scientifically speaking. the body breaks alcohol into a chemical called acetaldehyde. which is a known contributor to tumors. But longer-term cessation decreases the risk of developing cancer because the body isn t exposed to this toxin. said Dr. Lawrence Weinstein. a board-certified physician and chief medical officer of American Addiction Centers.Heavy drinking on a night out or over time can lead to a number of diseases. such as liver damage (cirrhosis). fatty liver and even pancreatitis. Dr. Bruce Bassi. a board-certified addiction psychiatrist. said abstaining from alcohol. even temporarily. can improve how organs in the nervous system. cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal systems recover and improve.  Since alcohol can affect the absorption and utilization of vitamins and nutrients. abstinence from alcohol allows your body to start to use these more effectively again.  he explained.Additionally. Weinstein noted that research shows your cardiovascular health returns to baseline in just one month after eliminating alcohol.Restricting or eliminating your alcohol consumption for a brief period of time could help mitigate any complications with your mental health.Alcohol is known to exacerbate or contribute to depression. anxiety and more. Research shows that anxiety can increase post-drinking. with many people experiencing mood effects following the comedown from alcohol. Alcohol is also a depressant. which can cause neurotransmitters in the brain ― like serotonin. which is responsible for positive emotions ― to go haywire. As the University at Buffalo s Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions states:The misfiring of certain neurotransmitters. such as serotonin. is directly related to clinical depression (not to be confused with temporarily  feeling bad  after a bout of heavy drinking. which goes away after a few days).Bassi also noted that the body may go through withdrawal once alcohol is no longer part of your system.  There are many ‘post-acute  effects of alcohol abstinence which last up to one year.  he said.  Some of the post-acute symptoms are unpleasant and perpetuate the use of alcohol. which makes it so difficult to stop. The post-acute symptoms include trouble concentrating. irritability. fatigue. low motivation. anxiety and mood swings. Alcohol withdrawal in long-term drinkers can be serious. as it can result in seizures and delirious tendencies. If you are not comfortable or able to quit alone. then seek the assistance of a physician or quit in a controlled setting. such as a treatment facility. Weinstein added that there are medications (like naltrexone) that can help by blocking the reinforcing effects of alcohol and decrease the likelihood of continued drinking. but they should be utilized with proper behavioral treatment. Any medicinal use should be discussed with a medical professional prior to use.Overall. abstinence can have a positive outcome for your body and brain – whether it s a brief break from alcohol or (ideally) something longer.

I first started obsessing over my weight as a teenager growing up in a seemingly perfect family in our perfect house on a hill overlooking Dayton. Ohio. When I first told my mother I wanted to lose weight. she drove me to a diet center in town. where they taught me to become an expert at drastically cutting my calories. I lost both pounds and my period. But what I gained was something I could control during a time of family turmoil that was spiraling out of control. Much like me. my family looked perfect on the outside but was unpredictable. unstable. and even chaotic behind closed doors. Dad was chief of staff at the hospital and having an affair with a nurse. I knew something was going on. as most children do. but it was all unspoken. A secret. Mom would get calls from someone who always hung up. Dad moved out. then back in. then out again because they couldn t make up their mind about divorcing. Having my own secret coping mechanism in a family full of secrets makes sense now that I look back on it. The only thing I could control in my life for years was my food and weight.Until that got out of control. too. Meticulous calculations and constant obsessions with weight and food were my normal default. The unsurprising thing about starving is that it makes you quite hungry. So when I did let myself eat. I d inhale whole boxes of Keebler Fudge Stripes and Frosted Flakes. bags of Snyder s hard pretzels. and an obscene amount of chocolate chip ice cream. Ravenous. I simply could not stop once I let the tiger out of her cage. The only two things that scared me more than my binges were the idea of gaining weight from all of this eating. Since I couldn t control the eating part. I taught myself how to throw up to manage the weight gain. As disgusting as it was. it worked. I d heard of something called anorexia. but never bulimia. In fact. I thought I d invented it! The term bulimia hadn t even been coined until 1979. and it didn t appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 1987. The term  eating disorder  itself had only made its first appearance in the manual in 1980. I d scour Waldenbooks for literature on people who did the things that I did with food. but those books hadn t been written yet.Today. it s totally different. Words like eating disorder. anorexia and bulimia are in the mainstream vernacular. Supermodels. influencers and people on social media speak about their struggles with these disorders openly. It s easy (maybe even too easy) to find information on disordered eating by Googling it. But this was 1983. Google didn t exist yet. The mainstream internet didn t even exist! I had no idea what to do about my problem.Secrecy and shame are essential parts of bulimia. especially when living in a house full of family members. so I was hiding and lying like a criminal in my own home. Moving into a sorority house in college only made the sneaking around worse. as I was now sharing a bathroom and kitchen with over a dozen other people. I got even better at covering my tracks. I d run the shower to drown out the noise of it all. brush my teeth constantly to cover up  vomit breath.  and make excuses for the calluses on my knuckles. I wouldn t be surprised if my fellow sorority sisters were doing the exact same thing behind closed bathroom doors. also thinking they d invented purging. Even though it was hard living with people who might notice what I was doing. I soon realized it s far worse having zero witnesses. After college. I was determined to be a successful working woman. shoulder pads and all. so I moved to Dallas — an up-and-coming city made famous by the prime-time soap opera of the same name. Even though I knew only one person there. I was so proud to have my very own furnished apartment in a trendy singles complex and Toyota Corolla with a cream interior. I was free to do (and eat!) what I wanted when I wanted. Since I didn t have close girlfriends or even roommates to distract me. I soon fell into old. familiar habits. On my way home from work. I d stop by the Piggly Wiggly. fill my basket with junk food. and make up a detailed alibi in case the cashier happened to comment on my items on her conveyor belt. I d start my binge on the car ride home and wrap it up by the time David Letterman was over. After spending an exhausting amount of energy and time getting rid of all that food in my toilet. I d pass out and start the cycle all over again the next day. Instead of looking forward to weekends. I dreaded any unstructured time alone.This routine was starting to scare me. so I found a group through Southern Methodist University for people with eating  issues.  The only thing they helped me do was get better at purging. Thanks to them. I even discovered the wonders of Ex-lax (which tastes nothing like chocolate!) and a gross syrup called ipecac that makes you vomit violently. (It s now banned. as it should be!)Over time. things only got worse. My glands were so swollen that I had a double chin. I knew this cycle wasn t good for my body. and I lived in constant fear of someone finding me dead on the bathroom floor. Here I d moved to Dallas to live my best 20-something life. Instead. I was completely alone. hiding from the world. eating food out of my garbage can after I d attempted to dispose of it.I booked a psychiatric consultation one day and told her about my  lost weekends.  where I did nothing but binge and purge. How I was afraid to leave my house to go anywhere other than work. Piggly Wiggly and home. I was always a little fearful of driving. but by the time I sat in her office. I was avoiding all major roads. using a giant paper map to navigate back roads because GPS didn t exist yet.My world got smaller and smaller. I knew I couldn t stay in Dallas. but the idea of moving home was just as bad. Nowhere felt safe. She didn t know much about bulimia. but after I told her about the ipecac and laxatives. she said.  I m worried you re not safe.  I was too! But I was even more worried about what my parents would think if they knew about my big. disgusting secret. I agreed to let her call them. but only if she promised to say I was depressed. That wasn t a lie. Just not the whole truth. My family was used to lies and half-truths. What was one more?Going to the psych ward for  depression  was a compromise I was comfortable with. I was too ashamed of anyone knowing my secret and there was a lack of resources to deal with it. but I also wasn t ready to give up my only solution to all my problems. If I m being totally honest with myself. I was afraid the truth might lead to people taking my eating disorder away. I desperately clung to it despite being so distraught by it because it felt like there was no alternative. How else does anyone cope with life?We now know more about the root of eating disorders and how to manage them effectively. But this was the  80s. People were just starting to gain awareness of their existence and how to treat them. Today there are therapists who specialize in eating disorders and resources full of information like the National Eating Disorders Association. Eating Disorder Hope and Gurze. There are countless books and treatment centers with differing levels of care including inpatient. outpatient and partial treatment. Some treatment centers. for example. have IV treatment. walking restrictions (or even wheelchairs for critical cases). weight check-in. monitored meals. and locked bathrooms to protect severely sick patients from hurting themselves more. They also include the use of dietitians. meds when needed. and group. cognitive behavior and/or individual therapy. They help with body dysmorphia and negative body image. and they teach patients coping mechanisms like meditation. art therapy and journaling. The field has come a long way since the  80s!If I d had these kinds of options back then and had known I wasn t the only one suffering from bulimia. I might have been open to getting help with it. But. at the time. my only choices were to move home. possibly die in Dallas. or check myself into a psych ward. Off to the psych ward I went!At the hospital. they just threw everyone struggling with their mental health on one floor together. Some were young. but most were elderly. Some were in straitjackets. The community room TV was always on in the background. I ll always associate  The Price Is Right and  General Hospital with the psych ward. In the psych ward. conversations were rare. even with the very people who were supposed to help. I don t remember if I even had a therapist assigned to me. and my doctor knew absolutely nothing about eating disorders.There are only two things I remember explicitly about those six weeks: staring at the hallway vending machine and riding my beloved stationary bike. No one else seemed interested in aerobic exercise. so this one piece of gym equipment in an empty  exercise room  was all mine. Still. I wasn t binging or purging anymore. just exercising (a little too much). Here in the hospital. I could just sleep. stare at the vending machine. and ride my stationary bike. I got a break from the violence and shame of purging and I didn t have to pretend to be happy. wear makeup. or act like I was an adult who knew what she was doing. It wasn t Club Med. but it was a place that made me feel safe and protected from myself. That ended almost as soon as I got out of the psych ward and I fell back on old routines: binge. purge. sleep. repeat. After all. I hadn t received any treatment for my eating disorder or learned any coping mechanisms on how to deal with the real world without it. So. I spent all my spare time on the couch watching  General Hospital  while shoving anything and everything down my throat. One night during a binge that seemed likely to keep going beyond Letterman. the leading news story stopped me in my chewing … and maybe changed my life forever. The singer Karen Carpenter had suffered a cardiac arrest because of an eating disorder and died.I couldn t believe it! One of the most famous singers of my generation was battling the same thing I was? I always knew what I was doing could kill me. but her tragic ending turned my casual fear into a real possibility. It was just the shock I needed to scare me out of my delusion.It also comforted me in a weird way. It wasn t just me who did this. And people on TV were talking about it! Women had been dealing with eating disorders for generations. Because they were never diagnosed. they often unknowingly passed down these disordered eating behaviors to their daughters. Thankfully. once we started to talk about it. intervention and treatment could happen sooner and more aggressively.Not long after that moment. binging on my own couch alone. I was a patient on my new therapist s couch (finally one who actually knew about eating disorders!). I could finally talk openly to someone about this thing I did. Over the next 10 years. she tolerated my messiness and slow progress. Recovery from eating disorders can take time. because unlike with alcohol or drug addiction. you can t cut them out entirely. You still have to eat and have a relationship with food.In the beginning. I learned about myself. that I wasn t crazy. and that my feelings just needed to be felt. Writing and talking helped delay urges until they passed. Once my symptoms were managed. the real work began — unpacking my struggles. my feelings. old belief systems and my family secrets. Even my visit to the psych ward itself was a family secret.This pivotal day on my sweet therapist s couch was the beginning of my long road to recovery. I credit her for not only helping save my life but inspiring me to help others. I dedicated the rest of my professional life to paying it forward. For over 25 years. I ve had a private psychotherapy practice treating people with eating disorders.Until just recently. I d only told my close family and friends about my eating disorder. never sharing it with my patients and certainly not with my community (or Facebook!). I didn t see the point of dredging up something I d put behind me. Recently. though. I ve realized the power of my own storytelling. As a therapist. I am painfully aware that secrecy is rooted in shame. And shame is at the heart of eating disorders. In talking about it. I ve finally let go of my own shame. And now. in my early 60s. I m going against what my generation was taught to do — keep our secrets to ourselves. Thankfully. the world we live in now has ample support to help people like my younger self. instead of just psych wards. Maybe my story will inspire others to feel less alone and to reach out for the kind of help my generation didn t know we even needed.Maureen Kritzer-Lange MSW.

Check out more stories from Busted. our series that offers an unfiltered exploration and celebration of our boobs and ourselves during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Millions of people get breast biopsies every year. and yet the ins and outs of the procedure are seldom openly discussed.Breast biopsies help doctors diagnose different types of breast lumps and lesions. If your radiologist can t immediately rule out cancer based on the imaging tests. they ll most likely recommend a breast biopsy to get a sample of the tissue and take a closer look under a microscope.Past research has shown that most people find the breast biopsy experience at least a little distressing. It s understandable — after all. you re waiting on results that could drastically alter the course of your life. But a recent report found that nearly 82% of people who were worried about getting a breast biopsy said after the fact that the procedure was better than they expected.By reading up and preparing for the procedure — and. perhaps. practicing some mindfulness along the way — your breast biopsy journey can become a little less frightening. After all. breast biopsies are safe. reliable procedures that can give you some much-needed answers and kick-start your treatment plan if need be.Here s what to know and what to expect when you need to get a breast biopsy:If somebody has a symptom involving their breasts — whether it s a lump or persistent pain — they ll likely undergo imaging (think: an ultrasound or mammogram) so their doctor can get a closer look at what might be causing the issue.If the imaging tests come back abnormal. your physician may recommend that you get a breast biopsy to obtain a clearer diagnosis. During a breast biopsy. a small needle is inserted into the breast to collect a sample of tissue. That tissue is then evaluated under a microscope to determine whether an abnormal growth or lesion detected on imaging tests is cancer. You re not sedated during a breast biopsy. but a local anesthetic. lidocaine. is used to numb the area where the needle is inserted.According to Dr. Andrea Abbott. an assistant professor at Temple Health s Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. lidocaine is the same type of numbing medicine that your dentist would use.  It can burn when it is being injected. but this sensation should go away quickly.  Abbott said.There are three types of breast biopsies. and the type you get largely depends on the imaging device where the lesion showed up.The first type is a stereotactic biopsy. which doctors conduct while using a mammogram to see where the growth is. The breast is numbed and put in compression. which can be pretty uncomfortable. Dr. Janie Grumleya breast surgical oncologist and director of the Margie Petersen Breast Center at Providence Saint John s Center in Santa Monica. California. She explained that a stereotactic biopsy is basically like getting a mammogram that lasts for 20 to 30 minutes. Occasionally. the biopsy needle can hit a blood vessel in the breast and cause some minor bleeding.There are also ultrasound-guided biopsies. which are more commonly performed in women with dense breasts. The patient lies on their back while an ultrasound probe is used to detect where the lesion is. The skin is numbed. then the needle is inserted to collect the sample. Because the needle used in this type of biopsy is smaller. it s less common for it to hit a blood vessel — but it can happen. according to Grumley.The third type is an MRI-guided biopsy. This is recommended for patients who have a lesion that is only visible on an MRI.  It s a bit more involved. the breast does have to be held still during the biopsy. and [the patient] is coming in and out of the MRI machine.  Grumley said.Though the numbing medicine helps prevent sharp. shooting pains. some patients still feel pressure and vibrations.  I always tell patients that everyone reacts to the numbing medicine differently. so it s important to communicate with your doctor during the biopsy if you feel anything.  Abbott said.It usually takes 24 to 48 hours to get your breast biopsy results. but at some centers it could take up to five days or so. Grumley said results aren t given immediately because breast tissue. which is fatty. needs to be fixed — a chemical process that prepares the tissue for inspection.The results come in three categories: benign (which involves normal changes in the breast). cancer. and risk lesion (something that looks abnormal but doesn t seem to be cancer). If cancer is detected. the breast biopsy will give insights as to the type of cancer it is and the treatment methods it will best respond to.  It could really help guide somebody when it comes to treating a breast cancer.  Grumley said. Biopsy results cannot tell you what stage the cancer is. according to Abbott. If risk lesions are detected. you will likely be referred to a surgeon who can do a small surgical procedure to collect more tissue and confirm whether there is cancer in the breast.In certain cases. patients may need to get another biopsy. Occasionally. the mammogram results and biopsy results don t fully add up. and more tests are needed to figure out what s going on. The radiologist (who handles the imaging results) and the pathologist (who evaluates the biopsy) always review and compare their findings.  The two have to have that discussion to make sure that what they re seeing under a microscope makes sense to what they re seeing on imaging.  Grumley said.Most breast biopsies come back as benign. or as a risk lesion that ends up being benign. In fact. only about 10% of breast biopsies turn out to be cancers. according to Grumley.It s natural to feel some anxiety about getting a breast biopsy. Anxiety feeds off of the unknown. and there s no shortage of unknowns when you re searching for a medical diagnosis.  This is a completely normal response to an unknown procedure and to the possibility of the biopsy resulting in a cancer diagnosis.  Abbott said.Research has found that mindfulness. or the practice of being in the present moment. can help patients relax before getting a breast biopsy. If permitted. musiccan also help calm your nerves during the procedure.Grumley recommends talking to your radiologist. since they can. in a way. prepare you for any answer based on clues from your imaging tests. Jot down any questions you have and ask your doctor about the procedure so you have a clearer idea of what to expect going into it.  Once you learn about that process. it s less scary.  Grumley said. ,Health News
I first felt the dull pang in my head on a Wednesday in mid-July 2021. I didn t think much of it. because like most people. I m used to having the occasional headache ― usually from PMS or not drinking enough water. I popped an Advil. took a test to rule out COVID. and continued about my day. That weekend. I still had a headache but. nevertheless. took a pre-planned trip to visit a friend in New York City. I stowed a big bottle of extra-strength Tylenol in my backpack and hopped on my flight. The visit was great. but I found myself taking pain relievers twice a day in order to lessen the ache and feel as much like my usual self as possible. I flew back home to Detroit two days later and pushed on with my week. Still. the pain in my head remained.My naturally anxious and analytical mind began questioning why this might be happening. Was it stress? I was a recent grad living at home. I was working a job I hated. my house was in disarray from a bad flood the previous month. and the pandemic was still raging on. I wondered if the combined pressures might be enough to push my body over the edge. I convinced myself this was the case ― until I also started feeling dizzy and seeing spots.I scheduled a doctor s appointment for the following week. By then. a pulsing whoosh in my ear had begun. and my for-driving-only glasses had become a permanent fixture on my face to combat my spotty vision. I saw a new doctor at my regular clinic. and while she listened to me thoughtfully as I described my ailments. she also noted the history of anxiety and depression on my chart. Taking all of this into account. she told me she suspected I had a tension headache. I was prescribed muscle relaxers and instructed to keep a headache journal to track possible triggers. Then a nurse came in to flush my ears out with water. a particularly nauseating experience that did nothing to alleviate the tinnitus.Due to my trust in doctors and because my anxiety often did contribute to extreme tension in my upper body. I went home believing that it would all be over soon. Being the proactive overachiever I am. I even booked a myofascial release massage with my grandmother s favorite masseuse in hopes of relieving every ounce of tension in my body. I remember lying face down on that table in the dark. incense-filled room as I explained to the masseuse that the doctor thought my anxiety was causing my head pain. She was quick to agree. assuring me that the answer to the tension she was attempting to knead out of my body was  relaxing more.  Genius.I left the appointment feeling sweaty and disheveled but the pounding in my head was still there. I started spending my evenings with an ice pack wrapped around my head. Things took a sharp turn 2.5 weeks into my unrelenting pain. My mom asked if I wanted to take a trip to the mall. but as soon as we hit the highway. a wave of nausea quickly rose inside of me. I reclined the passenger seat as far back as it could go. closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathing with laser-sharp focus. I feared if I opened my eyes even a sliver. I would throw up all over her car.The nausea must have been a forewarning of worse things to come. The next morning. I woke up early to run an errand and. during the six-block drive from my house to my destination. realized I couldn t see. It wasn t that everything was dark. but more so that I no longer had any depth perception. I could see the houses on either side of the street. but my vision folded in the middle. leaving me unable to see the road. It was like I was trying to read a book. but all of the words were printed in the crease where the binding is centered. I was unable to see where I was going. I discovered the only way I could regain clarity was by closing one eye. so I drove that way for all six blocks there and back. Surprisingly. this was the first time amid all of the symptoms that I felt genuinely scared ― it was now obvious something was very wrong and this wasn t just simply a stress-related issue.I went back to the doctor the next day and explained the frightening new development. She couldn t give me any concrete answers. but she did order an MRI. When I called to make an appointment. they told me the earliest they could get me in was two weeks later at an office an hour away (thank you. American health care system!). I lay awake that night tortured by the pounding and the whooshing. I was even tempted to endure the chaos of the emergency room if it meant this would all be over. I wept on a telehealth appointment with my therapist that week. frustrated that I had no concrete answers for my unending nightmare and terrified as my mind raced with the worst-case scenarios. Everyone in my life offered well-meaning advice to stay calm and positive. but they couldn t feel the panic permeating every cell in my body.GoogleI could check off every symptom listed on the page. and was especially convinced that I d found a plausible explanation when one of them was  a whooshing sound in your head that pulses with your heartbeat.  There weren t very many causes offered. but it said that the use of tetracyclines could contribute. I quickly Googled examples of tetracyclines and bingo! There was the name of a medication I had been taking for four months: doxycycline. an antibiotic prescribed by my dermatologist to treat my acne. I immediately felt a rush of relief and self-assurance. I had been right to feel fear and panic. and giving in to my anxiety had provided me with an answer that no doctor had been able to offer thus far.I told my parents about my revelation. which they met with hesitation (understandable. as I lack a medical degree and my only evidence was my internet self-diagnosis). However. my dad called an ophthalmologist friend. who agreed that it sounded like a pseudotumor. I also called my dermatologist s office. which advised me to stop taking the doxycycline just in case. My sister came home from summer camp that weekend. and she was the first person to outwardly meet me at the level of concern that I was feeling inside. She immediately pointed out that when I thought I was looking her in the eye while talking to her. my eyes were actually focused in a completely different direction. Scary.Coincidentally. I had my yearly eye exam scheduled a few days later. I was quickly passed off from my optometrist to an ophthalmologist. who showed me my retinal imaging full of dark. ominous-looking spots surrounding my optic nerve (which was also hemorrhaging due to the pressure) ― a clear diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. The office called ahead to the emergency room. where I was admitted as an inpatient to receive a CT scan and MRI. I started crying at the suggestion that I might have to receive a spinal tap in order to relieve fluid. but later found out that because I stopped taking doxycycline a few days prior. this could be avoided. Another win for my intuition.Oddly enough. the night I spent in the hospital was the most restful sleep I d had in weeks. despite being frequently woken up to get my vitals taken. I felt like Sylvia Plath. the old brag of my heart reassuring myself.  I was right. I was right. I was right.  I was released from the hospital the next day with orders to follow up with my ophthalmologist and to check in with a neurologist. and I spent the better part of the next year seeing them on a regular basis in order to ensure the fluid fully dispersed. I also went back to my dermatologist to tell her what had happened. but she frankly could not have cared less about what I went through. I haven t been back there since.Pseudotumor cerebri can cause permanent vision loss if not treated quickly enough. which terrified me at the time. Luckily. my eyes have gone back to normal for the most part. However. now when I go to the eye doctor for routine check-ups. I notice that the letters they put on the wall collapse in the middle of my vision. I can see the two letters on either side of the center. but the fifth one disappears into the middle. a new blind spot I have as a result of my former condition.I was lucky that my condition could be traced back to a medication I was taking. This meant that for me. recovery only required stopping the doxycycline and taking a new medicine. diamox. which decreases the rate at which spinal fluid is produced. for six months. However. in most other cases. this condition doesn t have a clear cause ― or a guarantee that medication or surgery will cure it. I m not quite sure what it means for me. or whether my condition will resurface in any way in the future. so I m committed to monitoring it with regular check-ins with my doctors. I have spent much of my life convinced my anxiety was my downfall. and I worked to minimize and mitigate it as much as possible to maintain any sense of normalcy on my surface. I had never considered that leaning into it would be more helpful than hiding it would ever be. Aside from learning that sometimes anxiety can be an asset ― a useful signal that something is truly wrong and needs to be addressed ― I ve also discovered that doctors don t always get it right. They re susceptible to human error. which means they might be missing something that s right in front of them. Sometimes it s up to us to take the situation into our own hands. Maybe that means speaking up and pushing harder when our doctor offers a solution that feels wrong. Maybe that means getting a second or third or fourth opinion. Or maybe it means doing our own research and seeing if anything fits. Regardless. we know ourselves best and have to do whatever we need to do to get the care we deserve ― especially in a country where doctors are overworked. women are often susceptible to gender discrimination in medical treatment. and too many people don t have access to the care they need in the first place.Along with my blind spot. the thumping in my ear remains. an artifact from this journey that will not seem to go away. It s not constant. but it happens often enough to be disturbing. I ve noticed that it tends to be aligned with my anxiety. the intensity of the whooshing increasing and decreasing with the ebb and flow of my internal mental health landscape. My medical trauma is forever intertwined with the facet of my mind that ultimately saved me. Ironic. isn t it?Alexandra Niforos is the operations associate for HuffPost and BuzzFeed News.

new research from ScotlandA study published Wednesday in the Nature Communications journal followed 33.281 people with recent COVID-19 infections. as well as a control group of 62.957 people who had never been infected. to determine what symptoms were most associated with long COVID-19. This way. vague symptoms that are often dismissed ― like  brain fog  or confusion ― could be more definitively linked to long COVID.brain foghas also foundThe study also showed that vaccination may be linked to a lower risk of long COVID and was specifically connected with a reduced risk of developing seven of the 26 tracked symptoms.Dr. Andrew SchamessWhile participants in the Scottish study were less likely to deal with long COVID if they were vaccinated and asymptomatic. developing the condition is still possible — and COVID-19 is an ever-changing and unpredictable virus. You may be vaccinated. you may get a mild infection [and] you could still wind up with your life completely turned upside down by long COVID.  said Schamess. who was not involved with the new research.In a particularly grim finding. the study discovered that 6% of infected participants had not recovered from COVID-19 at all. while 42% reported partial recovery six to 18 months after infection. Additionally. older adults. women and people with economic challenges were more likely to suffer from long COVID symptoms.It s worth noting that 91% of study participants were white. so further research is needed to determine the exact impact on other communities. According to Schamess. long COVID has two definitions. First. the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that symptoms lasting for a month or more can indicate long COVID. That said. a lot of people may need a month to fully recover from COVID-19. according to Schamess. Just think of all of the people you know (maybe including yourself) who had trouble getting back to working out or had a lingering cough for weeks after infection. I think the better definition to me is the World Health Organization s. which sets three months as the mark  for long COVID. he said. While certain factors may put you at higher risk of developing long COVID. you can take some steps to protect yourself.bivalent shotNext. if you do get sick. make a treatment plan with your doctor. Treatments like Paxlovid and short-acting monoclonal antibodies are available for some people. Schamess noted. new data suggestsantibody treatmentsLastly. be sure to still take precautions like mask-wearing in crowded indoor spaces. I do think this is going to be the hidden aftermath of the pandemic.  Schamess said of long COVID. While we re seeing less immediate death and people in the [intensive care unit] ... I think as long as COVID is circulating. we are going to see these cases of long COVID. which can be utterly disabling. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication. but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

walkingBut if you re someone who counts on their walk for fitness or a mental health boost. there are still ways to get in some steps while staying warm and safe at home (or within other spaces).Here. experts share how to get in a meaningful walk (or other low-intensity exercise) in the chilly months:Dr. Aaron Baggishrofessor of medicine at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. What I typically tell people is to find either a loop within the house that goes through consecutive rooms or the longest straight distance. which is usually a hallway.  Baggish said.can You can get a good 20-to-30-minute walk just in your house without going anywhere.  Baggish said.If you live in a home with multiple levels. you can walk up and down the stairs as a way to get moving.  Stair-walking is a great exercise.  said Catherine Hagan Vargo. a physical therapist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.As far as how many times you need to climb them. that s up to you. she added.If you get fatigued walking up and down one flight upstairs. that s enough for now.  Vargo said. But if you find that one time isn t hard enough for you. bump it up to two or three.Vargo noted that while you don t want to push yourself too much. you do want to make this exercise challenging — and you should build on it. too. If you eventually are able to walk up and down the stairs twice with no issue. increase your reps from there.Sweat DC They utilize your core. your arms. your legs.  he said. adding that these  are great two-for-one activities ― you get to clean up and get your body moving. The National Institute on Aging even categorizesaccording to Cleveland ClinicIf you are used to physical activity. you re probably fine. But if not. it s best to break up your shoveling throughout the day. That way. you can still get the benefits without the risk. If you re ever unsure. chat with your doctor.If you are one of the many people who do not have enough room for a walk inside their homes. try another indoor space instead. There s an amazing resource that many people have at their disposal that they overlook. and that is the use of shopping malls or shopping centers.  Baggish said. Malls have a huge amount of indoor space that you can use to get in your steps during the winter. and many open their doors before the stores do. Baggish said that you can head to the mall early for your walk so that it s less busy and you aren t tempted to shop. He even recommended leaving your wallet at home. You can get as long a walk as you want. cover a lot of distance [and] even go up and down stairs.  he said.Baggish added that the same can be done at a large grocery store. You can visit the store during its off hours and walk some laps through the aisles.is great for people with balance or mobility issues.  Baggish said.  Grab yourself a shopping cart and push that around for 20 minutes. and get in a great workout in a safe environment.  dance party in the house is a fantastic way to get some steps. some movement [and] some cardio.  Vargo said.a great destressor.  she said.  It s great for mental health. and it s great for physical health. In fact. research shows that moderate-intensity dance has been linked with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Plus. dancing is just a way to get moving if you re not someone who typically looks forward to a traditional workout.Those who work in an office can add to their daily step count by using a printer or a water bottle refill station that is somewhat far away. Vargo said. While it may not seem like an extra minute on your feet amounts to much. these small changes can actually add up to a real difference at the end of the week or month.Burley. of Sweat DC. suggested leaning on co-workers to help you stay accountable during the workday. That can mean setting up a group text for everyone to check in on their movement goals or picking a specific time for a group walk on the office stairs. The key now is to be intentional about [movement].  Burley said.You can try setting a timer or using the natural transitions within your day — like the end of a meeting or when you have gone through all your unread emails — to remind yourself to get up. During those breaks from sitting. you can move around for a bit however you like. whether that s doing jumping jacks. going for a short walk or doing some squats.Not only is moving around good for your physical health. but  it s also proven that the energy helps you [be] a little bit sharper mentally.  Burley said.Baggish noted that while walking outdoors in the fall and winter may be more challenging because of earlier sunsets and colder weather. it is certainly still a reasonable thing to do.  It s not harmful for the body to walk in cold air. assuming [you re] wearing an appropriate jacket.  he said. The only cause for concern comes from slippery surfaces as a result of snow or ice. To help prepare for this. make sure you re wearing shoes with some form of tread that can give you a proper grip. Baggish said. (It s also important to keep safety in mind. so try to walk during daylight hours when possible.) If [you] have any tendency of being imbalanced or at a fall risk. strongly consider using something to support [yourself] whether it s walking sticks or a cane.  he added.Nordic walkingGetting in your weekly movement should be done year-round. but it may just take a little more creativity during the colder months.

KANSAS CITY. Mo. (AP) — Denny Dalliance had long worried about what would happen if he fathered a child because his job as a truck driver keeps him away from home most of the week.overturned Roe v. Wade These are grim circumstances under which I made this decision.  he said as he drove a load of cardboard boxes through Kansas this week.Planned ParenthoodDr. Esgar Guarin then plans to take his mobile clinic — a vehicle decorated with large images of sperm that his friends have jokingly dubbed the  Nutcracker  — on the road the following week to offer 40 more free vasectomies in several towns across Iowa.Guarin also plans to offer discounted vasectomies that month at his regular clinic in the Des Moines area.The efforts are part of World Vasectomy Day. originally a single-day event that now includes a year-round focus and a host of activities in November. It s a very particular moment in reproductive rights in the United States. And we need to talk about it.  he said. adding that vasectomies are performed far less often than the tubal ligation method of female sterilization. even though they are cheaper. have a shorter recovery time and require local. rather than general. anesthesia.Guarin. who serves on the medical advisory board for the World Vasectomy Day. helped offer vasectomies last year at the Planned Parenthood in St. Louis to raise awareness about the procedure. The effort was so popular that the decision was made to expand it to other cities even before the toppling of Roe sent demand soaring.In July alone. Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri performed 42 vasectomies. compared with 10 in the same month last year. Female sterilizations rose to 18 that month from just three in July 2021.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been hearing similar reports from across the country that more patients are seeking tubal ligations. It is too early for any post-Roe national numbers on permanent sterilization. said Laura Lindberg. a professor at Rutgers University s School of Public Health in New Jersey.Planned Parenthood. for instance. doesn t have national sterilization numbers available for this year yet. However. its national web page has seen a 53% increase in vasectomy information searches over the past 100 days. a spokesperson said.GoogleDr. Doug Stein. a urological surgeon in the Tampa-St. Petersburg. Florida. area. said patient registrations for his practice tripled immediately after the Dobbs decision. with many patients under the age of 30. I think everybody is busier since the Dobbs decision.  said Stein. who co-founded World Vasectomy Day.Dr. Arnold Bullock. a St. Louis urologist who does about 35 vasectomies a month said that before the Supreme Court decision. patients waited about a month for the procedure while the wait now is two to three months.In Texas. Dr. Koushik Shaw said his Austin Urology Institute saw a spike when state enacted a strict abortion law last year and another. larger one after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. so that it s now doing 50% more procedures. He said many are for men who don t want children and saw access to abortion as another option should birth control not work as planned. It really pushed family planning to the forefront of people s thoughts.  he said of the loss of abortion access.Lawmakers are responding to the growing demand. A California law that will take effect in 2024 will make vasectomies cheaper by allowing patients with private insurance plans to get the procedure at no additional cost other than what they pay for their monthly premiums.Dr. Margaret Baum. the medical director of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. will be partnering with Guarin to provide the free vasectomies. She has had many conversations with patients about permanent sterilization in recent months and said there is a sense of urgency. I think people are afraid. No. 1. about abortion not being accessible. which is a very real and legitimate fear and in the reality for a large part of folks in our country. And then I think people are also really afraid that what else might be next.  she said.A vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the tube that carries sperm. preventing it from entering ejaculate fluid. Baum said she chats with patients to keep them calm. sometimes turning on a playlist that includes  Great Balls of Fire  and  The Nutcracker Suite.  Most patients are fully recovered in a couple of days.Dalliance. the truck driver. said he didn t want to thrust the responsibility of birth control on partners anymore. especially with abortions harder to get. His home state of Missouri was among the first in the country with a trigger law in effect to ban abortions at any point in pregnancy. I don t want to come off as though I m like unhappy to be doing this. but this is a situation where my hand kind of got forced with regards to the Roe v. Wade decision.  he said. I feel like that. with the extreme cost involved with having a child in the United States. I kind of got priced out.  he said.  And so this is me cashing out my chips as it were. It s the right ethical decision for me. but it s not one that s made lightly. ___Associated Press writer Hanna reported from Topeka. Kansas.

It s that time of year: Pumpkins and skeletons adorn lawns and stoops. costumes are being ordered and assembled. and kids are already plotting trick-or-treating routes that will bring them the biggest haul.Halloween season is upon us. with bags of candy lining grocery store shelves and bowls of miniature candy bars popping up along receptionists  desks. We re surrounded by sweet treats well before the 31st. when comments about  too much sugar.   being bad  and  cheating  reach their peak.How many of us have heard someone say they buy their least favorite Halloween candy to hand out to trick-or-treaters so they won t be tempted to eat it all themselves? Our kids are hearing all of this. too.does The days leading up to Halloween offer us a chance to choose our words mindfully and allow our kids to experience different foods with joy instead of anxiety — perhaps in a way that we didn t get to ourselves at their age.Below. experts offer tips about how to frame this sweets-centered celebration in a way that will help kids have fun and maintain a healthy relationship with food.No matter the time of year. use terms that are value-neutral when you talk about candy — or any other food. Chocolate bars aren t conniving. Kale isn t virtuous.Alexandra Altman. a therapist in Maryland who specializes in issues related to food and eating. advises against talking about candy with words like  bad  and  evil.  This can shame kids for loving candy and really moralizes it. when the truth is it s just a food that happens to have sugar in it.  Altman said.  The more power we give it. the more our kids tend to obsess over it or feel guilty for wanting or eating it. Ideally. kids will approach any food with curiosity. instead of thinking of it as  bad  or  good. nutrition.for.littles In the end. we want to raise conscious eaters. who know how foods affect their body and how to eat all foods in a way that makes them feel good.  she continued.We can model this by saying things like.  All foods do something for our bodies. Candy is sweet and gives us quick energy. Let s pick out some of our favorite pieces to have with our dinner tonight.  Miller suggested.If you need to pick through the loot to remove allergens or choking hazards. she recommended the phrase.  Let s look through and take out anything that isn t safe for our bodies. And rather than warning them that they ll be sick if they eat one more Twizzler. Miller suggested being honest and using our own experiences to help them make connections about the effect different foods have on their bodies.You might say.  My belly gets a little upset when I eat too much candy. I think I ll have a few tonight and save some for another day.  she said. Unapologetic Eating Asking questions like ‘How does the candy taste?  or ‘How does your tummy feel?  — without any expectation of it changing their eating decision right then — can help kids begin to identify their body sensations and notice how certain foods make them feel.  Rumsey said.  This can naturally help them self-regulate over time. Talking about the positives. such as your own favorite childhood candies. is another way to connect with your kids around the holiday.  Sweets and desserts help form memories and feelings of comfort.  Miller explained.  This makes sense because our bodies feel safe when there s plenty of quick energy available. Rumsey advised against bargaining using other foods. as in:  You can have candy if you finish your dinner.  This reinforces disconnected eating. and elevates certain foods as ‘good  and others as ‘bad  or ‘forbidden.   she said. Sarah HerstichSuch talk can lead to  guilt and shame during and after eating experiences with these food groups.  Herstich said.While your kids likely won t notice how many pieces you eat — unless you re stealing them right from their bucket — they will hear your self-judgment in phrases like.  I shouldn t be eating this.   I m being bad tonight  or  I m going to have to go to the gym tomorrow.  They may internalize what they hear and begin thinking those thoughts about their own body. Probably not. it turns out.  If kids are taught to think about candy from a neutral perspective. they will generally lose interest in it after a few days.  Rumsey said. Herstich noted that  allowing our kids to experience feeling overly full  is part of helping them  get to know their bodies and what feels good.  Experts warned against hiding candy. throwing it out. or otherwise being restrictive about it. If kids know the candy will still be there for them tomorrow. they ll feel less of a need to eat it all on Halloween night. I can t tell you how many moms tell me when they were kids they weren t allowed to eat their Halloween candy. or their parents dumped it all in the trash. and now as parents. they can t stop eating it when they buy it for trick or treaters or out of their kid s bags after bedtime.  Miller said. Altman agreed that this kind of restriction can backfire. Parents tend to get so caught up in the idea of trying to control their kids  food and candy consumption around a holiday like Halloween. and while their intentions may be good. this type of food policing typically only tends to drive food and candy obsession and fixation in children.  she said.  In my experience — and with all of the clients I see who struggle with eating disorders — this leads to kids feeling cheated and frustrated. and makes them more likely to hide or hoard candy.  Altman continued.Adults often experience the same thing when they go on restrictive diets. longing to indulge in precisely the thing they aren t supposed to eat. Rumsey noted. This is biological — we are wired to react to any type of restriction with increased cravings and binge/binge-like behavior.  she said. Many parents worry that if they give their kids free-range to eat candy. that they ll only ever choose sweets when given the opportunity.  Rumsey added.  But actually. the research shows the opposite — kids who are given access to a variety of food. including candy. end up naturally responding to their intuitive body cues and eat a variety of foods including fruits. vegetables. grains. protein. and sweets. Candy — even in huge quantities — won t hurt our kids. But fat-shaming and negative body talk will.  Parents have a lot of power in terms of influencing how their kids  feel about food and their body.  Altman said.  The ways we talk about food and bodies and weight and appearance growing up can plant seeds for years to come. ,Health News
WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Social Security recipients will get an 8.7% boost in their benefits in 2023.That s a historic increase and welcome news for American retirees and others — but it s tempered by the fact that it s fueled by record high inflation that s raised the cost of everyday living.cost-of living adjustment3% drop in Medicare Part B premiums This year s substantial Social Security cost-of-living adjustment is the first time in over a decade that Medicare premiums are not rising and shows that we can provide more support to older Americans who count on the benefits they have earned.  said Social Security Administration s Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijakaz.a separate government report showed inflation newly acceleratingStock futures declined before U.S. markets opened.midterm electionsPresident Joe Biden has pledged to protect both Social Security and Medicare.

The maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes for 2023 is $160.200.The financing setup dates to the 1930s. the brainchild of President Franklin D.

Republican-backed abortion banblocked the law a week after it took effect.Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced. writing that  there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution  and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit.The ban was approved by the state s Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June.their decision.The Indiana ban aimed to replace state laws that generally prohibited abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and tightly restricted them after the 13th week. The ban includes exceptions allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest. before 10 weeks post-fertilization. to protect the life and physical health of the mother. and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly.lose their state licenses under the banAmy Hagstrom Miller. president of Whole Woman s Health. said its South Bend clinic will likely resume appointments for abortion patients next week. Since the injunction was issued Sept. 22. the clinic has been able to replace staff members it lost after the ban took effect. That includes doctors who do the abortions. some of whom are now available to see patients through November. she said. That is some stability and security for the patients that we haven t had in quite some time.  Hagstrom Miller told The Associated Press.filed the lawsuit Aug. 31arguing before the county judgeThe state attorney general s office said the court should uphold the ban. saying arguments against it are based on a  novel. unwritten. historically unsupported right to abortion  in the state constitution.The attorney general s office had asked the Supreme Court to take over the case. bypassing the typical intermediate step of it being considered by the state appeals court.The ACLU and the state attorney general s office did not immediately comment on the decision.The leader of Indiana s most prominent anti-abortion group said it was  deeply disappointed  and estimated that at least 3.000 abortions will take place in the state while awaiting a decision from the court. Although we are confident the law will be upheld. it will be far too late for those whose lives will be lost as this is argued in the courts.  Indiana Right to Life CEO Mike Fichter said in a statement.political firestorm over a 10-year-old rape victimblocked that state s lawpre-statehood Arizona law blockedThe question of whether the Indiana Constitution protects abortion rights is undecided.A state appeals court decision in 2004 said privacy was a core value under the state constitution that extended to all residents. including women seeking abortions. But the Indiana Supreme Court later set aside that ruling without addressing whether the state constitution included such a right.Hanlon. a Republican who was first elected in 2014 as a judge in the rural southern Indiana county. wrote in her injunction order that Indiana s constitution  is more explicit in its affirmation of individual rights and its limitation of legislative power to intrude into personal affairs  than the U.S. Constitution.__Report for Americahttps://twitter.com/arleighrodgers,Health News

Something s wrong.That was my first thought when I woke up on Wednesday. May 11. 2022. A wave of nausea was sweeping across me as I got myself out of bed. I almost doubled over from the crippling pain in my lower abdomen.I d been weeks late for my period. way over a month. But this wasn t completely abnormal for me. Stress has always affected my cycle. When I first went into foster care as a teenager. my period stopped for over three months. At 25. my period hadn t gotten any less irregular.Work had been busy. and I was on pretty intense medication for my newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. Perhaps this had affected my cycle. or maybe work was getting to me more than I realized. I considered every possible option apart from the most obvious.Limping to the bathroom. the agony in my lower abdomen felt different from the usual dull ache of my period. Sitting down on the toilet. a congealed dark stringy mess oozed out of me. I would later learn to assign words like  tissue.   blood clots  and  gestational sac  to the mess that was leaving my body.I scrunched up into a little ball. moving myself from the toilet to a shuddering shell on the tiled bathroom floor. My vision blurred as I attempted to type out an  I ve got a stomach bug and can t come into work today  message to my manager.But it wasn t a stomach bug. and it wasn t a very late period. It was a miscarriage.Looking back. there had been signs I was pregnant. Signs I ignored. The nausea. the mood swings. and the sudden obsession with olives after a lifetime of detesting them. Then there was the disappearance of my appetite. In the couple of days leading up to the events of that Wednesday. I d completely stopped eating.But my boyfriend of two years and I were always safe. sensible. sexually aware. The idea that I could be weeks pregnant was unfathomable. But five days later. my cramps hadn t stopped. They were less intense. but were still coming in waves. refusing to let me forget the events of that morning on the bathroom floor. After calling an emergency line. I went with my boyfriend to the ER at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night. The operator had told us to get to a hospital as soon as possible.I was hooked up to an IV when I arrived and given morphine followed by paracetamol to help with the pain I was experiencing. After a cold and exhausting 13-hour wait in a hospital corridor with no sleep. I finally saw a doctor at 11 a.m. the next day. My boyfriend had had to leave to go to work. so I was alone when the female gynecologist ushered me. exhausted and disorientated from the morphine and other drugs. into a private room.The moment she said the words.  You ve had a miscarriage  will stay with me forever.People talk about  time freezing  in these moments. but I never really understood what they meant until then. I can remember the color of the tissue box she handed me. the smell of the room. the unevenness of the curtains. and the metallic taste of my mouth. It was like someone had pressed a pause button.Then all of a sudden someone hit  play  and I was told I could leave. It felt wrong to be walking out of the hospital on my own after almost 13 hours. I was just expected to step back into day-to-day life and live with the fact that I d been pregnant without even knowing it. And now I wasn t.I texted my boyfriend when I left the hospital just after midday. telling him I d had a miscarriage. A one-word reply of  fuck  came back within a minute. This was followed by a worried.  How are you feeling?  I couldn t think what to respond.I went back to work the very next day. All I wanted to do was pretend like the last five days hadn t happened. I felt numb and empty. Over the following months. I wrestled with the question.  How do you mourn something you never had the chance to acknowledge existed? As I began to open up to friends and colleagues. I soon learned that everyone had an opinion on how I should be feeling. But I also quickly learned that I didn t necessarily feel the way they wanted me to. In fact. I didn t feel anything at the time.One emotion I wasn t prepared for in my post-miscarriage journey was guilt. I blamed myself for the miscarriage. For not being able to carry what could have been my child to birth. What had I done wrong?The next time I went to visit my arthritis doctor for a scheduled checkup. she asked how I was and the story came pouring out. After listening. sympathizing. and passing me a box of tissues. my doctor told me what I wished I d known from the start. what I wish I d been taught in school. Most miscarriages occur because the fetus isn t developing as expected.  she said.Understanding that what happened truly wasn t my fault changed the way I began to understand my experience and how I defined the loss. It wasn t until at least eight weeks after my miscarriage that I cried. really cried over the loss I felt. Even if I couldn t define what I had lost. I finally allowed myself the space to grieve. Throughout the grieving process. my partner was there with me every step of the way and encouraged me to talk to him openly about the experience. My experience probably isn t as uncommon as you might think. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage — but there s a good chance this number is even higher when you take into account the people like me. who don t know they re pregnant.When miscarriages happen very early on in a pregnancy. before an expecting parent knows they re pregnant. they may be mistaken for a heavy period. I was haunted by the fact that if I hadn t ended up in the hospital after my ordeal. I may never have found out that I was pregnant. or subsequently. that I d miscarried.Reading the stories of others who have experienced miscarriages has also helped in my journey. While it is upsetting to learn about others  experiences. it is somewhat comforting to know that I m not alone. Millions of people have felt the emotions that I was left with following my experience.Like all traumas. my miscarriage is not something I see myself  getting over.  now or in the future. I haven t moved on. and sometimes the smallest of things remind me of that week in May. Sometimes I cry thinking about it. But sometimes I think of how strong I am. of how strong all of us are who have made it through this experience.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii Gov. David Ige signed an executive order Tuesday that aims to prevent other states from punishing their residents who get an abortion in the islands and stop other states from sanctioning local doctors and nurses who provide such care. We will not cooperate with any other state that tries to prosecute women who receive abortions in Hawaii. And we will not cooperate with any other state that tries to sanction medical professionals who provide abortions in Hawaii.  Ige. a Democrat. said at a news conference.U.S. Supreme Court in June overturnedIge s order takes effect immediately.Hawaii law allows abortion until a fetus would be viable outside the womb. After that. it s legal if a patient s life or health is in danger. The state legalized abortion in 1970. when it became the first in the nation to allow the procedure at a woman s request.Hawaii officials don t expect many people will travel to the islands solely to get abortions. given how far it is from the continental U.S. and how expensive it is to fly here.Even so. Dr. Reni Soon said since the Supreme Court s ruling. she has already provided abortions to residents of Texas. Georgia and Louisiana.She noted Hawaii gets a large number of tourists. The order could also protect college students and military personnel and their dependents who maintain residency in other states while they are in Hawaii temporarily.California s governor last month,Health News

Check out more stories from Busted. our series that offers an unfiltered exploration and celebration of our boobs and ourselves during breast cancer awareness month.I stood in front of the bathroom mirror and carefully removed surgical tape. absorbent pads and strips of antiseptic-soaked gauze. Scabby dark lines ran horizontally over the slightly bruised skin where my breasts had been — lines studded with stitches made from thread designed to dissolve in the body. On one side. I could see the shadows of ribs under my skin. There the surgeon had gone closer to the bone in order to remove deeply set cancerous tissue.I looked at my new flat chest not with sadness but with curiosity. Fairly buxom since my preteen years. I had often felt conflicted about my breasts. At first I was excited to show such obvious evidence that I was joining the ranks of adult women. Too often. though. they seemed to attract unwanted attention — from middle school boys popping my bra strap to strangers yelling at me on the streets or muttering in elevators. Years later. when I nursed my newborn baby for the first time. I started to appreciate my breasts — and my identity as a woman — in a completely non-sexualized way: a way to nurture new life.Perhaps surprisingly. the removal of my breasts intensified my identification with my gender. perhaps because it was treatment for a disease I shared with so many women. I began to understand that it was not my body but my experiences — of sexual harassment and assault. of childbirth and of breast cancer — that made me feel like a woman. As I looked in the mirror. I thought about the photograph I d seen when I was young: a woman proudly holding out her arms after her mastectomy. her scar the branch of a tree. I wanted to be as strong and proud as she was.My husband squeezed into our small bathroom and looked at my reflection. I love you.  he said.  You are so beautiful. Focusing on my effort to be brave rather than beautiful. I had believed my husband s love for me did not depend on how I looked. I was taken aback by the word he had chosen. and now all I could think about was how other people might see my body. How could he ever think of me as beautiful with all these uneven scars instead of feminine curves? I started to feel more fragile than I had just moments before.David turned the stiff taps in the bathtub — a twisting movement I couldn t yet make without discomfort — and waited for the water to heat up. I couldn t lift my arms above my shoulders either. so David washed my hair using the handheld shower attachment. Water streamed over my hair and tears flooded my face. Does the water hurt?  he asked. concerned.I shook my head. All I could think to say was that I felt naked. which I knew was ridiculous. Can I really do this?  I finally said.  Live flat?  Well. you don t have to decide right now.  he said after a pause.  You can always go back for reconstruction surgery if you want. Or you could just stuff socks in your bra! Although I couldn t do anything about my flatness while I was healing. I kept thinking about stuffing my bra. When I was young. my grandmother worked in a department store where she sold what she called  falsies  to post-mastectomy women. The bra inserts were stored under the counter so customers could request them without attracting attention. Most medical professionals now call the inserts  breast forms.  and women in breast cancer discussion groups often refer to them as  foobs.  or fake boobs.Before my mastectomy. I had decided I would publicly  go flat  — that is. not have reconstructive surgery or wear prostheses — because I thought it would help me accept my changed body and also because I believed it was the most honest thing to do. I wasn t ashamed that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer. and I didn t want to hide the diagnosis as so many women of my grandmother s generation had. If I was public about my own surgery. I reasoned. other women might feel less alone. Being clear about my diagnosis and showing the ways treatment had changed my body might help normalize the realities of breast cancer.Or at least that is what I felt before David s comment. Now all I could think about was how other people might stare at me or judge me. I was nervous when I contemplated my first forays outside. Would strangers who realized I d had a mastectomy always think of me as still sick and simply pity me? Would women who d decided to have reconstruction or wear breast forms think my flatness was a rejection of their own choices?I called my closest friends. Not surprisingly. they all assured me that they would support me. whatever I decided to do. A few offered to take me to the local thrift store to shop for clothes for my new flat body. If I chose instead to stuff my bra. they promised to use their crafting skills to make  fiber foobs  for me. I have since learned that homemade breast forms have an assortment of creative nicknames — from  knitted knockers  to  stash busties  (since these small projects can be a great way for a crafter to bust through a stash of yarn left over from larger projects). Maybe I would choose to wear them just occasionally. my friends suggested — with a favorite dress fitted to my former body or for job interviews when I wanted to be inconspicuous. Or perhaps I should keep people guessing. How about size B on Wednesdays. size DD on Thursdays and flat on Fridays? Their jokes left me laughing about my choice. Just knowing that I had funny friends willing to back me up no matter what I decided boosted my confidence. I acquired a few sets of outlandishly colored foobs and tucked them into a drawer formerly filled with sturdy beige underwire bras.After my surgical drains were finally removed but the stitches hadn t yet dissolved and my chest was still tender. we filled our small car to the brim with clothes. books and bedding to help our son move into his new college dorm. My breast surgeon made me promise not to carry boxes up to our son s third-floor room and to wear my bandages — and not my new foobs — all weekend.As I walked around on campus with my flat chest. people didn t seem to notice my body s shape — not even my former teacher who d undergone a mastectomy herself. Not one person stared or made comments. It didn t take long for me to decide that I was brave enough to go flat — at least most of the time. Being breastless was not nearly the public crisis — nor. I suppose. the activist statement — I thought it might be.As we drove home in our now-empty car. I began to understand that when David said I was beautiful. he wasn t talking about my body. he was acknowledging me as a full person. He assured me that I didn t need a traditionally feminine shape for him to love my body just as much as he always had. What really made me beautiful. he taught me. was that I was already as strong as a tree.Hannah Joyner is an independent historian and freelance book critic living in the Washington. D.C.. area.

New Hampshire GOP Senate nominee Don Bolduc told supporters this week that he thinks the future of abortion rights  belongs  to Republican  gentlemen  state lawmakers. who he claims know best how to give women a voice on their reproductive rights.During a Wednesday night town hall in Auburn. New Hampshire. Bolduc. a retired Army brigadier general. weighed in on whether he thinks abortion rights should be decided at the state level or the federal level. It belongs to the state. It belongs to these gentlemen right here. who are state legislators representing you.  Bolduc said. motioning to at least two Republican state representatives in the room. Jason Osborne and Jess Edwards.Edwards. for one. voted against sidelining a bill in March that would have banned abortion upon the detection of a so-called fetal  heartbeat.  a misleading reference to cardiac activity in an embryo. That means the bill would have banned abortion after about five weeks. a point at which many people don t even know that they are pregnant.Here s a shot of Bolduc s campaign event. with Edwards seated nearby (HuffPost circled him with a yellow line). Bolduc tweeted out this image after the event.Bolduc went on to say that  as a man.  he thinks that women  get the best voice  on their reproductive rights when state legislators decide how to regulate them. That is the best way. I think. as a man. that women get the best voice: at the state level. not at the federal level.  he said.Bolduc said his opponent. Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. simply doesn t understand that the best way to regulate women s access to abortion care is on a state-by-state basis. She needs to get on board with the Supreme Court decision  to end Roe v. Wade. he said.Here s an audio clip of Bolduc s remarks on abortion rights.Bolduc campaign spokesperson Kate Constantini did not respond to a request for comment on why Bolduc thinks abortion rights are best decided by Republican  gentlemen  state legislators. or why he thinks they know best how to give women  a voice  on abortion matters.Instead. Constantini accused Hassan of lying about Bolduc s record. Senator Hassan shamelessly continues to lie about General Bolduc s position. trying to scare voters and distract from her abysmal record.  she said.  The general opposes a federal ban on abortion and believes this decision should be in the hands of the states. Senator Hassan needs to end the lies and face the fact that she can no longer hide behind her deceit. Sydney Petersen. a spokesperson for Hassan s campaign. said it s clear that Bolduc thinks politicians know better than women what s good for them.  Every chance he gets. Bolduc reinforces that he believes politicians ― and more specifically Republican men ― should control a woman s most personal decision about her future.  said Petersen.  His most recent comment further underscores that if elected. he would dismiss half the population and it s clear that he would be a yes vote for a nationwide abortion ban. Hassan has been leading in the polls against Bolduc for months. She has widened her lead to nearly 8 points in the weeks since Bolduc became the official GOP nominee.A recent Axios story suggested that internally. though. her campaign manager is sounding the alarms that polling may be inaccurate and Hassan may be in more trouble than it looks.,Health News

The kind of breasts you have is determined by genetics. Having lumpy or smooth breasts is just like having large or small ones. it s out of your control and often not a cause for concern.bumpy or even rope-like Women with breasts that are lumpy-bumpy are either afraid to do any checks or note any [concerning] areas in the breast because they are worried that they re going to think everything is cancer.  said Dr. Laura Dominici. the section chief of breast surgery at Brigham and Women s Faulkner Hospital in Massachusetts.This deters them from checking for any issues at all because they re worried they aren t going to know what they re looking for. she added.According to Dr. Janet Yeh. the site chief of breast surgical oncology at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn in New York. the breast masses that people find during at-home self-checks are typically not concerning (as long as they re staying up to date with their in-office appointments. too). Most signs of breast cancer are caught by the advanced technology used in imaging. like mammograms and sonograms.But self-checks don t have any downsides. Yeh said. In fact. they re encouraged since some people do find notable concerns during a regular. at-home check.If you have lumpy boobs and are afraid to do a self-exam. you are certainly not alone. Here. experts share how people with lumpy breasts can conduct at-home exams and what to look for when they do.you should just have overall self-awareness to help monitor for any signs of breast cancer. according to both Dominici and Yeh. It s a really good thing for women to have a general sense [of] how their breast usually looks and feels.  Dominici said.This way. if something is new. different or concerning. you ll be able to make note of it and bring it to your doctor s attention. she said.shouldIf you do an at-home exam when you have a clean bill of breast health. you ll know what lumps and bumps are normal for your boobs. So. when you conduct checks in the months and years to come. you ll be able to recognize if any lumps pop up that aren t normally present. Though knowing your boobs is more important than conducting an at-home exam in one specific way. some tips can make your self-check more effective.First. lift up the arm closest to the breast that you re checking. Yeh said. Feel all around the breast. including the center area.Lastly. don t end right at the boob. you ll want to check your armpit. too. Armpits have lymph nodes that can become enlarged in people with breast cancer. In such cases. those lymph nodes feel firm. Yeh said. Normally. lymph nodes are soft.To check your armpit.  put your hand on your hip on [the] side [you re checking].  Yeh said.  You can use your other hand to fill in your armpit. If you find a mass in one breast. check the other one to see whether you feel a similar lump there. Yeh said.If you feel something of a similar size and texture in the other breast. that may just be how your tissue normally feels.Many people report that their breasts feel especially tender right before and during their period. Dominici said. So. doing your breast exam may be painful at these times.Additionally. many folks deal with swollen boobs before and during their period. which could make their breasts feel different than usual. Dominici added. This could lead to some false alarms during your check.So. it s best to wait for your period to end before you do a self-exam.Dominici recommended performing self-exams at the same time every month. and having a set routine for the check may be helpful. You could consistently do your exam in the shower. in bed or in front of a mirror. That way. you ll eventually get into a groove and know exactly how your boobs should feel in a particular position.  Lots of women have lumps in their breasts. What I recommend is feeling for anything that stands out.  Yeh said.When breast cancer is palpable. it s firm. Yeh said. She noted that a concerning lump should almost feel like a pea in mashed potatoes.Yeh added that beyond a lump. you should let your doctor know about any redness. swelling or dimpling of the skin. Discharge from your nipple when you aren t touching or squeezing it is another red flag.Your breast imaging should start at 40 and [take place] every year.  Yeh said.In some situations. that imaging is necessary at a younger age. This can be the case for people with certain gene mutations or with a significant family history. We recommend people start breast imaging 10 years before the closest relative was diagnosed. or at the age of 40 — whatever comes first.  Yeh said. So. if your mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at 44. you should consider starting your routine mammograms at 34.If you think what you re feeling may be abnormal but are not sure. don t be afraid to reach out to your doctor. It s absolutely better to be safe than sorry in this situation. Plus. experts agree that it s hard for women to know the difference between something that s OK and not OK.can be challenging for women who [have] lumpy-bumpy [breasts] because a lot of times a cyst or a fibroadenoma. which are benign findings. can feel like a firm lump.  Dominici said.In the end. if you have any doubt. you shouldn t assume that what you re feeling is normal. Your doctor is there to help you and will likely be happy that you brought a potential abnormality to their attention.,Health News
Unlike the beginning of breastfeeding. weaning your child — or ceasing to breastfeed — is often a slower. less-dramatic process. Perhaps you gradually drop one daily feed per week. holding on to the bedtime and morning feedings just a bit longer. You might not even realize it when your child nurses for the last time. But sometimes there s a compelling reason. such as medical treatment or your work schedule. to wean more quickly.Tennis superstar Serena Williams weaned her daughter Alexis Olympia after eight months in order to get her body back into prime condition for competition. Yet even the non-athletic among us can relate to the pull between career and parenting obligations. Time He doesn t understand that connection. that the best time of the day for me was when I tried to feed her.  said Williams. who eventually decided it was the right time to wean. I looked at Olympia. and I was like. ‘Listen. Mommy needs to get her body back. so Mommy s going to stop now.  We had a really good conversation. We talked it out.  Wherever your own weaning process falls on the scale of gradual to abrupt. here are a few things to keep in mind as you go. authorWhen you re nursing.  estrogen and progesterone are suppressed.  Kathleen Kendall-Tackett. a psychologist and lactation consultant. told HuffPost.  As you start the weaning. they go back up.  Kendall-Tackett continued. explaining that this shift is what often causes menstruation to begin again — although some people experience the return of their periods while they are still nursing. Oxytocin. which is sometimes known as the  love hormone  for the warm. fuzzy feeling that it can bring. is also what causes your uterus to contract in labor and accompanies milk ejection every time you nurse. The absence of  that nice little calm burst of oxytocin  as you breastfeed throughout the day  could make you feel bad.  Kendall-Tackett said. though there has been little research into the effects of weaning on a nursing parent s mental health. Inflammation is the physiology that underlies depression. and oxytocin suppresses that.  Kendall-Tackett added. drawing a possible connection between the two.  common time for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders to present or flare is around the time of weaning. especially if the weaning is less gradual.  Dr. Ann Kellams. president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine. told HuffPost. mastitise would recommend maybe spacing out the feedings gradually. or dropping one feeding over several days in order to give the body time to adjust and to avoid engorgement and discomfort.  said Kellams. If you need to wean abruptly. you may want to speak with a lactation consultant about ways to manage these risks. Other parts of your body are also affected by weaning.  Menstrual cycles can return or. if they have already returned. change quite a bit. and some parents may find that their hair. skin. mammary tissue and/or libido may be affected. as well.  said Wilson Lanoue.She noted that. in her experience. people who nurse longer generally report fewer symptoms from weaning.  Parents who choose to nurse for two or more years often report few. if any. noticeable hormonal symptoms when weaning occurs.  she said. In addition to dealing with the possible return of your menstrual cycle and the loss of those regular influxes of oxytocin. there is the emotional component of bringing your breastfeeding journey to an end.  If a parent feels comfortable with their plan and has good information and support. there may be feelings of satisfaction and enjoyment during this transition. Conversely. if a parent feels pressured to wean and if they lack that information and support. they may feel resentful. afraid or confused.  said Wilson Lanoue.Many former breastfeeding parents will say that that special breastfeeding bond. closeness. and time with the baby is the biggest thing that they miss.  added Kellams.Additionally. although we usually associate nursing during the night with getting less sleep. Kendall-Tackett says that  some people might find their sleep affected  by weaning. Changes in sleep patterns impact both your mood and your mental health overall. Whether you want to draw out the weaning process over a number of months or are working against a deadline. there are a number of things you can do to make the process easier for yourself and your child. ,Health News

Joe Biden When I go back. in the early months I probably should have tried to be much. much more careful in getting the message to repeat the uncertainty of what we re going through.  Fauci told The Washington Post s Dan Diamond in a conversation hosted by the Center for Health Journalism at USC s Annenberg School.Fauci remembered saying early in the pandemic. when there were only a handful of cases in the U.S.. that people didn t have to alter their way of life. He should have emphasized that the situation  could change rapidly and we need to be prepared.  he said. and critics later seized on his failure to assail him.Asked if health experts should tailor their public comments to anticipate that their words will be reduced to tiny sound bites  that might stick with people.  Fauci said:  You have to be very careful and think about what your words are.  It is really unfortunate. that that s the world in which we live. in that it s a bunch of sound bites. sound bites that sometimes get cut in half and get misinterpreted.  Fauci said. Someone could always make mischief by clipping out a few words.  he added.Fauci also spoke on the current state of the pandemic in the U.S.  I don t think we can say the end. being no more COVID. is in sight.

Fauci said.  No doubt about that. Fauci added that he believes the president meant that the more difficult stages of COVID have passed. He pointed out that Biden also made references to the challenges ahead.

When a child is diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. there often follows a wave of parental guilt: What caused the problem? Could it have somehow been prevented?Although doctors are not able to pinpoint the cause of an individual child s ADHD. depression or anxiety. we do know that genetics and environment both play a role in the development of such disorders.studyBy the time Superstorm Sandy made landfall in New York City in October 2012. Yoko Nomura. a professor of psychology at Queens College. and her colleagues had already embarked on the  Stress In Pregnancy Study.  funded by the National Institutes of Health. to understand the effects of maternal stress during pregnancy on children s development. When the study was underway. Superstorm Sandy happened.  Nomura told HuffPost. That gave researchers an opportunity to study how the storm affected New York children who were in utero when it hit.hundreds of thousands Because I do human research. I can t manipulate a stressor. I cannot assign a baby to a more abusive mother.  Nomura explained. The storm. she said.  provided an unparalleled opportunity to conduct a study of psychosocial stress. Nomura and her colleagues quickly added questionnaires to their study to measure the hardships faced by pregnant people during the storm. People who needed to deliver. for example. were left with only one open hospital labor and delivery ward. citywide. One pregnant woman described being trapped in an elevator for hours due to a power outage.Nomura hypothesized that the children s exposure to their mothers  stress hormones — even though the placenta converts cortisol into an inactive form. cortisone — would have an effect on children s brains. But she was surprised by the initial data that researchers collected regarding children s stress response. The difference was humongous. It was literally like over 20 times [the] difference in anxiety and aggression.  Nomura said. She and her colleagues wondered if they were  exaggerating the differences  somehow. perhaps because they were using a self-reported scale. However. in follow-up interviews where children were thoroughly assessed by trained clinicians. the numbers held. There were 163 preschool-aged children enrolled in the study. of whom 66 were exposed to Superstorm Sandy in utero and 97 were not. Eighty-five percent of the children were non-white. and 35% came from families with low socioeconomic status.The overall rate of any disorder in the Sandy-exposed group of children was significantly higher (69.2%) than in the control group (51%). Exposed children had five times the risk for anxiety disorders and ADHD. and 16 times the risk for dysthymia. also known as persistent depressive disorder.The results were even more striking when broken down by gender. Girls in the exposed group had 20 times the risk for generalized anxiety disorder. Boys had 15 times the risk for oppositional defiant disorder. 20 times the risk for conduct disorder and 62 times the risk for ADHD.  It was just so clear-cut. there was no room for arguing.  Nomura said.  [The] magnitude of difference is so strong in terms of the risks. howLittle OtterThe results of this study. Egger told HuffPost. are remarkable but not entirely surprising. (Egger is not one of the study s authors.) She believes psychiatric disorders in children this age are generally under-diagnosed. as evidenced by the high rate of such issues in both groups of children involved in the study. Egger explained that by isolating other variables. the study is able to show a link between the stress these children experienced in utero and the way their brains work. We know that genetics and environmental stressors encountered after birth have an impact on kids  mental health. but this study indicates that stressors in utero also play a role. What we really are seeing. and [what] I think this study emphasizes. is that when moms are experiencing significant stress. that it s actually getting into the architecture of the babies  brains.  Egger said.  One in five preschool children has a clinically significant mental health challenge.  she said. noting that this is the same rate as seen in older children. although kids are not generally screened for mental health issues while they are this young. Egger believes this must change. Just as we are now more aware of the benefits of early intervention for children with autism. and children are carefully screened by their providers for autism risk. Egger believes that mental health checkups should become the norm for younger children. too. People are quick to talk about kids  resilience. but we need to understand that this resilience isn t infinite. she said. There are experiences that young children have ― it s true of older people. too ― that no human being could remain intact and not be impacted.  Egger said.  I think that s where the resilience discussion needs to be nuanced. because those children didn t fail to be resilient. Kids  risk of mental health issues goes up for every stressful event. whether it s a natural disaster or a death in the family. she said.  Once a child has experienced five or more significant stressors. 100% of those children have a clinically significant problem.  Egger said.more stormsIs this different. somehow. from existential threats that humans have faced in other times? Far From The TreeOurs is not the first generation to confront a doomsday scenario. Solomon explained. citing instances of naturally occurring devastation like the bubonic plague. as well as human-created catastrophes like slavery and the Holocaust.more than twice the riskClimate change presents a unique threat. but when it comes to mental health. we have more ability than ever to screen. diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions in children. Our understanding of the complex interplay of biology and environment has advanced considerably. allowing us to identify those children who are most at risk.  These feelings of guilt are nothing new.  Parents of children with psychiatric disorders tend to blame themselves — wrongly in general.  Solomon said.  They are likewise blamed by the people around them. Part of this guilt stems from old. now disproven theories. The midcentury psychiatrists who said that schizophrenia. for instance. was caused by withholding mothers. are now viewed as naive.  Solomon said.  But these disproved theories have a long tail. and the question of blame haunts the conversation.  Likewise. Egger noted.  the field of child psychiatry is rife with blaming mothers. Of course. there s nothing the mothers in the study could have done to stop Superstorm Sandy. just as there s nothing a child can do to erase a genetic risk or an environmental stressor.What these high rates of psychiatric conditions should encourage is screening and treatment for affected families.  This is about what we don t have in place to support mothers and families and children. not about a personal failing.  Egger said. Being guilty is a waste of time.  Nomura said. It is the responsibility of policymakers. not individual parents. to provide solutions. Community health really directly is influencing individual health... so that s the kind of thing we really have to invest [in] for future generations.  she said. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the importance of thinking about health at the community level. Nomura noted. And now we can add it to the list of stressors that have affected children s mental health. whether they were in utero or in kindergarten when the pandemic hit. Rather than getting caught up in our guilt. or in trying to isolate the cause of a child s struggle. Egger suggests that parents  realize that the earlier we identify when our child is having challenges. the more effective intervention can be. Egger speaks of mental health diagnoses the way a teacher might describe a learning disability: a challenge to learn to work around and cope with. rather than a sentence to being unsuccessful or unhappy. When children are identified and treated properly. as early as possible. you re in some ways really preventing the impairment.  Egger explained.If you have concerns about your young child. you can start by discussing them with your pediatrician. who can help you find a mental health professional who can do a psychological evaluation. It can be tricky to pick up on what a preschooler is feeling when they aren t able to articulate it themselves. And signs of struggle can be difficult to interpret: Tantrums. for example. are normal for young children. However. if a child hits. bites. kicks. or breaks something during a tantrum... they are seven times more likely to have a clinically significant mental challenge.  Egger said. These  aggressive tantrums.  as Egger calls them. predict not behavior problems but depression and anxiety. parent-child interaction therapychild-parent psychotherapyWhile we may be powerless to prevent events like hurricanes.  we re not powerless in how we respond.  Egger said.  We re not powerless in the world that we create. and how we support ourselves and our kids. ,Health News
Check out more stories from Busted. our series that offers an unfiltered exploration and celebration of our boobs and ourselves during breast cancer awareness month.264.000 women in the United Statesshifted their recommendationsBut there s one area women often overlook when doing these breast checks: the underarms. Dr. Janet YehBelow. Yeh and other experts break down what happens with the underarm lymph nodes in these situations and the best way to check that area.  The underarm area is referred to as the axilla.  said Dr. Alyssa Cubbison. an assistant professor of radiology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.  Lymph nodes are normal and supposed to be there ― they re called the axillary lymph nodes. The lymph nodes play an important role in the body. which is why they can be a major part of cancer detection.  When breast cancer spreads. it tends to spread through the nearby lymph nodes.  explained Dr. Arif Kamal. chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society.  Lymph nodes are the checkpoint systems for the highway where immune cells in the body travel. When that checkpoint area gets enlarged. meaning you feel a lymph node in your underarm area. it can signify that there s something going on. Lymph nodes generally become enlarged when there s an infection. For example. the lymph nodes in your neck can swell when you have an upper respiratory infection.  Enlarged lymph nodes may feel like a larger pea or a small ball of sorts.  Kamal said.  If someone feels that in their underarm area. they should report that to their clinical team. Keep in mind that like lumps in the breast. an enlarged lymph node or lump in the underarm area isn t necessarily a sign of something very serious. but you ll need a professional to assess.  There are many benign explanations for it.  Cubbison explained.  It could just be a lymph node plumping up trying to clear an infection. but one thing we worry about is also that cancer can cause an enlarged axillary lymph node. We want to make sure we re not missing something like that. so if it feels new to you. we always advocate to get it checked out by your doctor. When it comes to inspecting the underarm area. doctors recommend the same sorts of techniques you use for your breasts. Use the pads of two fingers or your whole finger and palm area and do circular motions or wipes.  Put your hand down on your hip like you re doing a Wonder Woman pose.  Yeh advised.  That stretches out the pectoralis muscle and allows you to go in an feel the lymph nodes behind it. Feel for very firm or enlarged lymph nodes. You might feel something like a marble rolling around in there. If you notice anything new or different. let a professional know. Cubbison advised applying both superficial and deep amounts of pressure.  As you palpate or feel the area. if you press too deep. you may miss some of the superficial lymph nodes you re compressing down.  she explained.  If you press too lightly. you miss the deeper ones. So apply varying degrees of pressure. both soft and firm. Just make sure you include the whole area and use small motions. Just as the underarm isn t commonly associated with breast cancer. there are other areas Kamal suggests including in your checks as well.  What we should be paying attention to is not just the breast tissue itself. the superficial part. but also the underlying chest wall.  he said.  That would be slightly above the breast to where the clavicle or collarbone is. Also up into the lymph nodes into the neck. Pay attention to any abnormalities up into the neck and underarm as well. Remember that familiarizing yourself with your  normal  and doing regular checks is not for self-diagnosis. Don t immediately panic if you do find something different. It may well be a matter of cyclical changes in the breast related to your menstrual cycle or aging. That s for professionals to determine.  It s really a way to look for something that feels different than you d be used to and to use that as an alarm. to bring up to your clinical team. for them to follow up.  Kamal explained.  Also it s important to recognize that a self breast exam does not replace the need for regular mammography because a mammogram is going to see things with a lot more precision and accuracy than an exam done by a patient or physician. ,Health News

Black women often rank among the least healthy populations when compared to Americans in other demographics. They suffer from obesity. hypertension and pregnancy-related deaths at disproportionately higher rates than nearly any other community across the country.These differences are not due to genetics or biology. but are the result of experiencing chronic stress from inequitable systems. structural barriers and. most of all. unfair workplace environments.I know this all too well.

Realigning those policies ― and developing robust. quantifiable solutions to the discrimination Black women disproportionately endure ― starts with research-backed trainings and initiatives that center on Black voices and are informed by the historical context of racial and gender bias. Corporate leaders should ensure they have a way to measure their progress ― while bearing in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ending racism in the office. Overly general or shallow training can quickly backfire. harming the very employees they aim to help.The Fair Work InitiativeFinally. it shouldn t fall on the shoulders of Black women to solve racism. While it s important that Black women can provide their input on any new anti-racist practices in their workplace. they should not have to be involved in implementing them ― unless they choose to do so.Current diversity. equity and inclusion strategies have largely failed in their mission to produce effective results in working environments. It s time for business leaders to transform the experience of Black women in the workplace. With intersectional. evidence-based methods leading the way. they can create safe and healthy spaces for Black women to work. contribute and thrive. ,Health News
WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government is scrapping another of its responses to the pandemic.On Monday. the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its country-by-country COVID-19 travel health notices that it began issuing early in the pandemic.The reason: Fewer countries are testing for the virus or reporting the number of COVID-19 cases. That limits the CDC s ability to calculate travelers  risk. according to the agency.CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said the agency will only post a travel health notice for an individual country if a situation such as a troubling new variant of the virus changes CDC travel recommendations for that country.The CDC still recommends that travelers remain up to date on vaccines and follow recommendations found on its international travel page.That pageRestrictions such as testing and quarantine requirements greatly slowed international travel earlier in the pandemic. but many countries eventually lifted those rules for fully vaccinated and boosted people to increase tourism.United States barred peopleeventually dropped,Health News
PHOENIX (AP) — A Phoenix abortion clinic has come up with a way for patients who can end their pregnancy using a pill to get the medication quickly without running afoul of a resurrected Arizona law that bans most abortions.Under the arrangement that began Monday. patients will have an ultrasound in Arizona. get a prescription through a telehealth appointment with a California doctor and then have it mailed to a post office in a California border town for pickup. all for free.criminalizing nearly all abortions could be enforcedAshleigh Feiring. a nurse at the clinic. said the cost of the pills will be covered by the Abortion Fund of Arizona. which is helping women pay for out-of-state access to abortions. Women can use a pill for an abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. Pills and surgical abortions were legal until about 24 weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June and allowed states to ban all abortions.permanently removed rules requiring in-person consultationsNew Mexico and California to treat patientsAt Camelback Family Planning. Feiring said they are not worried about doing ultrasounds and post-abortion care for those who use the pill to have an abortion. We re not providing abortions.  Feiring said.  We re just giving people information. Those who get the pills mailed to one of three California towns along the border with Arizona would pick them up with the post office and take the first medication there before returning home and taking the second medicine. They would return to the clinic in about a week for a follow-up exam.Cathi Herrod. president of the social conservative organization Center for Arizona Policy and the architect of many of Arizona s tough abortion restrictions. slammed the proposal. The plan for abortion pills shows a stunning disregard for the health and well-being of the mother.  Herrod said.Despite the FDA approval. Herrod argues that abortion pills have significant consequences and women need an in-person exam and follow-up care. I m not surprised that the abortion industry would care more about their bottom line and about selling pills than they would about taking care of women still.  she said.Arizona is among several Republican-led states that bar delivery of abortion pills though the mail. It is one of 14 states with near-total abortion bans that the Supreme Court allowed when it overturned Roe.About 13.000 Arizona women had abortions last year. about half with a pill. Most occurred before the 15th week of pregnancy.,Health News

I imagine I m not alone when I take the time to feel around that area and wonder.  What exactly am I checking for? What would a lump actually feel like? Am I even doing this right?  So. I asked a few experts to answer those very questions. American Cancer Societyas small as a pea to larger than a golf ball In my clinical experience. a lot of times patients describe it like a pea in a pod or a frozen pea ― sort of on the smaller side. of that texture. and of that hardness.  he said.  It s generally on the smoother side for texture. generally more firm. generally not painful. And it generally does not feel like a cyst. which feels like a fluid collection ― although even if a person feels a fluid collection. they should report that to their clinical team as well. Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center You mainly want to feel around for something discrete in your breast that s separate from the rest of your breast tissue.  she explained.  Because the textures and densities of masses can be so varied. you re just feeling for anything different. as vague as that sounds. You can use your other breast as a baseline as well. Susan G. Komen See a doctor if you notice any of these breast changes.  Brown advised.  Lump. hard knot or thickening inside the breast or underarm area. swelling. warmth. redness or darkening of the breast. change in the size or shape of the breast. dimpling or puckering of the skin. itchy. scaly sore or rash on the nipple. pulling in of your nipple or other parts of the breast. nipple discharge that starts suddenly or new pain in one spot that doesn t go away. Although there are some common characteristics of lumps and other warning signs. there s ultimately no one specific thing to look or feel for when it comes to your awareness of your breasts. The key is just to understand what is normal for you so that you recognize something new or different ― and seek medical attention when you do. Part of the reason many experts no longer recommend monthly breast self-exams is that there are more organic situations during everyday life that provide the opportunity to familiarize yourself with your  normal  and keep you on alert for signs and symptoms.  Many women who discover changes in their breast or underarm area that turn out to be breast cancer don t actually discover them on the day and time they have set aside for monthly [self-exam. but rather noticed a change incidentally at some other time. such as when showering or dressing. and recognized the change because they knew what was normal for them ― or a partner noticed it.  Brown explained.Again. the idea is not to necessarily look for something specific. just to take note if there s anything new or different. Dr. Janet YehShe recommended checking your breasts when you re doing something comfortable and routine. like lying in bed. watching TV. standing in front of the mirror. or taking a shower ( it s two birds with one stone since you have to wash your body anyway ). Everyone s going to do it a little differently. and that s OK.  Yeh explained.  Some use the tips of their fingers and go in little circles. Others might say to make the shape of a star. I like to feel with my palm and fingers and do a wiping motion. I think of the breasts as a clock and wipe all around a center point ― then press in to make sure I m not missing anything behind. Lift your left arm as you check your left breast and your right arm for the right. Make sure to also check your underarms. as cancer and other issues can manifest in the form of swollen lymph nodes in that area.  Some women have very lumpy breasts. so it s important for those women to get used to their own lumps and bumps.  Yeh noted.  That way they can say. ‘OK in the upper outer area. I usually feel a lot of firmness and lumps.  And if there s something different they re unsure about. it doesn t hurt to get it checked out. even if it turns out to just be regular breast tissue. In addition to seeing a doctor when you detect any change or abnormality. make sure to schedule regular medical appointments and screenings. If you have a family history of breast cancer or personal health factors that increase your risk. talk to a doctor about that. Discuss which tests are right for you and the proper age and cadence for screenings like mammograms.  Our technology with breast imaging is so good these days that we really do pick things up early.  Yeh said.  If you re compliant with the guidelines and getting your mammogram. it ll likely pick up things before you can even feel them. Fortunately. most of the breast cancer we see is so early. we can t even feel it ourselves. Still. it remains important to let a professional know if you feel a new lump in your breast. ,Health News
Check out more stories from Busted. our series that offers an unfiltered exploration and celebration of our boobs and ourselves during breast cancer awareness month.If you or a loved one has ever pumped breast milk. you may have noticed the color of the liquid isn t always identical from one session to the next. But have you ever wondered why?Johanna SargeantShe emphasized that the milk from a morning pumping session can look different from what s expressed during an evening session. and milk from two days postpartum will likely differ from what you see two months or even two years later.  Most of the color differences in these situations are due to changes in fat and water content of the milk. though there are a whole rainbow of other colors that can pop up too. depending on your diet and your own biology.  Sargeant added.Indeed. the color of breast milk tends to change based on what foods or medications the parent is consuming. However. that generally doesn t mean its quality has changed ― so don t immediately throw out milk that differs from previous pumping sessions. Leigh Anne O Connor  The very first milk that your baby gets is also called colostrum ― though it is. indeed. a type of milk.  Sargeant explained.  This condensed breast milk is often bright yellow or orange in color. which comes from high levels of beta-carotene. which is essential for cellular health and is a precursor to vitamin A. As you progress beyond those early postpartum days. your mature milk can appear yellowish at times as well. La Leche League AllianceA slight yellow shade might also be an indication that the fat content of the breast milk is higher. During a pumping or feeding session. the first milk that comes out is known as the foremilk. and the milk that follows is called the hindmilk. While the foremilk is generally higher in lactose. hindmilk is fattier and thus more likely to look yellowish. As noted previously. the parent s diet can have an impact on the color as well.  We know that eating foods high in beta-carotine. such as carrots or sweet potatoes. can also give your milk a more yellow hue.  Sargeant said. Wendy WisnerIndeed. the artificial coloring in sports drinks and other beverages can give your milk a variety of tints. including green. The same goes for consuming seaweed. spirulina or certain multivitamins. Medications like nifedipine. which is used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain. may also have this emerald effect on breast milk.  Breastfeeding and Human Lactation. As with the green hue. breast milk may appear more blueish if a parent drinks a blue energy drink or other artificially blue beverage. However. there are other more common reasons.  Milk that is very clear and may have a slight blue tinge is usually milk that has a higher proportion of water. protein and sugars. with a lower fat percentage.  Sargeant explained.  The blue tint is thought to come from the casein. the protein found in the milk. She noted that blueish milk often comes from very full breasts producing an overall larger volume of milk. So if you haven t nursed recently. your breast milk will likely take on that clearer. almost blue color when you first express (and eventually look thicker and more yellowish). Here. some of the fat globules stick to the sides of the milk ducts. and are only released later on in the feed.  Sargeant said. highlighting the difference between the foremilk and the higher fat-content hindmilk. Keep in mind that this more clear milk is filled with everything essential for baby s growth. including enough fat. along with stem cells. antibodies and many other amazing things.  she emphasized.  So this kind of milk is in no way ‘worse  than the creamier. fattier. whiter milk that you may see coming from emptier breasts. or from later on in a pump. there s no published researchhave speculatedSome medications. like rifamycin antibiotics and the leprosy treatment clofazimine. have been reported to give breast milk a pink or red tint. Food dyes and certain foods may have the same effect. especially when eaten in large quantities.  Beets can turn it reddish or pinkish.  Wisner said.  Other reasons for reddish milk can be from blood ― cuts on the nipple that have mixed with milk. Before you panic upon seeing blood in your milk. understand that it could be the result of minor external or internal injuries to the nipple or milk ducts. Although it may be alarming to look at. your breast milk remains safe for your baby.  An open wound in the nipple may release some blood into the milk and create pink milk. or a burst capillary inside the breast can result in a deeper red color of milk.  Sargeant said.  While it s clear that it is fine to feed your baby milk that has some blood in it. beware that it may make your baby s poop darker. and can be harder on their digestion. If you are worried and are planning to discard your milk. you can leave your milk in the fridge for a few hours and the blood cells will often settle towards the bottom of the bottle. In most cases. reddish or pinkish breast milk is not an issue. but there are a couple of situations to pay attention to. blood in the milk can be a sign of breast cancerShe and Sargeant also urged parents to look out for a persistent pink color. which may indicate a bacterial infection.  There is really only one color where you need to be a little more aware. and that is if your milk has become fluorescent pink.  Sargeant said.  I m talking  80s style bike-shorts pink. In this situation. it could be a sign of the presence of a particular bacteria. serratia marsescens. which is worth ruling out with your doctor. Brown or black may feel like even more troubling colors to see in your breast milk. but rest assured. there are normal explanations for these hues. Rusty pipe syndromeAs always. just monitor the situation to see if the appearance changes over time. as it likely will once the residual ductal blood is gone. Talk to a health care professional if the brown color persists. however. When it comes to black breast milk. medicine is the likely culprit.  The antibiotic Minocin has been known to change breast milk to black.  O Connor noted.If you re prescribed a minocycline antibiotic or really any medication. ask your doctor if it s safe to take while nursing. ,Health News
STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish scientist Svante Paabo won this year s Nobel Prize in medicine Monday for his discoveries on human evolution that provided key insights into our immune system and what makes us unique compared with our extinct cousins. the award s panel said.Paabo has spearheaded the development of new techniques that allowed researchers to compare the genome of modern humans and that of other hominins — the Neanderthals and Denisovans.While Neanderthal bones were first discovered in the mid-19th century. only by unlocking their DNA — often referred to as the code of life — have scientists been able to fully understand the links between species.This included the time when modern humans and Neanderthals diverged as a species. determined to be around 800.000 years ago. said Anna Wedell. chair of the Nobel Committee. Paabo and his team also surprisingly found that gene flow had occurred from Neanderthals to Homo sapiens. demonstrating that they had children together during periods of co-existence.  she said.transfer of genes between hominin speciesPaabo. 67. performed his prizewinning studies in Germany at the University of Munich and at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A much-debated drug for Lou Gehrig s disease won U.S. approval Thursday. a long-sought victory for patients that is likely to renew questions about the scientific rigor behind government reviews of experimental medicines.The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug from Amylyx Pharmaceuticals based on results from one small. mid-stage study in which patients with the debilitating disease appeared to progress more slowly and survive several months longer. Typically. the FDA requires two large studies or one study with  very persuasive  survival results for approval. This approval provides another important treatment option for ALS. a life-threatening disease that currently has no cure.  FDA s neurology drug director Dr. Billy Dunn said in a statement.The drug. Relyvrio. is the third U.S.-approved medicine for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. or ALS. which destroys nerve cells needed for basic functions like walking. talking and swallowing. About 20.000 people in the U.S. are living with the disease.The FDA s review has become a flashpoint in broader debates about the regulatory agency. including how flexible it should be when reviewing drugs for deadly diseases and how much weight it should give to appeals from patients and other outside voices. I think it demonstrates the FDA s ability to be facile and I think it demonstrates a lot of tenacity on the part of ALS patients and advocates.  said Dr. Catherine Lomen-Hoerth. an ALS specialist at the University of California San Francisco.  The company really tried to do everything possible to get this potentially promising drug out to patients. stringneurological drugsAduhelmIn an online memo summarizing its decision. the FDA said  regulatory flexibility  was appropriate for approving Relyvrio.  given the serious and life-threatening nature of ALS and the substantial unmet need. negative reviewsnarrowly votingintense pressurebacked the drugSeveral panelists said they were also reassured by an extraordinary exchange at the meeting in which FDA s Dr. Dunn requested — and Amylyx affirmed — that the company would voluntarily pull its drug from the market if a large. ongoing study doesn t confirm its benefit.That 600-patient study is expected to report results in 2024.But experts have pointed to the many potential problems with such an informal commitment. The FDA and the company could disagree on whether the final data supports the drug. or a company that acquires the drug in the future may not feel bound by Amylyx s pledge.The powder-based drug is a combination of two older ingredients: a prescription medication for liver disorders and a dietary supplement associated with traditional Chinese medicine. Cambridge. Massachusetts-based Amylyx has patented the combination and says the chemicals work together to shield cells from premature death.Some ALS patients already take both drugs separately. sometimes paying $5.000 a month for the prescription component. according to physicians. FDA approval is expected to compel insurers to cover Amylyx s medication.Amylyx did not immediately disclose the price Thursday but said it planned to announce the information on a call with investors Friday morning. In Canada. where the drug received approval in June. the company has proposed a price equating to $165.000.One outside group that analyzes the cost effectiveness of new treatments pegged the drug s value at between between $9.100 and $30.700 per year. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review also noted that many patients are expected to take Amylyx s drug in combination with an older therapy. which costs over $170.000 per year.Sunny Brous was diagnosed with ALS in 2015 and hopes to add Relyvrio to the two older FDA-approved medications she already takes for the disease. I ve made it this far without this drug and I m hoping having it now will extend my life further.  said Brous. who is 35 and lives near Fort Worth. Texas.Amylyx s data came from a 6-month study in 137 patients that showed some benefit in slowing the disease. based on functionality questionnaires completed by patients. Patients who continued taking Relyvrio after the study concluded appeared to survive longer than patients who originally received a placebo. the FDA noted. The ALS community has proven that our advocacy can impact decisions that are being made about our health.  said Larry Falivena. an ALS Association board member who was diagnosed with the disease in 2017. in an emailed statement. The group invested $2.2 million in Amylyx s early research and stands to recoup $3.3 million from drug sales.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

California Gov. Gavina billThe new law. which will go into effect on Jan. 1 next year. takes direct aim at Alabama and Texas for those two states  efforts to criminalize parents who allow their transgender children to receive hormone therapy and other types of gender-affirming treatments.  In California we believe in equality and acceptance. We believe that no one should be prosecuted or persecuted for getting the care they need ― including gender-affirming care.  Newsom said in a statement. The new law will prohibit California law enforcement from cooperating with any out-of-state individuals or agencies regarding any legal gender-affirming care performed in California. as well as ban any compliance with an out-of-state subpoena related to such matters. The hate demonstrated by these laws is unfathomable and has contributed to soaring suicide rates.  Newsom said.  82% of transgender individuals have considered killing themselves. and 40% have attempted suicide. with suicidality highest among transgender youth.  2020 studyverywelldocumentedThe bill s author. state Sen.

much less likely to be infectedThe data — compiled from 32 states from July to September — is the first analysis released by public health officials into the vaccine s effectiveness when monkeypox was largely spreading across LGBTQ+ communities this summer.Those who didn t receive a single dose of the vaccine were 14 times more likely to be infected than those who had. officials said. They stressed that immune protection was best at two weeks after the second dose of a monkeypox vaccine. Current guidelines suggest those at risk receive two shots 28 days apart to provide  durable. lasting immune protection.   These early findings and similar results from studies in other countries suggest that even one dose of the monkeypox vaccine offers at least some initial protection against infection.  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing Wednesday.  That said. we know from laboratory studies that immune protection is highest two weeks after the second dose of vaccine.  These new data provide us with a level of cautious optimism that the vaccine is working as intended.  she added.Black and Hispanic men have received a disproportionately lowCases have declined in recent weeks. but Walensky said the recent data was encouraging and the CDC would expand eligibility to include preventative vaccination for vulnerable communities. more than 25.000 cases By expanding eligibility and shifting to a PrEP strategy across the country. we are looking to ensure those who are at the highest risk for monkeypox receive the vaccine before exposure and that vaccines continue to be made available equitably to those who need them.  she said.The findings released this week still have some gaps: The data doesn t include details about the severity of cases in vaccinated people who contracted monkeypox or how long the vaccine may provide protection. There is also no data showing how behavioral changes may have prevented infection.  We re going to need a little bit more time and a bit more numbers.  Walensky said Wednesday.  This is really in an effort to give you all the data as soon as we have it. ,Health News

Your skin is an open book to a professional. If you re sleeping in your makeup. popping pimples or not drinking enough water. it s likely they ll be able to tell by the state of your skin. What are the habits they wish you d change? They told us all about it. Every day I see patients who have attempted to replicate a skin routine they found through social media.  said Dr. Hysem Eldik.Marmur Medical. It s tricky to think that one influencer s routine can work for someone else. Skin is unique. and no two patients are alike.  Tara Adashev offered a similar warning:  It seems that if it s on TikTok. and it s a skin care trend. it s a ‘must try.  Some of these trends are horrible for your skin or aren t individually based. Naana Boakyean entire story about itDermatologist Courtney Rubin knows that some of her patients tend to think: If a little is good. a lot will be better. But this isn t a smart way to treat your skin. Rubin explained:  Many of my patients over-exfoliate their skin. either with manually abrasive scrubs or brushes. or with chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid. Many people incorrectly think that their breakouts and skin issues are due to the skin being ‘dirty.  but over-exfoliation often makes things worse because it damages the skin barrier. What s the ideal pace for exfoliation?  Once or twice a week can help to remove dead skin cells from the surface of the skin.  Rubin said.  But doing it five to seven times a week can break down the skin barrier. leading to inflammation and redness. burning/stinging. flaking. dryness and breakouts. Similarly. dermatologist Claire Wolinsky.clinical instructor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. said she sees many patients overusing products.  Patients often come in with complex skin care regimens. and after reviewing. I find they are using multiple vitamin C products. or a few AHA/BHAs or layering both a retinol and retinoid in the same day.  she said.  Overdoing one ingredient can not only be a waste of money. but it increases the risk of skin irritation. While some patients are overdoing it with cleansing. others are ignoring the most germ-ridden parts of their life.Dermatologist Marisa Garshick warned about the dangers of not cleaning your phone or changing your pillowcase.  They can accumulate oil. bacteria and residue from skin and hair products. which can all contribute to breakouts or irritation on the skin.  she said.  When patients come in with a rash or breakouts only on one side of the face. it often turns out that s the side they use to speak on their phone. or that they sleep on. That buildup can have an impact on the skin. Another place for greater cleaning vigilance is your makeup brushes. said dermatologist Corey Hartman.  The face is a prime spot for bacteria. and makeup brushes pick up this bacteria on the face during application.  he said.  That bacteria can be left in the brush for weeks. if not months. Every time you put a dirty makeup brush on your skin. you risk adding bacteria to the face that can lead to acne or an infection. You might love long. luxurious baths and showers. but your dermatologist knows they re not necessarily good for your skin. Dermatologist Michael Gold flags this as a concern for his patients with atopic dermatitis. Water can cause the skin to be excessively dry.  he said.  I recommend getting in and out of the shower or bath. patting dry and then applying a dermatologist-recommended moisturizer. Using products past their sell-by date is a no-no. said dermatologist DiAnne Davis. The products are no longer effective. and depending on the active ingredient. they could potentially cause irritation to the skin past its shelf life.  she said.  If products don t have an expiration date. I recommend changing them each season.  Side sleeping is harmful to skin. since it aggravates chest wrinkles and increases sagging on your face and décolleté.  said dermatologist Luigi Polla. founder of Forever Institut and Alchimie Forever.  I can tell how a patient sleeps by looking at their facial wrinkles. because they re deeper on the side that s slept on. Dermatologist Hadley King said it s surprising when patients think that tanning is fine as long as they re wearing sunscreen. There s no such thing as a healthy tan.  she said.  It s a defense mechanism that kicks in when the DNA of your skin cells is getting damaged by UV radiation. which leads to increased risk of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.  I ve had patients come in with spots and scars on their skin after trying at-home remedies to remove moles and other growths.  said dermatologist Brian Hibler.  These treatments typically cause a chemical burn to the skin to remove the growth. and they can result in scarring and infection. In addition. if it were to be a skin cancer. the patient may not have removed all of the cancerous cells. and the cancer can recur or continue to grow under the skin. with risk of spreading.  One of the most harmful habits I hear about from my patients is skipping sunscreen when it s cloudy.  said dermatologist Reid Maclellan. founder and CEO of Cortina and an adjunct faculty member at Harvard Medical School.  Sunscreen should be applied every day. rain or shine. because exposing your skin to UV rays can lead to sun damage and skin cancer. DermatologistRebecca Marcus. founder of Maei MD. noted another type of sun-protection complacency.  Combination makeup/sunscreen products usually don t have enough sunscreen.  she said.  In order to get the full SPF effect that s listed on the label. you d have to use a much larger amount of product than is typically used for makeup. So it s best to keep your makeup and sunscreen separate. or to use a tinted sunscreen instead. ,Health News

A version of the same sleep-regulating hormone produced by your own body. easily and inexpensively available over the counter. that might help you — or your child — fall asleep: If you re thinking.  Sounds worth a try.  your thoughts are in alignment with the millions of people who have been purchasing melatonin in recent years. Unlike sleeping pills. which require a prescription. can be habit-forming and aren t recommended for children. melatonin appears to offer a safer alternative. $285 million in U.S. salesU.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMost of these overdoses were unintentional and occurred at home in children younger than 5. Though most of the children didn t have symptoms. 14.7% were hospitalized. 1% required intensive care and two children died. The CDC analysis notes that the biggest uptick in accidental ingestions occurred from 2019 to 2020. coinciding with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. This might be related to children spending more time at home or to more adults purchasing melatonin to treat sleep problems — both for themselves and their kids. It s now the most common supplement. after multivitamins. that parents give their children. according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Mayo ClinicevidenceYet melatonin is not exactly the safe. sure-fire sleep solution that its surging popularity suggests. advisoryWhat is melatonin. and how does it work?Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in your brain in response to a decrease in light. such as nightfall. Your brain starts to release melatonin two hours before you fall asleep and signals your body and other brain sleep chemicals to get ready to sleep.  Dr. Carol Rosen. a pediatrician and member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. told HuffPost. Dr. Janine Zee-ChengWhat could be dangerous about a hormone your body produces?Though melatonin is not as dangerous as other medications you might have in your house. accidental ingestion can cause symptoms such as headache. stomach upset and sleepiness. Doctors don t know the exact danger dose.  Rosen said. The number of children who had to be hospitalized after ingesting melatonin was small. but you can eliminate this risk by storing all medications and supplements safely so that children cannot access them. When can melatonin be helpful for kids?There are safe levels that can be helpful for children in certain circumstances. but. as the advisory notes. you should discuss all of this with your doctor before giving a child melatonin.  For children with primary sleep-onset insomnia. melatonin can be helpful. It can also be beneficial for children on the spectrum of neurodiversity. or with neurodevelopment differences. who may have difficulty initiating sleep.  Zee-Cheng said. She added that she takes a detailed sleep history before considering melatonin for a patient. Pediatric doses generally range from 0.5 milligram to 6 mg. said Rosen.  Doctors will recommend doses that best fit the child s needs and size. It also appears that more isn t necessarily better. Zee-Cheng pointed to research indicating that very small doses of melatonin can work well. One-milligram doses have been shown to be as effective as larger doses.  she said. What should parents know before giving kids supplements? First. parents should understand that something classified as a dietary supplement. which is the case for melatonin in the U.S.. is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration the way a prescription or over-the-counter medicine is. In Canada. over-the-counter melatonin supplements are banned. It s up to companies to represent their own products truthfully. and research shows that. when it comes to melatonin. the manufacturers shouldn t necessarily be trusted. study This is important because serotonin syndrome is a well-described and extremely serious condition.  Zee-Cheng said. Don t make assumptions based on a product being labeled  all-natural.  she added.  ‘All natural  doesn t mean benign. In addition. melatonin supplements are frequently sold as sweet gummies or chewable tablets that. to a child. are indistinguishable from candy. increasing the odds of accidental ingestion in potentially large quantities. How else can parents encourage children to get a good night s sleep?If you re struggling with sleep in your household. you re not alone. It can be tricky to find a sleep routine that works for your family. particularly when children s sleep needs change as they grow and develop. Zee-Cheng suggests knowing how many hours of sleep your child needs at their age. maintaining a consistent bedtime and decreasing light levels in the bedroom.suppresses Melatonin is just one of many tools to optimize sleep. and it is only appropriate in certain people.  Zee-Cheng said. If you re considering giving your child melatonin or any other dietary supplement. talk to your doctor first.  My wife and I are parents to a first-grader and a preschooler. and they both have different sleep needs. and we have very different sleep expectations for each of them.  Zee-Cheng said.She added that pediatricians understand that getting kids to sleep can be hard. and they are there to help you problem-solve. not to pass judgment. We just want to be able to equip families with all the tools they need for successful sleep for everyone. ,Health News

BOISE. Idaho (AP) — Idaho universities are warning staffers not to refer students to abortion providers. and at least one public university is barring employees from telling students how to obtain emergency contraception or birth control as well. It s the latest restriction in a state that already holds some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. This is going to have a very broad impact.  said Mike Satz. an attorney and former faculty member and interim dean at the University of Idaho s College of Law.  It s going to have a very strong chilling effect on free speech and it s going to scare people. I m afraid it s going to scare people from going to school here or sending their kids to school at Idaho institutions. The prohibition against referring students to abortion providers or  promoting  abortion in any way comes from the  No Public Funds for Abortion Act.  a law passed by Idaho s Republican-led Legislature in 2021. Boise State University. like the University of Idaho. told faculty members in a newsletter earlier this month that they could face felony charges for violating the law. Idaho State University did not respond to phone messages from The Associated Press asking if it had issued similar guidance.The law also bars staffers and school-based health clinics from dispensing or telling students where to obtain emergency contraception. such as the Plan B pill. except for in cases of rape. Emergency contraception drugs prevent pregnancy from occurring and do not work in cases where someone is already pregnant.The University of Idaho s guidance released Friday goes a step further. also warning employees about a law written in 1867. 23 years before Idaho became a state. That law prohibits dispensing or  advertising  abortion services and birth control — leading to UI s advice that condoms be distributed only to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. but not to prevent pregnancy.It s not yet clear how the the law barring  advertising or promoting  abortion and birth control services could impact students or other state employees who may use state-owned computers or wireless networks to share information about how to access reproductive health care on Instagram or other social media sites. Scott Graf. a spokesman for Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden. said his office planned to discuss the guidance given to university staffers and the abortion laws in an internal call Tuesday morning.Jodi Walker. spokeswoman for the University of Idaho. said the university follows all laws and said UI officials were still  working through some of the details.  This is a challenging law for many and has real ramifications for individuals in that it calls for individual criminal prosecution.  she said of the public funds law.  The section does not specify what is meant by promoting abortion. however. it is clear that university employees are paid with public funds. Employees engaging in their course of work in a manner that favors abortion could be deemed as promoting abortion. Abortion can still be discussed as a policy issue in classrooms.

 You ve got two minutes to make your decision. The delivery doctor looks up from between my legs. I gaze at the ceiling and focus on a fluorescent light. trying to push my fear into its glow.  What are the risks?  I ask. If you have an emergency c-section at this stage. the primary risk is permanent damage to your uterus and risk of hemorrhage.  the doctor replies.  If I deliver with forceps. there s a chance your baby may have a small amount of facial bruising. If you go with forceps. it ll be over in a matter of minutes.  I choose forceps. Twelve people suddenly appear in the room: doctors. nurses. paramedics. students. They line up solemnly against the back wall. Someone wheels a tray of gleaming metal instruments to the bottom of the bed.  Right.  I hear.  One big push.  Then there she is. My daughter. Pale and silent. Then red and screaming. I hold her as I shake convulsively. in a stupor after 50 hours of labor.Two doctors spend an hour sewing me up. I don t understand what is happening to my body. only that my baby and I have made it to the other side. Alive. At that moment. that is enough.  You have a severe third-degree tear and a shattered tailbone.  my obstetrician tells me later that day.  Keep icing it. Use Dermaplast. See me in two weeks. You may experience fecal incontinence. so I m going to refer you to a pelvic floor therapist.  He glances at my exposed stomach. riddled with a furious network of stretch marks.  Oh dear.  he grimaces.  Your poor belly.  about 90%When the epidural wore off. the pain was indescribable. Back at home. I waddled around with my newborn strapped to my chest. legs as far apart as they would go. giant ice packs falling out of the flimsy mesh underwear provided by the hospital. Simply sitting in a chair sent pain shooting through my body. Getting out of it took an agonizing ten minutes. I didn t dare look at my Frankenvulva in the mirror.When I went back for my obstetrician appointment two weeks later. it turned out that one of the stitches wasn t sewn correctly and there was a piece of skin hanging where it shouldn t. It had to be burned off. A shadowy sense of shame began to surround me. Despite the traumatic nature of the delivery. I felt okay talking about my birth and my broken tailbone. But the fact that my vagina had ripped almost to my ass? I didn t really discuss it with anyone ― including my husband.I felt as though I d been neutered. Unsure of how I could ever even entertain the idea of having sex again. Convinced that the pain would last forever (ultimately. it took over two years for me not to be aware of it). Every time I peed. I had a water bottle on hand to help dilute the searing sting. Like so many other women. I just dealt with it in silence. My pelvic floor therapy sessions petered out as I went back to work a couple of months later. I could barely make time in my schedule to pump. let alone take a cab into downtown Chicago for twice-weekly appointments. Well. this is motherhood. I thought. The moment a child is born. the mother stops being the patient. We re expected to smile. Be grateful for our baby. Be quiet. Just deal with it. Many women don t realize that childbirth can involve such extreme injury. Fortunately. that s starting to change. In 2018 ― a year after I gave birth to my daughter ― Keira Knightly wrote a personal essay about her first childbirth experience.  My vagina split.  she wrote.  You came out with youreyes open. Arms up in the air. Screaming.  She wrote that women are then expected to hide:  Hide our pain. our bodies splitting. our breasts leaking. our hormones raging.  In 2020. Chrissy Teigen tweeted in response to people complaining about taking PCR tests.  My vagina was ripped to my asshole giving birth to Luna.I had a vagasshole. Fuck your swab pain.  The rise of celebrities talking about their own birth injuries helped catalyze a tide change in thetypes of conversations I heard around me. Other mothers began to talk more openly about thebrutality of birth. I joined in. galvanized by the knowledge that I was not alone. Instagrambecame a hub of support and community. with pages such as Life After Fourth Degree Tearsdedicated to sharing people s stories. fourth trimestersYes. tearing is almost certainly going to happen if you have a vaginal delivery. Most people willhave a first- or second-degree tear. The more severe injuries ― which are far more challenging torecover from ― are uncommon (about 6 in 100 births) and scary to contemplate. But not talkingabout it means that many people have trouble getting adequate information priorto delivery and feel unprepared and unsupported during recovery. Now knowing firsthand therisks and severe consequences of tearing in childbirth. here s some advice I d share with othermothers-to-be: Educate yourself on the risk factors of severe tears andincorporate prevention and aftercare strategies into your birth and postpartum careplans. You cannot actually prevent a significant tear ― it s largely due to forces outside ofyour control. such as the size of your baby and your anatomy. But seeing a pelvic floortherapist in the months before giving birth may help reduce recovery time after delivery.no matter how severe the tear. Perineal massage and stretching prior to delivery mayalso help with muscle pliability and help mitigate the impact of the tear. During delivery. you can ask your doctor. doula or midwife tosupport your perineum with their hand as you push. which has been proven to help reducethe severity of tearing. Press for a proper diagnosis and review of your injury (many moms Iknow were told they had a tear. but had no idea to what degree). If you suspectsomething is wrong. don t brush it away: You know your body best. Talk to your doctor.If you suffer from a major tear. request regular check-ups with your medical provideruntil you are fully healed. If you are working and still in discomfort. speak to HR and seeif there are ways for your company to help support you as you heal. And if you think youmay have PTSD from your delivery experience. reach out to a mental healthprofessional. There are some incredibly effective techniques to help resolve feelings ofanger. grief and shame that can arise from a difficult birth. Every OB-GYN. doulaand midwife I ve ever spoken to says the same thing: They wish pelvic floor therapywas mandatory and accessible for every single person who gives birth. Book somesessions for a couple of weeks after your due date in advance. You ll be glad you did. Ice therapy is proven to help ease discomfort andspeed up recovery time. Sitz baths are a blessing. Stool softeners are your best friend.Use a peri bottle when you pee to help dilute the sting of urine. Donut cushions arereally helpful. too. as they prevent your vulva/perineum from coming into direct contactwith your chair. Researchindicates that women s pain levels afterexperiencing a second-degree tear or greater can be linked to their risk for developingpostpartum depression. Combined with the intimate nature of the topic and how somany of us don t feel comfortable talking about our vulvas in general. it s little wonder that so many women feel isolated and alone in their pain. But you are not. The statisticsalone prove it. You do not need to suffer silently. as so many of us have beenconditioned. By talking. sharing and ensuring we have the means to take care ofourselves ― and each other ― mothers and birthing people can find a connective.collective resilience and invaluable support system to help us as we move through thepain. onwards to the other side.

 lookhile this spans across cultures. when it comes to the Hispanic community.  there is a negative perception about mental health care in general.  said Dr. Ruby Castilla-Puentes. the president of the American Society of Hispanic Psychiatry. Because of this.  there are misunderstandings about mental health. This can make it hard for people in the Latine community to realize they need help. talk to loved ones about mental health and ultimately seek treatment. But. there are many experts who focus on creating safe spaces where people can explore their identity. their emotions. their problems and more. Here. experts share how to find a therapist who focuses on Latine mental health. Hispanic folks are looking for mental health providers that are culturally competent.  Castilla-Puentes said. adding that this can mean a therapist who speaks Spanish or someone with a deep knowledge of Hispanic-Latino culture.Castilla-Puentes noted that miscommunication. either because of language barriers or cultural misunderstandings. causes many people in the Latine community to feel misunderstood by people in the mental health field. This can cause a  lack of confidence in the ability to receive the service that they need.  she added.That being said. Brandie Carlos. the founder of Therapy for Latinx. noted that as a community. there is a large spectrum of cultures and beliefs.  We re not a monolith.  she said. Make a list of the things you want your therapist to understand about you. your family or your culture. or make a list of the languages you want them to speak. Carlos noted that some people don t want to go through the trouble of translating certain phrases from Spanish to English in therapy. while other people purely want someone who will speak English. It s a totally personal preference. Additionally. you should decide what goals you want to achieve in therapy and what subject areas you want to focus on. From there. ask questions when you meet with therapists to see if they are a fit for you. a lot like dating.  Carlos said. And like dating. it s perfectly OK to go on a few introductory therapy meetings before finding a therapist you click with. There is nothing wrong with looking around for a therapist. and all mental health professionals have come to expect this — not everyone can be a match for every patient. Because of the stigma associated with mental health. it can be hard to admit that you need support. This is challenging across many cultures. but can have particular difficulties in the Latine community where people are afraid of being labeled as  loco.  according to Castilla-Puentes. they believe that depression is not a disease. it s a part of life they need to pass through without any treatment.  unmotivated. sad or tiredIf you re feeling off. know you don t have to go through a hard time without any support. Depression is not something you need to  get through  on your own. The American healthcare field can be a challenge for people who are undocumented. who often worry about being detained or separated from their families. This also rings true in the mental health field. Carlos noted. She added that it s not unheard of for these individuals or their loved ones to avoid care because of these fears. Fears like  what could happen if the mental health provider reports an incident to the police?  come front of mind.Latinx Therapists Action NetworkAdditionally. ask how your therapist handles emergency situations. she said. Find out if they call the police when someone is having suicidal ideation or if they ll call friends and family first. Also. find out if they are under any requirements to report those who are undocumented to government agencies. section of its websitebroken up by stateTherapy for LatinxLatinx TherapyInclusive TherapistsOpen Path CollectiveEven if you are not a Spanish speaker or don t want to speak Spanish in your therapy appointments. Carlos recommended that you use the language filter on online databases to find someone who speaks Spanish (just make sure they also speak English if you are not fluent in the language).This way.  you might find someone who shares the same culture even if you don t speak Spanish.  she said.,Health News
COVID-19 booster shotDr. Onyema Ogbuagu. an infectious diseases specialist and associate professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. noted that the new booster shot is here in anticipation of a fall surge in COVID cases. So. when should you get your booster? As soon as possible. in order to help fend off a fall wave and keep yourself healthy. But while those who have not had a recent COVID infection can get their shot now. the timeline guidance differs for those who recently had a COVID infection.Here s what to know if you just had the virus:Food and Drug Administration authorized the bivalent boosterDr. Andy PekoszSo. if you re looking for a hard and fast rule. it s safe to say you should wait two months after infection (or vaccination) to get your new shot.Some experts. however. think you can actually wait longer.  There are some immunologists that think spacing that booster out longer might help generate longtime immunity.  Pekosz said. An infection should give you pretty good protection for four to six months. which means you probably don t need to take the booster shot before then. he said.But although immunity can last for four to six months in many people. that is not always the case. Ogbuagu said.a Danish studycan circumvent natural immunity more quickly Anyone who recovered from COVID certainly can consider delaying vaccination. but I don t think they need to wait as far out as three months.  Ogbuagu said.canIn the end. Pekosz said. it s better to get the booster than not get the booster.  even if it s not an optimal time. Ogbuagu stressed that certain groups of people who are at high risk for COVID should not wait too long to get their booster shot. This goes for elderly people or people who are immunocompromised.He noted that people who fall into these groups should not get the shot before the two-month mark. but they probably also shouldn t wait much longer than two months to ensure they re protected against the dominant strain.According to Pekosz. the reason behind the differing opinions about the timeline of the new shot is that booster shots traditionally work best when some time has elapsed since the previous infection or vaccination. If an infection and the booster are too close to each other.  your immune system is [still] ramping up and you don t get the real benefits of the booster.  he said. When you give your body ample time to drum up its immune response to an infection and then slow down. the booster can jump-start that immune response again. he noted.While the exact timeline is still being debated. there are no safety concerns whether you decide to get your booster after two months or six months. Pekosz said. Vaccines are the best and safest way to strengthen your immunity.  Pekosz said. He noted that earlier variants of the virus provided better protection against reinfection. but this is not the case for omicron.Plus. the latest bivalent COVID booster is a better booster. one that can keep you from developing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. The new booster  improves your responses to the original vaccine and gives you protection from BA.5 that is currently the dominant variant in the United States and most of the world.  Pekosz said.So. even if you had COVID recently. you should still get this new shot. That being said. if you were infected and are unvaccinated. you have to start the vaccination series from the beginning. Pekosz said. You can t just jump ahead to this bivalent vaccine.Whatever you do. getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself.Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

Though SARS-CoV-2 was originally thought to be a respiratory virus. it s become increasingly clear that the virus can have serious consequences on brain health. Many people have experienced neurologicalsymptoms — like loss of taste and smell. headache and memory and attention issues— while infected. and most people who develop longCOVID experience brain fog and cognitive problems like reduced concentration. Now. new research suggests that COVID may increase our risk of developing brain disorders like Alzheimer s disease. too. The study. which was published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease. found that older adults who were infected with COVID had a 50 to 80% higher chance of developing Alzheimer s compared to people who d never had COVID. Doctors don t think that COVID directly causes Alzheimer s as much as it unmasks underlying illness or speeds up disease that s already simmering. Scientists are still learning about the ways in which COVID can impact our ability to learn. remember. focus and perceive. but research suggests that infections. in general. can have a serious impact on our cognitive function. not only in the short term but in the long term as well.  These findings are not surprising to me since there is increasing understanding that medical stressors. from surgery to urinary tract infections. can lead to abrupt declines in cognitive abilities called ‘delirium  or ‘encephalopathy.  which is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for subsequent dementia diagnosis.  Dr. Joshua Cahan. an assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. told HuffPost.The researchers evaluated the health records of 6.2 million adults age 65 and older who had received medical treatment between February 2020 and May 2020. At the start of the study. no one had previously been diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease. The individuals were split into two groups: people who had COVID (over 400.000) and people who had not (about 5.8 million). The research team found that that the risk of getting Alzheimer s doubled. from 0.35% to 0.68%. among those who had COVID. The risk was greatest in women who were 85 and older. According to the researchers. it s unclear if COVID directly contributes to the development of Alzheimer s disease or if it speeds up degenerative changes in the brain that are already in progress.  This study shows the patients with dementia may be detected earlier due to COVID but does not suggest that the infection itself causes dementia.  said Dr. Santosh Kesari. a neurologist at Providence Saint John s Health Center in Santa Monica. California and the regional medical director for the Research Clinical Institute of Providence Southern California. The researchers hope that future studies are able to uncover the specific pathways in which COVID impacts brain function so that more targeted treatments and prevention methods can be developed. Historically. it s been difficult for scientists to develop treatments targeting cognition. according to Cahan. While researchers are looking into various medications — like antivirals. stimulants and corticosteroids — the research is still in the early stages and it s unclear how well these approaches help enhance cognition.  We have not firmly established the mechanisms of long COVID or Alzheimer s so our approach to treatment is limited.  Cahan said.This isn t the first study to find that infectious diseases are associated with cognitive decline. Past research shows that pneumonia. urinary tract infections. herpes virus infections. osteomyelitis and cellulitis have all been linked to a higher risk of dementia. According to Cahan. we also know that COVID can lead to major issues with attention and processing speed in certain patients.Some experts believe that cognitive decline is caused by the widespread inflammation that certain infections. including COVID. trigger throughout the body. Higher levels of inflammation often go hand-in-hand with cognitive problems. According to Kesari. all that systemic inflammation caused by COVID can lead to brain inflammation — and research shows that brain inflammation is at the root of Alzheimer s disease. There s also a possibility that there may be a buildup of the proteins related to Alzheimer s disease in patients who are severely ill or hospitalized. according to someresearch.  More long-term follow-up is needed to see if these proteins persist and progress. as would be expected in Alzheimer s disease.  Cahan said. It s unknown what. exactly. causes Alzheimer s disease. which is one of the major reasons why it s so hard for scientists to figure out how COVID may lead to the disease. Cahan added. Ultimately. while it s clear that COVID and brain health are connected in some way. it ll take more research — and time — to get a clearer understanding of how different diseases and infections impact brain health.  We are currently in the phase where information is accumulating that COVID-19 leads to cognitive impairment. but the mechanisms are unclear.  Cahan said.Cahan said when he sees patients seriously struggling with cognitive decline after recovering from COVID. he often refers them to occupational and speech therapy to help strengthen the parts of their brain that were weakened by the infection. Cognitive therapy. which is currently being investigated as a treatment for post COVID cognitive impairment. can also help people develop new strategies to improve their cognition.Cahan also generally recommends that people gradually build their cognitive endurance after COVID. rather than going from zero to 100 right after recovering. A healthy diet. physical activity. social connections and stress management are crucial aspects of maintaining cognitive function as well. Kesari said. If the cognitive problems persist. it s worth checking in with a doctor to see if there s anything else going on.  All patients should undergo a thorough workup to look for other potential contributors like sleep disturbance. psychological distress. metabolic disorders. vitamin deficiencies all of which have specific treatments.  Cahan said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

new abortion lawGreg AbbottTexas would get to work eliminating rapesOne year later. Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston. The numbers have stayed consistently high.  said LeBlanc. executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan. near Texas A&M University.

Even Republicans are seeing it as a line with some voters.new political battlegroundShe said she knows those who are  hardcore. never have abortion for any reason. period. And then I have the other ones that are like. ‘Well. you know. it depends.  when Abbott said last September:As of this summer. all abortions were banned in Texas except if it would save a mother s life.Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape. spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs. a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue. To prevent such heinous crimes before they happen. and to prosecute any criminals to the full extent of the law. Governor Abbott has aggressively fought against defunding the police and led bail reform efforts to prevent the release of dangerous criminals.  Eze said in a statement.More than 14.000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year. according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.Crisis centers in Texas say the number of rape victims they ve accompanied to hospitals for exams is rebounding since the pandemic restrictions kept advocates from entering. The Women s Center in Fort Worth has made more than 650 visits to counsel victims undergoing exams in the past year compared to about 340 in the year prior. said Alisha Mathenia. the assistant director of crisis services at the center.The majority of sexual assaults are never reported to police. making any available data an incomplete picture. And about 8 out of 10 sexual assaults are committed by a person known to the victim. according to the Rape. Abuse & Incest National Network. We re not talking about a large of number of rapists walking around on the street. That s a myth.  said Democrat Donna Howard. a state representative in Austin who co-authored the bill creating Abbott s task force.At The SAFE Alliance in Austin. where sexual assault victims can get exams and medical care at its Eloise House. senior director Juliana Gonzales said it s admirable for Texas to work on rape prevention.

updated COVID-19 booster shot.Joe Bidenrecent remarkThe White House said more than 5 million people received the new boosters by its own estimate that accounts for reporting lags in states.Health experts said it is too early to predict whether demand would match up with the 171 million doses of the new boosters the U.S. ordered for the fall. No one would go looking at our flu shot uptake at this point and be like. ‘Oh. what a disaster.   said Dr. David Dowdy. an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  If we start to see a large uptick in cases. I think we re going to see a lot of people getting the (new COVID) vaccine. A temporary shortage of Moderna vaccine caused some pharmacies to cancel appointments while encouraging people to reschedule for a Pfizer vaccine. The issue was expected to resolve as government regulators wrapped up an inspection and cleared batches of vaccine doses for distribution. I do expect this to pick up in the weeks ahead.  said White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha.  We ve been thinking and talking about this as an annual vaccine like the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine season picks up in late September and early October. We re just getting our education campaign going. So we expect to see. despite the fact that this was a strong start. we actually expect this to ramp up stronger. Some Americans who plan to get the shot. designed to target the most common omicron strains. said they are waiting because they either had COVID-19 recently or another booster. They are following public health advice to wait several months to get the full benefit of their existing virus-fighting antibodies.Others are scheduling shots closer to holiday gatherings and winter months when respiratory viruses spread more easily.Retired hospital chaplain Jeanie Murphy. 69. of Shawnee. Kansas. plans to get the new booster in a couple of weeks after she has some minor knee surgery. Interest is high among her neighbors from what she sees on the Nextdoor app. There s quite a bit of discussion happening among people who are ready to make appointments.  Murphy said.  I found that encouraging. For every one naysayer there will be 10 or 12 people who jump in and say. ‘You re crazy. You just need to go get the shot.  Biden later acknowledged criticism of his remark about the pandemic being over and clarified the pandemic is  not where it was.  The initial comment didn t bother Murphy. She believes the disease has entered a steady state when  we ll get COVID shots in the fall the same as we do flu shots. Experts hope she s right. but are waiting to see what levels of infection winter brings. The summer ebb in case numbers. hospitalizations and deaths may be followed by another surge. Dowdy said.Dr. Anthony Fauci. asked Thursday by a panel of biodefense experts what still keeps him up at night. noted that half of vaccinated Americans never got an initial booster dose. We have a vulnerability in our population that will continue to have us in a mode of potential disruption of our social order.  Fauci said.  I think that we have to do better as a nation. Some Americans who got the new shots said they are excited about the idea of targeting the vaccine to the variants circulating now. Give me all the science you can.  said Jeff Westling. 30. an attorney in Washington. D.C.. who got the new booster and a flu shot on Tuesday. one in each arm. He participates in the combat sport jujitsu. so wants to protect himself from infections that may come with close contact.  I have no issue trusting folks whose job it is to look at the evidence. Meanwhile. Biden s pronouncement in a  60 Minutes  interview broadcast Sunday echoed through social media. We still have a problem with COVID. We re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over.  Biden said while walking through the Detroit auto show.  If you notice. no one s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it s changing. By Wednesday on Facebook. when a Kansas health department posted where residents could find the new booster shots. the first commenter remarked snidely: But Biden says the pandemic is over. The president s statement. despite his attempts to clarify it. adds to public confusion. said Josh Michaud. associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington. People aren t sure when is the right time to get boosted. ‘Am I eligible?  People are often confused about what the right choice is for them. even where to search for that information.  Michaud said. Any time you have mixed messages. it s detrimental to the public health effort.  Michaud said.  Having the mixed messages from the president s remarks. makes that job that much harder. University of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi said he s worried the president s pronouncement has taken on a life of its own and may stall prevention efforts. That soundbite is there for a while now. and it s going to spread like wildfire. And it s going to give the impression that ‘Oh. there s nothing more we need to do.   Salemi said. If we re happy with 400 or 500 people dying every single day from COVID. there s a problem with that.  Salemi said.  We can absolutely do better because most of those deaths. if not all of them. are absolutely preventable with the tools that we have. New York City photographer Vivienne Gucwa. 44. got the new booster Monday. She s had COVID twice. once before vaccines were available and again in May. She was vaccinated with two Moderna shots. but never got the original boosters. When I saw the new booster was able to tackle omicron variant I thought. ‘I m doing that.   Gucwa said. I don t want to deal with omicron again.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough is making it clear who has the final say in deciding whether veterans in states with abortion bans can still access abortion care.He does. not Republican state attorneys general.During a Wednesday hearing before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) praised McDonough for changing VA rules this month. for the first time. to provide abortion care to veterans in cases involving rape. incest or when the life of the patient is at risk. There are currently about 300.000 female veterans of childbearing age who receive their health care under the VA health system. and many live in states where abortion is no longer available.Hirono noted that Alabama GOP Attorney General Steve Marshall is already threatening to prosecute any VA doctor who provides abortion services in his state. where abortion is now entirely banned. I would expect other Republican attorney generals. in the states where abortion is now provided. to follow suit.  Hirono told McDonough.  Mr. Secretary. what legal protections do federal employees at VA have under the interim final rule? McDonough said the Justice Department s Office of Legal Counsel had just released an opinion hours earlier. one that he requested. that concluded it is entirely  a lawful exercise of VA s authority  to provide veterans with access to reproductive health care.The Justice Department opinion also concluded that  states may not impose criminal or civil liability on VA employees ― including doctors. nurses. administrative staff ― who provide or facilitate abortions or related services in a manner authorized by federal law.  he said.  The supremacy clause of the Constitution bars state officials from penalizing VA employees for performing their federal functions. whether through criminal prosecution. license revocation proceedings. or civil litigation.  This [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion makes very clear the protections that are afforded VA providers.  McDonough added.A Marshall spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Here s a copy of the Justice Department s legal opinion laying out why the VA has the authority to provide abortion care.Unlike the Department of Health and Human Services. the VA is not bound by the Hyde Amendment. the legislative provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases where a pregnancy is caused by rape. incest or when the woman s life is at risk. But VA leaders chose to put Hyde-like restrictions in place despite the agency not being required to do so.HuffPost asked the VA earlier this month why McDonough decided to limit the VA s abortion services to cases of rape. incest or the patient s life being at risk. A department spokesman said.  At this time. VA is responding to the emergency need to protect the life and health of our nation s Veterans. McDonough said Wednesday that the decision to provide abortion services to veterans at all was in response to safety concerns. I d just reiterate the principle that led us to take this step is veteran patient safety.  he said.  We take that very. very seriously. Every health decision we make flows from that principle. ,Health News
flu shotobservational studyless likely to have a strokeischemic strokeThe 14-year study took place in Spain and followed 14.322 people who had a stroke.

When Brittany Martinez s son was 1 year old. she and her husband noticed that he wasn t meeting some developmental milestones. They had him evaluated. and he was diagnosed with autism.The diagnosis also affected Martinez s mental health. When my son was first diagnosed. I felt overwhelmed and isolated. I would often get lost in caring for his needs without realizing the toll his constant care was having on my own mental health. until I fell into a deep depression.  Martinez said.She neglected her own need for care until her husband and grandmother eventually brought her to the hospital for help. Autism Speaksstudymother s higher symptoms of depression did not predict an increase in children s behavior problems over time.  said Danielle Roubinov. the study s lead author. Roubinov told HuffPost that this finding should help alleviate feelings of guilt a parent might have about their own mental health struggles affecting their child.  When there is a child with special needs. understandably a lot of resources are directed to the child.  Roubinov said.  Equally as important is the support for caregiving parents. But parents who are fully absorbed in caring for a child may not feel able to ask for help. If they believe their child s needs must come first. then the parent s needs never get addressed.Taylor T.. who asked that HuffPost withhold her last name for privacy reasons. has a daughter who was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 20 months old and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. (The treatment is 29 months long. and  she has a great prognosis.  Taylor said). So many people say. ‘What are you doing for yourself?  which is a nice sentiment. but it just further divides me and those people.  Taylor said.  What they don t understand is that I don t have the time. the energy. or the mental capacity to do anything for myself. I am with my daughter quite literally keeping her alive 24/7. While she experienced anxiety before her child s illness. her feelings of terror were both amplified and silenced by her daughter s cancer diagnosis. I have had multiple panic attacks while alone with her in the ER in the middle of the night or if something wasn t going as planned during a chemo infusion. The hardest part is hiding those attacks. sitting down and handing her an iPad for 15 minutes. and trying to recompose myself.  she said.Taylor and other parents like her say that receiving a serious diagnosis divides their lives into a  before  and an  after.  I used to be outgoing and make friends easily.  said Taylor. explaining that she now walks around  feeling like no one understands me or what we ve been through. Except for the people who do: other parents facing the same diagnosis. Support from other moms going through the same or very similar situations has been better than any therapy I could find.  Taylor said.  I met a friend very early on who has a daughter who was just a few months ahead of us in treatment. We instantly connected and she became a constant source of understanding. I truly do not think I could have gotten through as well as I did without her. Along with her friend. Taylor regularly meets with a group of other  cancer moms  via video call. To have a group of women who really understand our day to day. and not only the medical aspects. but the emotional aspects. is priceless.  she said.For Laurie Foos. the mother of a 15-year-old son who has autism. anxiety and developmental disabilities. social media has provided a source of support.FacebookFoos said that social media.  for all of its issues. often provides a safe space for parents like myself who might not know where to turn for answers.

My greatest hope is that the PTSD that has and will go along with this experience is mine and my husband s to hold.  she said.While heart conditions. cancer and autism are vastly different diagnoses. several themes recur as these parents tell their stories: the isolation they feel. the struggle to attend to their own emotional needs when the needs of their child are so great. and the comfort they can find only in the company of others who understand what they re experiencing.Autism SpeaksLeukemia and Lymphoma SocietyJuvenile Diabetes Research FoundationUnited Cerebral PalsyParent to ParentIf you d like to connect with others locally. ask the person who coordinates your care at the hospital or doctor s office if they can put you in touch with other families.

Prescription medications are an essential item on your packing list when you re traveling. However. bringing them can require a little preparation.Before you head out. contact your physician to make sure you have your meds available for the duration of your trip. You can travel with most medications ― just remember to leave them in the prescription bottle or have the prescription note.  It s also beneficial to have a current list from your pharmacy with descriptions of each of your medications on hand. as the drugs may have different names depending on which country you re traveling to.  said Dr. Kavita Desai. a pharmacist and founder of health and wellness company Revivele. If you re traveling by plane. liquid medications are limited to travel-size containers of 3.4 ounces in the U.S. if you have them on your carry-on. Many pediatric prescriptions need refrigeration. so bring ice packs if you re packing children s medication. said Dr. Neela Sethi Young. a pediatrician and co-founder of the scrubs brand Jaanuu. In the midst of packing for your vacation. it s normal that medications may slip your mind. If you realize while traveling that you forgot your medications. it s important that you act quickly in order to avoid gaps in your prescription regimen.  Try your best to avoid stopping your medications abruptly.  Sethi Young said.  This can have serious health effects. Additionally. make sure not to change your medication or take something in its place ― e.g.. over-the-counter medicine or an alternate drug ― as that can also put your health into danger. Here s what you can do to obtain forgotten medication if you re away from home.Once you realize that you forgot a medication. get in touch with the doctor who prescribed it. Try calling their office or sending a message via your patient portal as soon as possible.  Your physician s office may be able to fax or email a note of your latest medical consultation or summary of your health conditions and medications with dosing instructions.  Desai said. If you re traveling domestically in the U.S.. they may even be able to transfer your prescription to a pharmacy near you. The pharmacy where you go to collect your prescription has a record of your medications. Therefore. if you re unable to get in touch with your doctor. contact a pharmacist back home so they can locate the exact names of your medications and associated dosing. Sethi Young said. Once you receive a copy of your medication record. take it to a local pharmacy. as you may be able to purchase your prescription medications there. Make sure to visit either a hospital-based pharmacy or a reputable chain pharmacy and insist on original packaging of the medication. Desai said.Remember to keep the receipts from your purchase. because you may get some form of reimbursement if you have travel insurance. Desai added. Each country has its own rules regarding the sale of prescription medications. So if you re denied medications after showing your prescription from your doctor. you may have to visit a local physician for a new prescription. Urgent care centers and medical clinics with internal medicine physicians are generally knowledgeable about a variety of health conditions. Desai said. She recommends that you take a list of your current medications and medical conditions from your primary care provider during a visit. Generally. internal medicine or family medicine physicians who act as general practitioners can prescribe a variety of medications. If the local internal medicine physician is unable to help with your prescription. they may refer you to a specialized physician who can. The process to retrieve your forgotten medications may seem stressful. but don t panic. There are medical professionals who can support you and help you gain access to your medicine. Sethi Young said. ,Health News
You ve surely heard the expression about one bad apple spoiling the whole bunch. While it s a metaphor for someone whose behavior makes a whole group look bad. it might also literally refer to the actual fruits and vegetables in your fridge. When you find one rotten grape in a pack or moldy bell pepper in your crisper drawer. is the produce touching these items still safe to eat? Or should you throw everything away?  While one rotten apple can spoil the bunch. it takes time to do so.  said Matt Regusci. director of growth and public relations at ASI. a company that provides food safety inspections. certifications and consulting.  There s no need to dump the whole vegetable drawer because of one rotten piece of fruit or veggie—just throw out the produce touching the rotten item. It s also likely safe to eat produce that has touched a moldy item. as long as you wash it first and eat it quickly. he added. But there are many factors to consider. Here s what you should know about how spoiled produce can affect nearby items and how to decide whether it s still OK to eat. There are hundreds of thousands of species of molds. which are microscopic fungi that live on plant and animal matter. according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mold commonly spreads by releasing spores into the air. said Vanessa Coffman. director of the Alliance to Stop Foodborne Illness. It can also spread via water or insects. So. mold can easily migrate from one piece of fruit or vegetable to another that s touching it. said Tamika Sims. senior director of food technology communications at the International Food Information Council.  It s best to first throw away the moldy produce and inspect the produce touching it for mold.  she said.  If you see mold. feel mushy skin or see discoloration. this produce must also be discarded.  And.  clean out and wipe down your fridge regularly.  especially if you ve had moldy items. Coffman added. Some molds are OK to eat. like in blue cheeses. Coffman said. Others can cause severe disease. A few molds can produce mycotoxins. which are toxins that make you sick. but most U.S. consumers aren t usually exposed to these kinds of molds. she added.Moldy foods may also have bacterial growth. It s this bacteria. not the mold itself. that usually causes foodborne illness. Coffman said. Food waste is a huge problem in the U.S. The average household wastes 32% of the food it purchases. costing consumers $240 billion a year. according to research published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics. So. it s not always necessary to throw away everything in your crisper or an entire package of strawberries just because you spot one moldy piece of produce. Coffman said.It can take a few days to a couple of weeks for fruits and vegetables to grow mold in the refrigerator or pantry. according to the Ultimate Mold Guide.But if you do see a moldy item. inspect neighboring fruits and vegetables for signs of mold (green or white fuzz) or spoilage (mushy texture or discoloration). Sims said.  Evolution has given humans amazing instincts to tell if food is safe to eat.  using sight. touch and smell. Regusci said.  First. does it look good? No mold or cracks. Does it smell good? Not funky. unless you have purposely fermented or pickled it. Does it feel right? Not super mushy. Then it should taste right.  Don t see mold growing on a fruit or vegetable that s been hanging out with a moldy item? You can usually wash the produce and eat it later. The USDA recommends washing produce under running tap water and avoiding using soap or detergent.  The likelihood of getting ill from one of the fresh items that have been touching a rotten one in the U.S. is low. especially if you are a person without underlying health conditions.  Coffman said. People with mold allergies or compromised immune systems could be at risk for illness. though. The USDA mostly recommends throwing away foods that display mold but suggests that some foods can still be eaten if you remove the mold. For example. on firm fruits and vegetables with low moisture content. like cabbage. bell peppers and carrots. you can cut off at least an inch around and below a small mold spot. Just avoid touching the moldy spot with your knife so you don t cross-contaminate the produce. However. soft produce with high moisture content. like tomatoes. peaches and cucumbers. should be thrown away if they show mold. Coffman said mold on the surface can mean the  mold has also rooted deeply below.  If the food is contaminated with a mycotoxin-producing mold. the toxins spread throughout the item.Never sniff moldy items. as you could inhale the mold spores. which could cause respiratory illness. People can also get sick from skin contact with moldy foods. Coffman said. Keep in mind. too. that just because the food looks OK or you ve removed the moldy bits. it could be unsafe to eat. Pathogens. like e.coli. listeria and salmonella. aren t visible to the naked eye. There isn t much you can do when inspecting produce at the grocery store to tell if it s harboring something that might make you sick.  Coffman said.  What you can do is wash your produce. cook it when possible and keep an eye out for recalls and public health notices.  She also suggested keeping raw meats and other foods from cooked foods. washing your hands frequently while cooking and handling food. and placing a kitchen thermometer in the refrigerator to ensure it s set at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit to keep molds and bacteria from growing.  If you do end up accidentally eating something moldy and have an allergic reaction. seek medical help.  Coffman said.  Symptoms can include a sudden onset of shortness of breath. nausea. fever or diarrhea.  ,Health News
Joe BidenWhile touring the North American International Auto Show in Detroit with Biden. CBS correspondent Scott Kelley asked the president whether the pandemic was over. considering the return of in-person events and lack of masking requirements. The pandemic is over.  Biden replied.  We still have a problem with COVID. We re still doing a lot of work on it … but the pandemic is over.   If you notice. no one s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it s changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.  the president added.The president s claims of the pandemic being finished are largely overshadowed by recent COVID-19 data in the U.S.In the last month. there have been 2.2 million new infections reported in the U.S.. with 13.606 deaths. according to John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. According to the New York Times COVID-19 tracker. the U.S. is averaging around 465 deaths per day.Just last week. the head of the World Health Organization said at a United Nations COVID briefing that the end of the global pandemic  was in sight.  We are not there yet. But the end is in sight.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a virtual press conference.Biden battled COVID-19 in July and continued to test positive weeks after he contracted the virus. First lady Jill Biden also contracted COVID-19 in late August in a  rebound  case.Biden said in January that COVID-19 is  here to stay  but offered optimism on how the virus will be handled in the future. Having COVID in the environment and in the world is probably here to stay. but COVID as we re dealing with it now is not here to stay.  Biden said at that time.

An hour after we received my husband Kai s lung cancer diagnosis. we went outside to walk the dog. The walls of our kitchen seemed far too tight ― the air thick and hard to breathe.At first. we didn t say anything. We just gripped each other s hands like we were clinging to life. On the street corner. Kai stumbled a bit. grabbed onto our neighbor s stone retaining wall. He looked at the November sky. the nearly bare trees. the dog. Then he looked at me. Will I make it to 60?  he asked.The cogs in my mind whirled and clicked. I counted in my head. mentally tore pages from the calendar. December. January. February... June. Less than seven months away. I reached and grabbed his shoulders until he looked me in the eyes.  We ll get you to 60. How logical. commanding and certain I sounded. Strong. In charge.After months of antibiotics for a sinus infection Kai didn t have. weeks of headaches and more coughing and low-grade fevers. a referral to an ENT specialist and prescribed irrelevant treatments. the doctor sent him for a last-ditch X-ray. They found the mass in his lung. By the time it was discovered. the tumor was already 14 centimeters. And it had metastasized. Kai was a stage IV dead man walking. Unlike cancers such as prostate and breast cancer. for which the survival rates have steadily increased over the last half a century due to simple factors such as awareness and routine screenings. lung cancer survival rates are low. The diagnosis nearly always comes too late to do anything but start therapies like chemo and radiation ― things that treat but can t cure. Kai was. for a 59-year-old man. incredibly healthy. He ate all the right things (I know because I was the cook in the family). exercised every day. saw doctors regularly. A former football cornerback. he had no known risk factors and no warning signs. In fact. he d passed a full battery of physicals and X-rays and blood tests in preparation for an elective knee replacement surgery only a year prior. But cancer found him anyway. The tumor went from nothing to enormous. growing an average of 1.16 centimeters per month. How long?  we asked the doctor.We were determined not to use the internet for medical information. We promised each other. Google The average is 18 months.  Kai s doctor told us. He quickly followed with.  But that takes into account all patients. most of whom are much older and sicker. far less healthy than you are. with multiple risk factors. We have every reason to believe you will far exceed the average. He added.  Let s focus on the kind of life you want to live ― what you want to do with your time. On Sept.12. the 60th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy s  Moonshot  address to the nation. President Joe Biden announced plans for  another moonshot: ending cancer as we know it. Like most of us. Biden is no stranger to the impotent pain of having a loved one suffer from the disease. His son. Beau. died from cancer in 2015 at the age of 46. The fact of the disease is bad enough. but the complete inability to do anything at all is a feeling of helplessness and loneliness like no other.The president launched the Cancer Cabinet in February 2022. and in July. its priorities were to. among other goals. improve cancer screening. decrease cancer s impact. and support both patients and caregivers. Specifically. Biden s moonshot prioritizes biotechnology research and creates a new governmental agency dedicated to  biomedical innovation that supports the health of all Americans.  More than 100 main types of cancer exist. Lung cancer comes in two flavors. Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for about 90% of all lung cancers and itself comes in three kinds. Kai. with his squamous cell carcinoma. was one of the more than 2 million people worldwide — about the population of Chicago. home to his beloved Cubs — served that diagnosis in 2017 alone. and in the disease s advanced stages. it was too late to send it back to the kitchen:  No. thank you. This is not what I ordered.  The two treatment options for him were equally repulsive and ordered together: chemotherapy s chemicals through the bloodstream and radiation s X-rays to a localized area. Neither therapy distinguishes between healthy and cancerous cells. each kills both.But the doctor told us that. because of Kai s overall health. he was a candidate for a cutting-edge treatment: immunotherapy. By 2017. it had shown great promise in clinical trials. A moonshot of sorts. albeit on an individual scale.Designed to attack invaders while protecting citizen cells. the human immune system learns a new language through this treatment. Instead of targeting the cancer directly. immunotherapy overhauls the body s communication network to activate all defenses toward the destruction of the cancerous. once-normal. cells.It would not cure him — a cure was not possible — but immunotherapy could lead to long-lasting remission and increased survival time.The out-of-pocket cost. the doctor told us. was about $500. a minuscule price to pay for something that might give more time.  Yes. yes.  we said.  absolutely yes. Isn t this what we all want — both for ourselves and for the people we love? More time? Such a human desire to continue life at any cost. To spare no expense and no treatment. to prolong the inevitable for us all.The doctor ordered a battery of genetic tests for markers to determine appropriateness.The bill we later received turned out to be closer to 100 times the cost we had been quoted. And it made no difference. Kai s profile was not a match. And despite the prognosis — enough time still to live — he died just five months after his diagnosis. Five weeks before his 60th birthday. He was supposed to have made it longer. I said so. The doctor said so. Even the internet said so. But how much life is enough. when we can t have forever?I guess the answer is. like any toddler would tell you. more. Whatever we get. more is what we want. This goal is always the moonshot. no matter how ambitious and unlikely to succeed. We feel we have to try. down to the last possible Hail Mary pass. Giving up is the only real failure. And we did try. with everything modern medicine could offer. Kai s medical team took a moonshot with his weekly chemo and daily radiation. more treatment than most cancer patients can bear. Kai was so strong he never even looked sick. never stopped eating and never lost his hair. Right up to the very end. Kai was recognizably himself: handsome. strong. loving and wickedly funny.Five years later. I still have so much to learn about who I am as a widow ― not a wife. It s too late for Kai. and for Beau. and for the other 1 in every 6 people on earth who have already died from cancer — each of them a parent. sibling. child. partner. friend. All of them loved. But I hope with all my heart that Biden s moonshot finds its mark. If some cancers might eventually be cured and other cancers can join the  vaccine available  ranks of illnesses like COVID and chicken pox and the flu. maybe we can break some of grief s stranglehold over us. at least long enough to fully live the lives we wanted.Helene Kiser is the author of  Topography.

When I wasWhen she got home. she was devastated. So was I. because I d always wanted a little sister. I d been thrilled when my mother s belly started to grow. and people began congratulating her everywhere we went.She d remarried less than a year before that. and the transition of having a new man in the house had been tough for my younger brother and me. A new baby was something we could all rally around. so it was especially difficult for all of us when my mom started experiencing complications.At the beginning of her second trimester. right after she d started telling people she was pregnant. she began bleeding and cramping. I spent a lot of afternoons at my cousin s house while my mom attended doctor appointments. She d return to pick me up. and I d find her whispering in the driveway with my aunt. One night after dinner. we had a family meeting where she told us that the baby had a heart problem and would need surgery right after it was born.The bleeding continued. and there were more doctor appointments and late-afternoon pickups and whispered conversations. A few weeks later. my mom went to Boston. When she returned. a new word was added to my second-grade vocabulary: miscarriage. At the time. I was old enough to know the baby was gone. but too young to understand or remember any specifics.Still. my mom s  miscarriage  shaped my perception of pregnancy. I understood its fragility.In the fall of 2017. just as the Memphis air was turning from humid to crisp. my mom and I went for one of our regular morning walks. She was between chemo treatments for the stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma she was battling. and I had just taken my first positive pregnancy test. I hadn t told her yet. My mom didn t even know my husband and I were trying. I was only about four weeks pregnant. and I was afraid of getting her hopes up at a time when she really needed things to believe in. so I decided to wait to share my news until my doctor detected a heartbeat at the six-week appointment and I had an ultrasound picture to show her.As we walked under the canopy of brown and burnt orange leaves. I asked her questions about when she was pregnant with me:  How did you feel? What was it like? Did it hurt?  This was something I d started doing about many different topics ― I sought out information I wanted to know from her and asked questions while she was still around to answer them.But that morning. my mom didn t have many answers about when she was pregnant with me.  I don t remember.  she told me.  You forget the hard parts. so you can do it again. We walked around a big curve in the road. and I thought about the poppy seed-sized embryo inside of me. My mom turned to look at me. I expected her to offer some insight about morning sickness or food cravings. but she changed the subject. You know it had genetic abnormalities. too?  she said out of nowhere. Actually. I didn t know this. because she never talked about the baby she lost.  My body kept trying to abort it. but it couldn t. That s why I kept hemorrhaging.  Her voice was faraway as she mentally traveled back to that time.Now. almost four years after my mom s death and five years after that conversation. I still remember it vividly — the crunch of leaves under our feet. the exact bend of that road. the mild weather of the day. The moment was a glimpse into the experiences of my mom s that I could never access ― a reminder that she d die with so many untold stories.One day last summer. as I watched my two kids playing under the bright pink blooms of the crepe myrtles in our backyard. I began bleeding. It was a very early miscarriage. nothing like what my mom had been through. But it still made me think of her and that conversation. I couldn t know the extent of her much-worse tragedy. but I. too. was experiencing a third pregnancy that would never be. My miscarriage — this third baby that would not be — made me feel connected to her.It wasn t until last month. when Tennessee s total abortion ban went into effect. that I finally understood my mom didn t have a miscarriage. Technically. legally. she had an abortion.Tennessee s ban is one of the strictest in the country. It does not include an exception for incest or rape. or for the life of the mother. Instead. the law offers the possibility of an  affirmative defense.  which allows the doctor. if charged with a Class C felony. to argue that an abortion was necessary  to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment to a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. That s why I kept hemorrhaging.I had to know what happened in Boston. I was almost certain the pregnancy had put my mom s life at risk and that she d had to get an abortion. but I needed corroboration. I called my great-aunt who lives in Boston. and she immediately answered the questions I d never known to ask.  Yes. it was an abortion.  my great-aunt told me.  It wasn t a viable pregnancy. It was endangering your mom s life. It was an extremely difficult situation. and she d had to travel to Boston for the procedure because it wasn t legal in Tennessee. My great-aunt didn t remember the specifics about why the pregnancy wasn t viable. I knew there was only one person who d been to those appointments with my mom and might know everything: my former stepdad. It took me weeks to text him. We hadn t spoken since their acrimonious divorce. the year after I graduated from college. I wasn t even sure he d be receptive to these questions. The experience was so long ago. and it had been so painful.But he was immediately responsive. and willing to share the details he remembered. He told me the fetus had a chromosomal abnormality. misshapen kidneys. a hole in the heart. and structures at the esophagus and rectum that prevented the processing of amniotic fluids. My mom s health was also at risk because she kept bleeding. The neonatologist said they needed to make a decision.The specialist referred them to an abortion clinic in Tulsa. Oklahoma. When my mom called the clinic for more information. the receptionist warned her that patients were usually harassed when entering the facility. So my mom called her aunt in Boston. and she connected her to a doctor at a hospital there. They sought counsel from their Episcopal priest and diocesan bishop. They consulted another doctor in Memphis. Ultimately. the doctor in Boston reaffirmed that the fetus was not viable and wouldn t live if carried to term. Because of this. and because of the risk to my mom s health. they decided to proceed with the abortion.I ll never know what my mom experienced during that procedure. Though it was an abortion ― and a choice she made ― she still considered it a  miscarriage.  and went on to describe it that way to the few close friends with whom she discussed it. I know it was traumatic. and that is why my family never talked about it. Most importantly. I know it was a procedure my mom needed for her safety. and one that other women will need for their own.Chrissy Teigen recently revealedThere are so many reasons why someone may not admit that they ve had an abortion ― from fear and grief to the nightmarish political climate and simply wanting to keep their medical decisions private ― and all of them are valid. The bottom line is abortion needs to be safe. legal and accessible for anyone who wants or needs one.want Lindsey Graham to understand the devastating effect that a federal 15-week abortion ban would have on the health of women and people with uteruses. I know she d want voters to support candidates who champion abortion rights. And I believe she d be proud of me for speaking up now and telling her story in the hope that it might matter ― that it might mean something and maybe even help do something.Ultimately. she d want women to have access to the procedure that protected her life. And she d want them to have it regardless of where they are in their pregnancy. or which state they live in.Sarah Hunter Simanson received her MFA from Vermont College of Fine Arts.

abortionsent himThe sweeping ban completely outlaws abortion. with exceptions for rape and incest victims within a limited window of time ― up to eight weeks for adults and up to 14 weeks for children ― and in cases of medical emergencies. Justice touted these provisions Friday as  reasonable and logical exceptions. medically unnecessary It is going to shut down that abortion clinic. of that. I feel certain.  state Sen. Robert Karnes (R). one of the bill s supporters. said in reference to West Virginia s sole remaining abortion clinic during the state Senate s vote Tuesday. Reproductive rights activists slammed Justice for the way he rationalized passing the bill.  Is it ‘reasonable  to re-traumatize survivors of sexual assault who need an abortion by forcing them to report to law enforcement and show their doctor a police report before they can get the care they need?  Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson tweeted at Justice on Friday.  Is it ‘logical  to make patients wait until they re on the brink of death to get a life-saving abortion? The criminal penalties outlined in the bill will go into effect in 90 days. Doctors who perform abortions banned under the law can face up to a decade in prison. in placeAbortion patients in West Virginia were already required to undergo state-directed counseling discouraging them from terminating their pregnancies and then forced to wait another 24 hours before getting treatment. Patients are also banned from using telemedicine to receive abortion care. and parents of minors seeking abortions must be notified before the minor can get the procedure. ,Health News
stopped booking shows overseasThe year I turned 30. I lived in New York City with my cello. two adopted tabby cats and my boyfriend. Brian. He and I ran a contemporary classical ensemble. We pieced together gigs and part-time jobs to support ourselves while focusing on presenting works by living composers. After securing artist management. we booked many concerts around the country for the upcoming season. I had also committed to a three-week tour in East Asia with another band. Finally. my dream of performing for a living and traveling the world to play music felt within reach. Yet something stood in my way.For five years. I had not boarded an airplane because I felt too afraid. Until I was 25. I flew occasionally. but never comfortably. A psychiatrist diagnosed me with panic disorder as a teenager. and flying emerged as a top trigger. Every bit of turbulence made me brace for a nosedive. I trembled in my seat and stared out the window as though fixating on the earth would help the aircraft stay up. During a trip to visit a college boyfriend in Slovenia. I hyperventilated until a flight attendant asked me to lie on the floor with an oxygen mask.Did I inherit a distrust of planes from my father. who couldn t travel by air until his 30s? Or did the crash scene in the movie  Alive  trigger my catastrophic thinking? Whatever the reason. I irrationally believed that jetting through the sky put me in danger. and I inadvertently gathered  evidence  to prove myself right. Landing was always my favorite part because. from my distorted view. it felt miraculous.needWhen Brian optimistically surprised me with tickets to the Bahamas (with a secret plan to propose). we got as far as the jetway before I froze. He squeezed my hand and reasoned with me. In desperation. he tried to pull me forward. but I flailed my limbs in all directions and cried  Noooo!  until he let go. I sank to the linoleum floor and propped myself against my carry-on. Brian sat next to me in silence. After our flight departed. he turned to me and said.  I think you need to find some help.  I know. I m so sorry.  I said. My heart ached.With four months before the tour abroad. I promised to change. Practicing religiously on a flight simulator program made me believe that I could fly a real plane. but I still could not set foot on one. A neurolinguistic programming practitioner in Australia hypnotized me over the phone. Six sessions later. I felt the same. My therapist recommended a support group at LaGuardia Airport. I made some phobic friends. but I still did not fly.As a last-ditch effort. I booked a $49  test  flight from New York to Boston to visit my grandma.A week later. I watched as other passengers departed and the waiting area emptied. I saw an apparition of myself give a ticket to the attendant and walk casually down the jetway. The real me drifted out the airport exit and slid into a taxi. The shabby seats felt soothing. as did the bouquet of dirty leather. sweat and gasoline that invaded my nostrils. Nice trip?  the driver asked. Oh yeah.  I said.What a sham. I wanted to change myself without taking a risk.The next day. I backed out of the China tour. knowing they would never hire me again. Then Brian gently suggested I sub out of next season s concerts.For weeks. I disappeared into our beige sectional couch. numbing myself with reruns of  Dawson s Creek.  Vibrant images of my bandmates in Beijing peppered my Facebook feed. while I felt humiliated and powerless. I worried Brian might leave me. Unwilling to accept my failure to conquer a self-created problem. I decided to try once more. A Google search led me to a program at the Anxiety and Phobia Treatment Center in White Plains. New York. that ended with a graduation flight. I signed up immediately.Dr. Martin Sief. a psychiatrist and recovered aviophobe. founded Freedom to Fly to help others overcome their phobias as he had. For six weeks. we met pilots. accepted our fears. discussed panic management and boarded a stationary plane for desensitization. Most importantly. I had an individual counselor. Barbara Bonder. who put me so at ease that I wanted to adopt her as my second mother. Having tackled a different phobia than mine. she knew how to listen intently and when to steer me back on track. Leigh. you re not getting it. You re justifying your fears.  she said.  Label your anxious thinking — give it a name. if you want. Then tell that voice to shut up. I named my  what if  voice  Fred.  Fred wondered if the graduation flight would crash. Stop it. Fred. Go away.  I said. What will it feel like as your body explodes?  he asked. SHUT UP. FRED.  I said.  This is anxiety. I m not in danger.  How can you be wrong if you feel something so strongly?  he asked.  Because I m broken. My mind is clearly broken.  I said. out loud. while walking down Broadway. If I couldn t trust my own thoughts. feelings and instincts. then who or what could I trust? Nothing made sense anymore. I only knew that Barbara expected to see me at LaGuardia s Delta terminal at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. May 20 ― two days from now ― and that I had to show up. I clung to this thought like a castaway to driftwood.Two days later. I met the class and Barbara at LaGuardia. From the security line. I called Brian. my mom. my dad and my grandma to say that I loved them. just in case. When we reached the jetway. I stopped dead. but Barbara hooked her arm in mine and pulled me forward. This time. I didn t resist.A flight attendant welcomed us as we stepped onto the plane. and I just stared in response. Barbara nudged me down the aisle to my window seat and sat down next to me. Immediately. I buckled and tightened my seat belt. and she asked to see my comfort items. Fat teardrops fell on a photo of Brian holding a puppy.  Hey! Stop crying.  Barbara said.  Look around you. Do you see anyone else crying?  She put her face close to mine. I think of this as our  Moonstruck  moment. like when Cher slapped Nicolas Cage and told him to  snap out of it. As the plane bumped and bounced along the runway. I circled words in a magazine that started with the letters  th  ― a way to keep my mind occupied so catastrophic thoughts couldn t take over ― and read affirming cue cards. The buildings along the horizon began to blur. Then the nose tilted upward. and with a shudder. we lifted from the ground.For the next three minutes. I closed my eyes and measured time with a 5-5-5 breathing method. Inhale. hold. exhale. repeat. By the time we reached 10.000 feet. the plane s engines slowed a bit as the upward tilt of its body eased. I opened my eyes and turned to Barbara.  I m flying.  I whispered.  You re flying.  she said with a grin. Once we landed. she hugged me and said:  The first 10 times are the hardest. Keep at it.  I hadn t thought about what came next. Forming a new habit would take repetition over time. This I knew from a lifetime of practicing the cello. I flew every week for nine weeks. Then I flew every month for six months to play concerts with Brian and our chamber group. Two months later I traveled from New York to New Delhi. India. and even fell asleep. Halfway across the Atlantic. the plane rocked and swayed so much that it woke me up. I looked at my friend. who sat next to me and seemed nervous.  Don t worry.  I said.  We re riding waves in the air. just like a boat rides waves in the ocean. It s normal.  With that. I fell back asleep.

Mississippi s capital city We have restored clean water.  Reeves said during a news conference.But a state health department official. Jim Craig. said concerns remain about copper and lead levels in the Jackson water. Craig said people should continue to avoid using city water to prepare baby formula.Emergency repairs are still underway after problems at Jackson s main water treatment plant caused most customers to lose service for several days in late August and early September.Problems started days after torrential rain fell in central Mississippi. altering the quality of the raw water entering Jackson s treatment plants. That slowed the treatment process. depleted supplies in water tanks and caused a precipitous drop in pressure.When water pressure drops. there s a possibility that untreated groundwater can enter the water system through cracked pipes. so customers are told to boil water to kill potentially harmful bacteria.But even before the rainfall. officials said some water pumps had failed and a treatment plant was using backup pumps. Jackson had already been under a boil-water notice for a month because the state health department had found cloudy water that could make people ill.The National Guard and volunteer groups have distributed millions of bottles of drinking water in Jackson since late August.Jackson is the largest city in one of the poorest statesLike many American cities. Jackson struggles with aging infrastructure with water lines that crack or collapse. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. a Democrat in a Republican-led state. said the city s water problems come from decades of deferred maintenance.Some equipment froze at Jackson s main water treatment plant during a cold snap in early 2020. leaving thousands of customers with dangerously low water pressure or no water at all. The National Guard helped distribute drinking water. People gathered water in buckets to flush toilets. Similar problems happened on a smaller scale earlier this year.Jackson frequently has boil-water notices because of loss of pressure or other problems that can contaminate the water. Some of the mandates are in place for only a few days. while others last weeks. Some only affect specific neighborhoods. usually because of broken pipes in the area. Others affect all customers on the water system.,Health News

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that there is clearly  conflict  within the Republican Party on the issue of abortion. considering that many GOP lawmakers have been muted in response to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introducing a national abortion ban bill. There are those in the party that think that life begins at the candlelight dinner the night before.  Pelosi said at her weekly press conference. sending at least one reporter into a fit of laughter. And these people are in defiance of that.  she continued. referring to Republicans who don t want to talk about Graham s bill.  That s what you re seeing there. But we are united in our support for a woman s right to choose. ban abortion nationwideRepublicans Most of the members in my conference prefer this be dealt with at the state level.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters. I. for one. want to focus on the inflation numbers that came out today.  said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).  That s what people are talking about. Pelosi said she noticed a clip of Graham on TV earlier in the day. a replay of footage from August showing him argue that abortion matters should be decided at the state level.probably at the insistence of the MAGA grassroots coming out and saying there should be a federal ban.  referencing former President Donald Trump s  Make America Great Again  slogan.

Republicanslegislationabortionrolled it outAs prevalent as the expression is. it s a political construct that s meaningless in a medical sense. doctors and experts on reproductive rights have said for years ― and words matter when they re being used to legislate around people s bodies. The phrase ‘late-term abortion  is a political buzzword. not medical terminology.  Dr. Katie McHugh. an OB-GYN in Indiana and board chair with Physicians for Reproductive Health. told HuffPost. Abortion bans based on gestational age are especially offensive because they are based only in ideology. not in medical science or common sense.  she said.guideanother bill13 weeksIt s likely that the people behind these bans ― many of whom would like to see abortion banned at every stage of pregnancy ― aren t actually concerned with the specifics here. but rather with the powerful imagery that a phrase like  late-term abortion  invokes.guide Such misleading. harmful language has no basis in medicine and ignores the realities faced by those seeking abortion care.  Katherine Gillespie. acting director of federal policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. told HuffPost.Former President Donald Trump repeatedly brought up  late-term abortions  during his campaign rallies. then proceeded to describe doctors  ripping babies straight from the mother s womb. right up until the very moment of birth  ― an illustration that has no basis in reality.While there are any number of reasons someone might wait to seek out an abortion after the first trimester of pregnancy ― because laws in their state made the procedure complicated and time-consuming to access. say. or because a fetal anomaly came to light ― the anti-abortion movement s language around those circumstances is nearly always stigmatizing and full of violent descriptions of a generally safe procedure.tweetedLawmakers  descriptions of  late-term abortions  nearly always involve graphic and disturbing accounts of fetal pain. and Tuesday s bill is no exception. Though the proposed legislation rests on the argument that there s strong evidence from  recent medical research and analysis  that a fetus has the capacity for pain after 15 weeks of pregnancy. ACOG is unwavering in its position. The science conclusively establishes that a human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until after at least 24-25 weeks.  the group says.  Every major medical organization that has examined this issue and peer-reviewed studies on the matter have consistently reached the conclusion that abortion before this point does not result in the perception of pain in a fetus. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story referred to a claim that a fetus can experience pain  before 15 weeks of pregnancy.  It should have read  after 15 weeks of pregnancy. ,Health News

Hanna SmithsaidThis behavior — anonymously sharing hurtful content about yourself online — is known by researchers and psychologists as  digital self-harm.  and awareness of the problem has grown in recent years.study  We still don t know what comes first.  Justin W. Patchin. the study s lead author. told HuffPost.  But we know they are connected. Patchin. a professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. said that he was shocked upon learning of the Smith case and has since worked with colleagues on several studies around digital self-harm in teens.  Digital self-harm occurs when an individual creates an anonymous online account and uses it to publicly send hurtful messages or threats to one s self.  Patchin told HuffPost.  Most commonly ... it manifests as threats or targeted messages of hate — the more extreme and rare forms of cyberbullying. isstudyLike cutting and similar behaviors. digital self-harm is often a cry for help. This is not something that kids do just because they think it s cool.  Cindy Graham. a child psychologist in Maryland. told HuffPost.  They see it as a way to deal with the problem that they re experiencing. Crisis Text Line Digital self-harm can be a way of drawing attention or sympathy for a teen who is struggling and does not feel equipped to ask for help directly.  Turner told HuffPost. Patchin said some of the young people in his research who had engaged in digital self-harm  reported issues with low self-esteem or self-hate.  Others. he said.  did it to be funny or because they wanted attention. In some cases. teens are looking for a certain kind of attention from specific people. posting the remarks online as a sort of test to see if friends will come to their defense.  If there is then the expectation of ‘I ll get a lot of feedback because of this.  then if they don t get that feedback. that can actually worsen symptoms of depression.  said Graham. Bullying and self-harm. either separately or apart. are increasingly an issue for teens. At Crisis Text Line.  conversations about bullying increased by 20% in 2021 compared to 2020. and conversations about self-harm increased by 10% compared to 2020.  Turner said. Unfortunately. parents often have no idea that their child is engaging in digital self-harm. Patchin said he has seen cases in which a child was revealed as the source of their own bullying only after worried parents involved authorities.Because it s impossible to keep tabs on everything that teens do online. and because they are often highly skilled in circumventing parents  digital safeguards — using web browsers to access restricted apps. or creating multiple social media profiles. for example — your best source of information is usually your own child. The best we can do as parents is be there for our kids. so if they are experiencing anything hurtful — online or off — they feel comfortable turning to us for help.  said Patchin. Graham warned against interpreting self-harm as young people  doing it for attention.  That s not the way you want to react to it. [by] dismissing it. because if anything. it can escalate the behavior or cause even more of a regression in how they re functioning. so it can lead to more intense cries for help.  she said. Knowing that you are willing to discuss their mental health issues — and can do so without judgment — opens the door for them to talk about their struggles. You should also encourage children to tell a trusted adult if they are worried that one of their friends may be at risk.  I usually am pretty hesitant about recommending that kids say something to the kid themselves.  Graham said. adding that a school guidance counselor is often a safe. neutral figure to whom a child can anonymously report concern about a friend.  It s never too early to start having those conversations.  she said. since kids may witness instances of bullying or self-harm as soon as they start going online.It can be helpful to keep in touch with the parents of your child s friends. who may hear about an issue with your child before you do.The signs that your teen may be contemplating or engaging in self-harm are similar to those for depression. In fact. Patchin said that in his first study on the topic. his team found that any kind of bullying  was associated with digital self-harm. as well as drug use. depressive symptoms. and offline — physical — self-harm. Parents should be alert to changes in their teen. Turner advised. In addition to behavior like cutting or drug and alcohol use. parents might notice a  loss of interest in activities. changes in friendship circles. withdrawing from friends. increased or decreased sleep. increased or decreased appetite. changes in grades or participation in school activities.  she said.Turner stressed the importance of open communication and a lack of judgment on your part. Most important is to know your child and communicate openly with them as early as you can about their mood swings and your willingness to discuss their mental health.  she said.You should never doubt whether to ask your child if they are thinking about harming themselves. Always ask.  Turner emphasized.  This will not cause them to attempt suicide or self-harm. ,Health News

Joe Bidencancer moonshotSpeaking at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston 60 years after the building s namesake gave his famed moonshot speech. Biden appealed to Americans across political lines. saying the nation was poised to end the disease  as we know it. The president harked back to the Kennedy era. comparing the effort to the space race and Americans  ultimate journey to the moon. I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone. the same national purpose that will serve to energize and measure the best of our skills. to end cancer as we know it. and even cure cancer once and for all.  he said.The effort aims to slash U.S. fatalities from cancers by 50% over the next quarter century and see many more cancers become chronic conditions that are treatable rather than fatal. Cancer is expected to kill more than 609.000 Americans in 2022. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. a toll exceeded only by deaths from heart disease.Biden added that the plan was  bold. ambitious. and. I might add. completely doable.  pointing to existing technology and the promise of medical advancements. This cancer moonshot is one of the reasons why I ran for president.  Biden said.  Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn t care if you re a Republican or a Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together. Dr. Renee WegrzynBiden said he will sign a new executive order ensuring that such treatments are manufactured in America. an effort he said would enable the country to lead  the world in biotechnology and biomanufacturing. creating jobs and strengthening the supply chain.  It s not enough to invent technology that saves lives.  Biden said.  We need to manufacture advanced biotechnologies here in the United States. The cancer moonshot was first announced in February. and Biden has long urged the nation to come together to eradicate or ease the burden of the disease.The president s son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015.,Health News

I was elated to become a first-time mother at the age of 40. but afterward I was quite certain I was  one and done.  I even began a Medium blog of the same name. Though my first birth experience was exhilarating in some ways. and I was thrilled to become a mother. my unexpected emergency C-section had left me feeling raw and confused. as well as a lengthy bout of postpartum depression that took me over a year to climb out of. Cut to 2019. with the world at the cusp of the pandemic. My husband and I found ourselves feeling fully recovered from the traumas of baby one. and ready to try for baby two after all. We already had a boy. and while I would be delighted to have had any baby. I had hopes to add a girl to the family. Yet. month after month passed with no blue line. It made sense. I was going on 43. and every article I absorbed offered dismaying tidbits. like that by age 44. the chance of spontaneous pregnancy dropped to zero. discouraging me from thinking I d be getting pregnant using the old fashioned  penis-in-the-vagina method. The average age of first-time mothers ranges from 26 to 32. but according to the CDC. the rate of women having babies in their 40s has been steadily rising about 3% each year since 1982. Some 100.000 Americans over 40 have babies every year. a number that has doubled since 1990. The truth is. I didn t mean to have a baby at age 46. But my partner and I didn t even meet until I was 31. and a few years passed before we felt ready (financially. among other things) to start a family together. By the time we felt prepared to start trying to procreate. the bulk of my 30s were in my rearview mirror. After I started trying at age 38. a series of issues lengthened my timeline— it took me eight years to have two children. Over age 35. expecting women are considered to be carrying  geriatric pregnancies  ― a term which means problems and complications. like placenta previa and miscarriage. are more likely to occur. As a result. in vitro fertilization (IVF) and donor eggs are heavily pushed onto women. both of which are pricey. medically intense and come with their own risks. I didn t want to go through IVF. and my insurance wouldn t cover it. so my OBGY recommended we first test my hormone levels. I left a few vials of blood at a strip mall lab and shortly after. she reported via phone call that my levels were on the low side of average. which meant a pregnancy wasn t completely impossible! So I began peeing on FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) sticks to track my ovulation and banged on a schedule in hopes of fertilizing one lucky egg. I got very serious about the limited things I could control to help it happen. I completely quit drinking and gave my diet a major overhaul. I stuck to a regular exercise routine. I experimented with some herbs. like stinging nettle. and ate a teaspoon of honey every morning and night for its anti-inflammatory properties.I sucked down every article and book and study I could find on pregnancy for women in their mid-40s. I interviewed friends who had had success or knew people who had to try to find any tiny detail that could help me. I joined a Facebook group of women over 40 trying to conceive. I meditated. I thought good  babyful  thoughts. But the years passed with no luck. I ran into friends who had conceived second children and. while happy for them. I felt sad for myself. I wondered if I could be an adoptive parent. I called an agency and downloaded the application. ruminating on the idea. I even began to consider the costs and hardship of IVF. calling one of the reportedly best area doctors. who was based in New Jersey. The doctor won t even consider working with you unless you use a donor egg.  the intake specialist announced. I hung up. deflated. Where the hell was I going to find a donor egg? Some days I could barely find my keys. And then. after three years of trying. it happened.Because I was so in tune with my cycles from using the FSH sticks. in conjunction with the connected app which tracked my fertility with scary accuracy. I knew I was pregnant two days after I missed my period. At a routine doctor s appointment. I requested a pregnancy test.  Congratulations!  the nurse reported back to me minutes later. I felt sick with joy. While I was thrilled to have gotten pregnant with a baby at the age of 45. I was also pregnant with worry. Would it take? Would it be healthy? Will there even be drinkable water in five years? There were real medical concerns. as well. Rates of complications such as gestational diabetes. higher birth weight. stillbirth. C-section delivery rates and Down syndrome increase as maternal age does. All the things that could go wrong danced around in my head. but much to my surprise and delight. I passed test after test. My myriad blood draws and genetic tests came back fine. As my July due date loomed. contractions began. But then they stopped. Then they started again. Then they stopped. After three days of exhaustive contractions that came on in the night and lasted until the wee morning hours. I had to accept that my labor wasn t progressing. A trip to the doctor s office confirmed I had only dilated 1.5 centimeters. Despite three days of crushing midbody pain. according to medical guidelines. my labor hadn t even actually begun. As I sat in my hospital bed. the decision was easy for me. While having a C-section tops my list of least fun things I ve ever done. I was excited to meet my baby — the girl I d been dreaming about. for so. so long. I felt absolute elation when I heard my second baby s first cries. After three long years. my baby girl had safely arrived. Later. I asked one of the nurses.  Am I one of the oldest moms you ve seen in here?  She laughed.  We see women in their 40s all the time.  she said.  A few days ago. we had a mom deliver who was 51! While my last birth took me close to three years to fully recover from. this time. recovery was a snap. I was mostly without family or visitors. I couldn t see my son or let him meet his new sister for the four days following surgery due to COVID restrictions. and also the fact that my husband was caring for our son ― but I felt fine being alone to bond with the new baby. Looking back. I can say that giving birth for the second time. now at age 46. was a truly enjoyable experience. In fact. it was fucking awesome. I felt and feel like a powerhouse lady wizard who. with an assist from Ma Nature. made a human using just my mind and my vagina. I guess my partner helped a little. too. The road to my second pregnancy was long. At one point. I gave in to the fact that it probably wouldn t happen. But hey. I was going to have sex with my husband anyway. so I kept a glimmer of hope alive.I know my pregnant-at-age-46 story has a happy ending. and that it doesn t have the same ending for everyone. I have heard about all the miscarriages. the wasted time and money of unsuccessful IVF. the agony and heartbreak of the people who never get to see that blue line. and worse. I don t know why it worked out for me and not for others. My heart is with those who will read my story and feel anger. jealousy. fear and pain. And when I was searching for encouragement and answers. I found so much doom and gloom: people who chided me for my pregnancy plans. societal judgment. articles that shamed mothers who waited until later in life to start their families. and I was reminded at every click of the less-than-optimistic birth statistics we older moms face. But for those of us who are unable to afford medical interventions to get pregnant or who are reluctant to go through those processes. rest assured that pregnancy can and does happen to us people at the top of the  You re too old to get naturally pregnant  charts.There are downsides to being an older mom. When I m 50. my daughter will be 4. Some of my friends will be seeing their kids getting married while I m still changing diapers. I may never get to meet my kids  grandchildren or even see my children graduate college. depending on what s in store for me.The future is uncertain. But that is the case for mothers of any age.And despite the hard parts. when my family is together. laughing and smiling. I can genuinely say it was all worth it.

Many of us think of diet soda as a way to have our soda and drink it. too. You get the experience of drinking soda. but not the calories and sugar that come with it. And while health experts aren t exactly gung-ho about diet soda. researchers are still working to understand exactly what it does to the human body. First things first: Drinking one to two cans of diet soda per day likely won t hurt you— and contrary to popular belief. there isn t credible evidence that diet soda causes cancer.although a possible connection is still being studied continuously. But it can be helpful to know just how diet soda could be affecting your body in some not-so-great ways. especially if you re a regular consumer of it. Here s everything you need to know. If you think diet soda can help you lose weight. you may want to think twice about that theory. Even though diet soda doesn t contain sugar or calories. it can actually make you crave sugar. According to a 2021 study. beverages that are made with sucralose — a no-calorie sweetener used in many diet sodas — may stimulate appetite in some people. Another study found that the artificial sweeteners aspartame and saccharin are linked with an increase in appetite and an increased risk of obesity.Additionally. an older studyfrom 2010 found that aspartame and sucralose could increase sugar cravings. There s some research to suggest that diet soda could be detrimental to your heart health.  Diet sodas are often loaded with artificial sweeteners. which can have harmful effects on blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. In addition. diet sodas tend to be acidic. which can promote inflammation and contribute to heart disease.  explained Dr. Alice Williams. studyIf you re working to keep your gut health on track. you may want to be wary of diet soda. Nutritive sweeteners found in diet drinks. like polyols. could negatively impact your gut health. according to ​​Divya Nair. the head of microbiology at probiotics company Sun Genomics. One study looked at the effect of polyols on both healthy and IBS patients.  Nair said.  Gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in both healthy individuals and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients including symptoms such as bloating. abdominal discomfort. and laxative effects when consumed in healthy volunteers and patients with IBS.  If you re headache-prone. you may want to examine your diet soda habit.  Diet soda [often] contains caffeine. and caffeine can causes headaches in some people as it constricts blood vessels.  Williams said.  Additionally. caffeine is a diuretic. which can lead to dehydration. another possible cause of headaches. If you re one of those people who gets headaches without caffeine. there is also some evidence that artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose are correlated with headaches. When diet sodas are consumed on a regular basis. they can have a detrimental impact on short- and long-term brain health. according to Dr. Annie Fenn. a physician. culinary instructor and founder of Brain Health Kitchen. In one of the most compelling studies to date. published in the journal Stroke. Boston University researchers analyzed the drinking habits of over 4000 healthy participants between 1998 and 2011.  she said.  After correcting the findings for confounding factors like age. sex. education. caloric intake. diet quality. physical activity. and smoking. the diet soda-drinking men and women ended up getting Alzheimer s disease 2.89 more times and stroke 2.96 more times when compared to those who did not drink diet sodas. And the results show that the risks went up with each serving of diet soda consumed. she added.One small study published in August found that the artificial sweeteners sucralose and saccharin can interfere with the body s insulin response.  When an impaired insulin response plays out multiple times a day over years. it can lead to insulin resistance—meaning target organs (like your brain) no longer respond to insulin.  Fenn said.  The result? Glucose roams freely in the bloodstream. creating inflammatory particles that seep across the blood-brain barrier and damage the tiny blood vessels there. Diet sodas may be correlated with decreased bone density. due to the fact that diet sodas contain high levels of phosphates. which can leach calcium from bones. according to Williams.  As a result. regular consumption of diet soda may increase the risk of osteoporosis.  she said.Additionally. one study found that intake of both regular cola and diet cola ― but not other carbonated beverages ― is associated with a lower bone mass density in women.While this information may not be the best news for the diet soda drinkers among us. keep in mind that what diet soda actually does to the body is still being studied. But if you want to err on the side of caution. it s probably best to keep your diet soda consumption on the moderate side.,Health News
Moments before the session was due to start. I dug through a haphazard stack of pens and rubber bands and notecards in an unfamiliar desk drawer. searching for something sharp.It s OK. I m going to fix it.I craved what I knew would lower the frustration s intensity ― the sensation of mild pain on the skin of my forearm. When I couldn t find anything in the drawer. and was forced to open Zoom and begin the session. I chewed an ulcer into the side of my cheek instead. I was not a teenager. I was in my mid-30s and working as a clinician in an outpatient mental health center. About six months earlier. I first experienced the power of piercing one s skin to relieve overwhelming negative emotion. Under the stress of a project deadline and following a meeting in which everyone seemed burnt out and irritable. I instinctively gripped my left forearm. wrist and hand in my right hand. Hard. In a matter of seconds. all my rage and hurt and indignation evaporated. and I took note. My self-harm escalated over the course of a few months. With each incident. I became less shocked at what I had done to myself. and therefore willing to use tools increasingly likely to cause injury and scarring.non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)Most people who engage in NSSIIn the moment. I was so overwhelmed that if I didn t do it. the emotion ― usually some combination of anger. grief. anxiety. guilt and vindictiveness ― would consume me and strip away my ability to function. Really?You re starting this now? You ve been in the workforce for over a decade. You have two master s degrees. in public health and clinical social work! If anyone should know better. it s you.Guess what the result of self-shaming is? Intense emotion. And intense emotion leads. in the absence of other methods of coping. to more cutting. I did confess my feelings and actions to both my own therapist and clinical supervisor. who responded perfectly ― without shock or condemnation.  You were trying to cope.  my therapist stated simply. after I described becoming overwhelmed with regret ― again ― that my 15-year-old plans for an academic medical career didn t pan out. Eyes lowered in shame. I admitted to her that I had relieved this distress by cutting myself. She directed me to identify other coping strategies that I could use instead. but only after acknowledging that the feelings leading to the behavior were understandable.Of course And the gold standard treatment for NSSII was familiar with DBT and occasionally suggested a DBT skills worksheet to a client. but I had not yet internalized its skills to the point that I used them in my own life. Knowledge and skill building are distinct. The skills take practice. and the person practicing will slip up. We are not born knowing how to regulate our emotions. and unfortunately many of us are not taught as children or adolescents. Why did I start in my 30s? I d been battling anxiety since childhood and depression for most of my adult life. and yet I d never deliberately pierced my skin before. This wasn t the first time I d encountered work-related stress. and I hadn t had any recent major life changes. such as marriage. divorce. moving or serious diagnoses. between 4% and 23% of adults engage in NSSIEvidence suggestsWhy did I  catch  cutting when other therapists who work with people who self-harm don t start doing it themselves? I have always had problems with emotion regulation. I realized. and I never recognized it. In the past. I have coped by punching steering wheels. desks and chairs. and by slamming doors. I was already primed to turn to cutting when my emotions felt overwhelming.A few days after I searched that desk drawer at the office. I decided that I would no longer self-harm in any way. including chewing on my cheek and picking at my skin when anxious. I had learned the alternative coping skills. The only piece missing was my commitment to practicing them. I grabbed some scrap paper and jotted down a list of strategies. promising myself that I would go through the entire list before cutting myself. or punching myself or a hard object in anger. or chewing my cheeks to shreds. I wrote at the bottom of the page that any form of self-harm was unacceptable. Then I took a photo and saved it to the  favorites  photo album on my phone for easy access.The word  unacceptable  stuck in my mind from a DBT-based book that I had read in an attempt to help a client who was cutting. The book validated the desire to self-harm to cope with strong emotions yet also labeled the behavior as  unacceptable.  Another reader may have felt shamed. but I felt motivated to commit to changing my response to strong emotion. When we label the behavior as unacceptable. we still acknowledge that it is our present reality. In order to tell myself that self-harm was unacceptable. I had to make other actions acceptable. I had to give myself permission to cancel my clients  sessions at the last minute if I was not mentally able to practice at my best. I had to remind myself that my therapist and supervisor are not inconvenienced or angry at me if I need to reach out to them between scheduled meetings. I had to weigh the real ― and debatable ― risks and benefits of using a fast-acting anti-anxiety medication rather than cut myself. Next. I had to train myself to identify my emotions and name them to myself. Often the simple act of putting a word to my internal experience lessened the emotion without any further intervention. Yet this step proved surprisingly difficult. The feeling of overwhelming emotion was very familiar to me. but it didn t always have a name. Often in the time it took me to puzzle over whether I felt indignation. sadness. worry. anger. or all four. the emotional intensity decreased. The naming emotion strategy is backed by neuroscience. When we ask ourselves to name our emotion. we turn on the prefrontal cortex. the region in the brain where high-level thinking and reasoning occur. With the thinking brain online. the amygdala ― the part of the brain that processes strong emotion ― backs off. The first few times I encountered overwhelming stress after making my commitment. I struggled to convince myself that trying my list of skills was worth it. when I knew that cutting would calm me down reliably and quickly. One day. a communication breakdown with the veterinarian s office meant that I couldn t get my sick cat s prescription medication before it closed for the weekend. After hanging up with the vet s administrative assistant. I found myself with my whole body shaking and the urge to cut.  Stop.  I told myself.  You promised you wouldn t do this anymore.  Name the emotion: Anger — at both the vet s office and myself. Concern for my cat.Count the seconds of each breath: One. two. three. four ... in. One. two. three. four ... out.Chew gum. Mark wrist with a pen where I want to cut. Text a friend to report what happened with the cat s prescription and receive support.Remind self that nothing lasts forever. including overwhelming emotion.After going through the steps. I was still angry and concerned. Yet the intensity had lessened. and I could think clearly without hurting myself. Best of all. the success reinforced that the skills work. with practice. Brandy E.

I want towantBut eventually. two babies and the freight train that is menopause hit. Truthfully. it is only in retrospect that menopause feels like tons of twisted metal has knocked me over. In reality. the metamorphosis from  40 and Still Feeling Cute  to  50 and Way Past My Prime  was slow. insidious and confusing. One reason for the mystery of  Am I menopausal or am I not?  was an endometrial ablation I had a decade ago ― a procedure that destroyed my uterine lining to prevent suffering through monthly menstrual bloodbaths. The results were miraculous. but prevented me from knowing exactly when I was going through the great comedown.harrowingI was not ready to accept this punch to my marriage or my identity. so I decided to ask my gynecologist for a referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist. I m not sure where I learned of this option or what exactly such a PT could do to help. but with the referral in hand I ... did nothing. Each year I went to see my OB-GYN and asked her to re-up the referral. But I continued to slow-walk my way to nowhere. Meanwhile. my libido was atrophying and sex hurt more than ever.Finally. I made the appointment and was assigned a physical therapist. Kaeli Gockel. who seemed to be in the prime of her own reproductive years but somehow possessed an old-soul compassion for middle-aged women scrabbling with where we now fit into society. expectsAnother goal was to keep my vaginal walls supple by stretching them. which was surprisingly necessary even after birthing two nearly-10-pound babies in the Aughts. I was instructed to order pricey silicone dilators in varying sizes. and Kaeli taught me how to use them ― inserting and pressing in a semi-circle as if I was moving from the 3 o clock to 9 o clock positions. We discussed urinary incontinence and flatulence as matter-of-factly as if we were discussing traffic or how we take our coffee ... or farting while sitting in traffic drinking coffee.Early on. we looped my gynecologist back into the process of revamping my nether region. She agreed to prescribe estrogen cream. which I have to messily insert two to three times a week with the goal of moistening tissues and making them  bouncier. Great Wall of VaginaAs the climax to this process. Kaeli invited my husband to come to an appointment. An excellent sport. he accepted the invitation. For the first time since I started seeing her. I was nervous. Would we have to do this with the lights fully on? Would he be disgusted? Would he still want to attempt sex with me after this? With Kaeli s patient coaching. though. he learned how to help me with the dilators. and the session went well. My husband even seemed grateful that we d included him. After all of my work. Kaeli suggested I buy a sex toy for myself. as a treat. I d only ever been gifted sex toys before. and those were based on what my boyfriend at the time or husband thought I d want. so I splurged on a clitoral vibrator. Let s just say that it makes me forget my aging body. bright lights. or even what planet I m on.Nothing about this pelvic floor physical therapy has been inexpensive or easy. And I m still not 100% pain free when having sex. but I feel like I m getting there. Still. I recognize how fortunate I am to have the time. money and insurance to address these issues. This shouldn t be a privilege afforded to a select few ― everyone should have access to whatever they need to create a healthy. happy sex life.I recently found an Instagram post by Dr. Sara Reardon. a pelvic floor physical therapist. that eases my guilt surrounding the currency of both health insurance deductibles and time I ve spent rehabbing my sex life. In the post. she responded to a physician noting that pelvic floor physical therapy is currently trendy.  Pelvic Floor PT is not a trend. It s an integral part of healthcare that has been overlooked and underutilized for too long.  Reardon s post says. And Kaeli. my PT. says.  My dream is that someday everyone will have easy shame-free access to pelvic health and sexual wellness. I really believe we can t have true equality until we have orgasm equality and we can t achieve that until painful intercourse is taken seriously by insurance companies. It took me 19 years after the birth of my first child to finally visit a pelvic floor physical therapist and whatever bumps (plus hopefully bangs and slams) I encounter on the road to good post-menopausal sex. I am. at the very least. doing my best to keep it all going.Angie McCullagh is a Seattle writer with work in The Independent. The Sun Magazine. Wired. Writer s Digest. and various other outlets.

It s well known that certain habits. like smoking or drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. can damage your heart over time. But many of the everyday habits that we don t really think about — how frequently we brush our teeth. the supplements we take and the amount of coffee we drink — can also take a toll on the health of our hearts. What we do. eat and drink can significantly influence our blood pressure. cholesterol and heart rate. and ultimately influence our overall heart function. Here are a few everyday habits that can contribute to heart problems:Daniel Edmundowicz. the chief of cardiology at Temple University Hospital. said that people often think they are eating a healthy. balanced diet but. in actuality. are setting themselves up for heart problems down the road. For example. he s seen people adhering to a low cholesterol diet avoid healthy fats. an important macronutrient. Then. they may eat too many carbohydrates. While this type of diet wouldn t cause an increase in cholesterol levels. it can lead to weight gain and put a lot of stress on the sugar system and diabetes system. according to Edmundowicz. Crash dieting can similarly tax the cardiovascular system. and research has shown that a sudden and extreme shift in eating habits can lead to a deterioration in heart function.  Going from one extreme to another really doesn t help.  Edmundowicz said. Being isolated from others can also have a profound impact on our heart health. according to Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar. a board-certified cardiologist at Providence Saint John s Health Center in Santa Monica. California.A recent study found that older women have a 8% higher risk of cardiovascular disease when living in social isolation and a 5% higher risk for cardiovascular disease when they re living with loneliness. For people experiencing both social isolation and loneliness. the risk for heart disease grows to 27%. Social isolation can also contribute to depression. and depression can lead to cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension. sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits. according to Edmundowicz.  Social isolation is a biggie. and it does contribute to poor heart health.  Edmundowicz said. Dental issues — like gum and tooth decay — can increase the risk of bacterial infections in the bloodstream. According to Tadwalkar. it s very easy for bacteria in the mouth to travel to the blood. Recent research also found that regularly having your teeth cleaned is linked to better heart health outcomes. Edmundowicz said it s known that gingivitis and poor oral health causes an inflammatory state that could exasperate heart problems like high cholesterol or plaque rupture. Good oral hygiene is important. We can t say 100% that brushing and flossing every day is going to prevent a heart attack. but it can increase one s vulnerability if they have the other standard risk factors.  Edmundowicz said. Some medications have been found to trigger cardiovascular issues. ADHD medications. for example. can ramp up the nervous system and cause increased heart rate and blood pressure. Drugs with a diuretic effect. such as the anti-hormonal medication Spironolactone. can decrease blood pressure. and in people with naturally low blood pressure. lead to symptoms like lightheadedness and dizziness.Tadwalkar stressed that this doesn t mean that everyone needs to be concerned about their medications. However. those who are predisposed to blood pressure or heart rhythm issues may need to be careful with the dosing of their medications. Your physician should take your heart health history into consideration while figuring out the right dosage for you.Supplements can also impact the heart. especially among people taking vitamins and herbal supplements they don t actually need. Supplements can interact with prescribed medications and also have destructive effects on the heart. according to Tadwalkar. He recommends talking to a physician about supplements to determine if they may have cardiovascular effects. Caffeinated coffee is generally safe and protective for the heart. Research suggests that drinking two cups of coffee per day provides the greatest cardiovascular benefits. But too much coffee can have a negative effect because it  can speed up the heart. cause increased heart rate. cause contraction of the blood vessels and increased blood pressure. and certainly if you re prone to rhythm disturbances of the heart. the caffeine at high doses can cause that.  Tadwalkar said. Caffeine is considered safe until 300 to 400 milligrams. and after that. it can have a cascade of negative effects.Research has also shown that filtered coffee is associated with better cholesterol levels than unfiltered coffee. such a French press.  Oftentimes we don t link cholesterol with coffee. but filtered coffee has less bad cholesterol content than less filtered coffee.  Tadwalkar said. In general. the blacker the coffee. the healthier it is for the body. When the body s fight-or-flight system is chronically activated. it can cause inflammation in the body and prolonged release of stress hormones like adrenaline. These factors together can cause physiological changes in the body. including increases in blood pressure. high cholesterol. obesity. insulin resistance and electrical rhythm disturbances. according to Tadwalkar.Chronic stress can also increase the risk of blood clotting throughout the body. If a clot forms in an artery that s already narrow. it can cause a heart attack.  This is why people who have a lot of chronic stress. you may see. oftentimes. will end up with a heart attack.  Tadwalkar said. Triggers of stress are all around us. and it can be hard to escape. Because those triggers aren t going away. it s crucial to learn how to effectively manage your stress. said Tadwalkar. who recommends stress-relieving activities like meditation. yoga. exercise and enjoyable hobbies. Most people need about seven to eight hours of sleep a night — too much or too little sleep can contribute to cardiovascular issues. including heart attack and stroke. It s not just about the quantity of sleep. but the quality. too. High-quality. regenerative sleep is crucial to maintaining a healthy heart. Lower-quality sleep is linked to high blood pressure. elevated cholesterol and atherosclerosis (a build up of plaque in the arteries).  We want people to sleep well. and for the expected duration of time. to really protect their heart.  Tadwalkar said. ,Health News
Losing a loved one to suicide is a particularly painful and complex grieving experience.Suicide Awareness Voices of EducationLoved ones are often left grappling with impossible questions. feelings of regret and blame. and a sense of isolation. Unfortunately. the people around them may say things that reinforce negative beliefs and emotions as well.  Language can perpetuate confusion. misinterpretation. lack of understanding and the fear around the issue of suicide.  Reidenberg said.  Understand that the person who lost someone to suicide is likely to be having a very difficult time making sense of the world. their loss and even how to accept supportive comments from others. Thus it is helpful to be aware of the common reactions someone might have after losing someone to suicide and how you can best be there for them with words that help. support and show you care. Of course. there s no perfect thing to say in this heartbreaking situation ― and most attempts at comfort are incredibly well-intentioned. That said. there are some pitfalls to avoid.Kim TorgusonBelow. experts share the words that are not helpful and their advice for how to approach a grieving loved one. We sometimes act impulsively when responding to someone who lost a loved one by saying that we know how they feel or that things will get better in time.  said Nance Roy. chief clinical officer at the mental health organization The Jed Foundation.  But unless one has lost someone to suicide themselves. they will not really know how it feels or when and how time may help. Avoid giving generalized advice like  time heals everything  or predicting the course their grief journey will take. Remember that everyone s situation and response is complex and different.they Make sure that you are expressing yourself with compassion [and] care and convey that while you might not know exactly how they feel. you do care and you do want to be there for them.  Reidenberg said.  Being there means being available when they need to talk and being willing to listen. empathetically. Often it is less about what you do say and more that you are willing to listen to their pain.  It is important not to make statements such as ‘they are in a better place now  or ‘they are finally out of their pain.   Reidenberg said. A  better place  comment is particularly unhelpful if your friend has different spiritual beliefs. so keep that personal religious outlook to yourself. Sankofa Marriage and Family Therapy It s important to avoid framing someone s death by suicide as ‘selfish  or ‘cowardly.   Torguson said.  People who die by suicide are in extreme pain. feel like they are a burden to others. and often see no alternate way to move forward. Describing the person who died as selfish or cowardly is judgmental and ignores the reality there s a severe psychological and physical condition they re experiencing. While a loved one grieving the suicide might express these sentiments. it s not your place to say that to them. Rather than passing judgment on the way their life ended. try to focus on the person who was lost. Doreen Marshall It s important to try to avoid oversimplifying suicide by trying to attribute someone s death by suicide to a single cause or circumstance ― such as a relationship ending. job loss or bullying.  Torguson said. Those who ve lost a loved one to suicide may try to make sense of why it happened and struggle with many unanswered questions. Your guesses about a specific reason for their suicide are not helpful and show ignorance of the complexity of the issue.  I would avoid anything that indicates that this was a death that had a single cause.  Marshall echoed.  Suicide occurs due to complex biological. psychological and environmental factors that converge in an individual in a moment where they believe there is no other option to end the pain they are in.  It is imperative not to imply that the person who lost someone to suicide might have been able to intervene.  Roy emphasized. Many people already wrestle with feelings of self-blame even without these kinds of questions and comments from others. Suicide is a complex. multi-faceted public health issue that often leaves a wave of complicated grief for those left behind — family members. friends. colleagues. neighbors. etc.  Torguson said.  Survivors of suicide loss are often left grappling with questions such as ‘why?  ‘what could I have done?  or ‘how did I miss the warning signs?  Ruminating over all the weeks. months and years leading up to the loss doesn t lead to healing. so don t encourage this.  You should definitely not blame anyone for the loss. including the person who has passed away.  Henry said.  It won t be helpful to go over all the things that could have or should have happened differently. Similarly. Reidenberg advised against saying.  You tried everything that you could to save them.   You definitely do not want to imply or give the perception that the person who has died did so to make someone angry or to get back at them in revenge.  he explained. Instead. try to remove any notion of blame from the equation. Provide a safe space for them to share their emotions and offer whatever support you can. It is helpful to remind them that they are not alone and important to convey that they are not to blame nor responsible for their loved one s death.  Roy said.  While we want to talk openly and honestly about suicide and suicide prevention. it s important to keep in mind that the words we use can either promote hope and help-seeking or further stigmatize those who may be struggling or cause those who have lost someone to suicide to feel judged or ostracized.  Torguson said. experts warnDr. Jacek DebiecReidenberg echoed that sentiment. noting that  commit  tends to be associated with a crime or a sin. We don t say someone  committed  heart disease or cancer. Instead. the phrase  died by suicide  is preferred. Reidenberg also advised against using the word  successful.  ‘Successful  implies the person was successful. they achieved or accomplished something.  he noted.  It is best to not say ‘they were crazy  or ‘they must have been out of their mind to do that.   Reidenberg said. Again. avoid disparaging the person who has died. as this adds to the stigma around mental health struggles ― and also creates an uncomfortable environment for discussing the complicated emotions around grief. We should be mindful that any language that conveys judgment about the person who died or the suicide itself is likely to leave the griever feeling more alone with their grief and less likely that you will be a person they turn to as they try to understand what has happened and why.  Marshall said. Remember. your grieving loved one is suffering immense pain that will come and go in waves. Speak to them from a place of honesty and sincerity ― and know you don t have to have all the answers. There s no one right thing to say in this situation.  If we do not know what to say. but we feel that we should say or do something. a tender gesture of care may be better. such as sending flowers or a card.  Debiec said.  Admitting. ‘I don t know what to say. but I am here for you and will be here for you if you need me.  is better than reciting a prepared script. Our empathy will find its way to the person in grief. Continue showing up and reaching out. In addition to asking if there s any way you can help. suggest specific things you can do. They may not be in a mindset to know how you can help exactly. so offering to help with concrete tasks like getting groceries. helping with child care. etc.. can be very helpful.  Roy said. Help them find professional support like individual or group therapy if they express interest. And. ultimately. the most important thing is just to be there. Social connection is a key protective factor against suicide. so if you know someone who has lost a loved one to suicide. keep showing up. reaching out. and being there for them.  Torguson said.  Letting them know that you care and are available to listen non-judgmentally can be exactly what they need in their time of grief.  If you or someone you know needs help. dial 988 or call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also get support via text by visiting suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.

American Medical Associationstatement Physicians. pharmacists. and other health care professionals face a confusing legal landscape due to state laws  lack of clarity. confusing language. and unknown implementation by regulatory and enforcement bodies.  the statement reads.  Without such guidance. we are deeply concerned that our patients will lose access to care and suffer irreparable harm. The groups pointed to reports that some hospitals had prioritized caution over healthcare. others that have removed emergency contraceptives from kits for victims of sexual assault and pharmacies that have imposed  burdensome  steps for prescriptions.Republicans17 million women These bans mean that every one of these millions of people. should they need an abortion. will have to overcome extreme logistical and financial barriers to access care.

sentencedWhen covering the story. many media outlets dubbed O Leary  vegan mom.  Investigators said that O Leary told them her family ate only raw fruits and vegetables. and that Ezra was given breast milk as well. His siblings. ages 3 and 5. were also reported to have been malnourished. Vegans and their supporters say that it s unfortunate that O Leary s case — in addition to a few others that have made headlines over the years — is the only example of vegan parenting that many people have heard of.Deborah Malkoff-CohenDr. Yami Cazorla-Lancaster I am very careful to counsel parents that raw vegan diets are not appropriate for children because it is simply too difficult for them to acquire sufficient calories for growth from raw fruits and vegetables.  explained Cazorla-Lancaster. adding that a child who is not gaining sufficient weight would be diagnosed with failure to thrive and treated by their doctor. Malkoff-Cohen said that cases like the O Leary s  give vegan diets a bad name.  She notes that she has seen adults with inflammation. heart disease and insulin resistance all improve their health by going vegan. and believes that such diets can work for some people.American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics I have had the privilege of witnessing many healthy. thriving vegan children grow up. and I have no doubt that children can be safely and healthfully raised on an exclusively plant-based diet.  said Cazorla-Lancaster. Like using cloth diapers or commuting by bicycle. veganism is an eco-conscious lifestyle choice that isn t mainstream. but feels right to some parents.I have followed a vegan diet as a way to extend compassion to animals.  said Karla Moreno-Bryce. a registered dietician in Minnesota.  Both my kids have been following a vegan diet since conception. and it is very rewarding to be able to share this lifestyle with them. If you re considering veganism for your family. here are a few things to keep in mind.Malkoff-Cohen shared a meal plan she had written for a couple who wanted to raise their toddler vegan. It featured items like a chickpea-potato-broccoli patty and red lentil  meatballs  that sound delicious. but are also a lot of work for the food-preparing parent.  You have to cook a lot more things.  she said.  You have to be more creative.  Malkoff-Cohen shared a couple of tricks: A serving of cooked spinach can be added into a smoothie for a dose of calcium. You can sprinkle fortified nutritional yeast on pasta and popcorn for a good source of B vitamins. guidesNourishThe Plant-Based Baby and ToddlerWith the proper knowledge about the key nutrients for kids who follow a vegan diet . . . and how to meet them through plant based foods. parents can feel reassured they re supporting the growth and development of their kids. and feel proud of following a vegan lifestyle.  said Moreno-Bryce. calories. fat. iron. zinc. iodine. calcium. vitamin B12 and vitamin D  as the ones to keep track of when feeding a vegan diet to your kids. and explained that  a variety of plant-based foods from grains. legumes. fruits. vegetables. nuts and seeds throughout the day and week  will cover almost all of these bases. Malkoff-Cohen s meal plan included sources of protein and fat at every meal. as well as daily servings of iron and calcium. Breakfast might be a smoothie with nondairy milk. frozen banana and almond butter. and lunch could consist of a sweet potato black bean burger with avocado and fries. Moreno-Bryce said that she uses routines. family meals and intuitive eating with her own children to  ensure that I m best supporting their growth and development while following a vegan diet.  Cazorla-Lancaster said she recommends that all of her patients take a vitamin D supplement. and that those on plant-based diets add a B12 supplement as well. B12 is a nutrient that naturally lacks in plant foods. and a supplement. in addition to fortified foods that include Vitamin B12. is the most reliable source.  said Moreno-Bryce.A kid with a nut allergy will have to work hard to find other sources of protein and fat. A child with a sensitive stomach might experience digestive discomfort on a high-fiber vegan diet. A teen athlete may need to consume a great quantity of protein and calories.Any of those children. though. might also be committed to an animal-free diet. and willing to try new kinds of fortified milks or other foods until they find the combination that agrees with both their body and their values. In the case of the vegan toddler that Malkoff-Cohen helped meal plan for. she became more selective with what she would eat and wasn t gaining weight. so her parents decided to add eggs and some dairy products into her diet.  Maybe when she s 10 or eight. she ll realize she wants to eat what her parents eat. But I think they did a good thing for her.  said Malkoff-Cohen. who said that the child did grow on her adjusted diet.  Plant-based diets are rich in antioxidants. vitamins. minerals and fiber that are beneficial for health and are often low in the standard American diet.  said Cazorla-Lancaster.  However. if a child is not getting enough calories. they will struggle to gain weight and grow appropriately.  As any parent of a toddler can tell you. small children may simply refuse the foods that you offer. and it s developmentally appropriate for older children to question pretty much everything. Kids who understand the reasons for a vegan diet as part of a bigger picture will be more motivated to stick with it.  It s appropriate for parents to discuss with their children why they choose to eat a certain way inside their homes. but it is also important for parents to be aware that as a child grows and is exposed more and more to other ways of eating. they may become curious and have questions.  said Cazorla-Lancaster. Eventually. children will need to make their own choices when it comes to situations like snack breaks and party foods. Knowing the animal rights or environmental beliefs behind your veganism will go a lot further than vilifying meat and dairy and the people who eat it. I have followed a vegan diet as a way to extend compassion to animals. and that is the primary reason for raising my kids on a vegan diet as well.  said Moreno-Bryce. Cazorla-Lancaster warned against  telling children that they shouldn t eat a hamburger because they are ‘going to get fat  or because ‘it causes heart attacks.   These kinds of statements  can lead to food and body shame and disordered eating behaviors.  she said.Malkoff-Cohen noted that potato chips and Oreos are vegan. but you wouldn t want your kids eating them frequently. You ll still want to limit processed foods and emphasize fruits and vegetables. There are many new plant-based products on the market touting health benefits. but it s important to read the nutrition labels carefully. A popular egg-substitute that she recommends for her egg allergy clients. for example. has protein. but lacks the other nutrients eggs offer. A plant milk might not have vitamin D added. or may have too much added sugar. Prepared vegan foods are now more widely available in supermarket freezer aisles. but don t assume that plant-based automatically means nutrient-rich. These foods can pack a lot of sodium and preservatives. and may not have as much of a variety of plants in them as you would hope. Simply eating around animal products isn t usually a good solution. either. Referring to her son s weekly breakfast menu from school. Malkoff-Cohen noted that. for a child eating only vegan items. a whole wheat bagel with cream cheese and jelly would become just a bagel with jelly. and lose most of its nutritional value. On other days. the only option would be fruit. which wouldn t sustain a child until lunch. A vegan parent would need to send their child to school every day with vegan alternatives to breakfast. lunch and snack.Maybe you re not ready to eliminate animal products entirely. but you do want to make changes to your family s diet to impact your health or reflect your values.  It really doesn t have to be all-or-nothing when it comes to health benefits.  said Cazorla-Lancaster. You may not want to train for a marathon. but that doesn t mean it s pointless to take a daily walk. Incorporating more plants is going to benefit everyone in the family.  Cazorla-Lancaster explained. Perhaps you switch to a nondairy milk. or identify a day of the week to have a vegan family dinner. Trying new foods and cooking together are other ways you can slowly broaden your kids  palate and encourage them to find the kind of diet that feels right for them as they start to make their own food decisions.Moreno-Bryce said that by  talking about why we choose to follow such [a] lifestyle.  she hopes that her 4-year-old and 2-month-old  learn about kindness and grow up to be compassionate human beings. ,Health News

The first group followed a 12-week high-intensity interval training program. the second group followed a 12-week moderate-to-vigorous intensity training program. the third group followed a 12-week Nordic walking program.After the workout program. participants were observed for 14 weeks. and their functional capacity ― or their ability to exercise or perform daily activities that require physical effort ― was tested by measuring how far they walked in six minutes.Additionally. the researchers had participants fill out a heart disease-specific questionnaire and a 36-question health survey. Depression levels were also measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. which is commonly used to measure depression after heart attacks. Participants were tested at the beginning. the middle and the end of the study.While all participants saw favorable health outcomes. those in the Nordic walking group experienced the largest increase in functional capacity compared to their baseline level at the start of the study.In other words. those who committed to the 12-week Nordic walking program were most able to show increased exercise capacity during the six-minute walk test.

A federal judge in Texas ruled Wednesday that requiring employers to provide coverage for PrEP medications ― which prevent the transmission of HIV ― violates the religious rights of employers under federal law.U.S. District Judge Reed O Connor said that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides a religious exemption from purchasing health insurance that complies with the Department of Health and Human Services  preventive care mandate under the Affordable Care Act. which requires PrEP coverage.O Connor said the government must provide this religious exemption to eight defendants ― six individuals and two businesses ― who claim that being required to provide such insurance coverage violates their  sincerely held  Christian and  non-religious  beliefs rejecting  homosexual behavior. intravenous drug use. and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman. By requiring them to provide insurance that covers PrEP. as well as the HPV vaccine and sex education. the government  would make [them] complicit in those behaviors.  O Connor concluded.Here s a copy of O Connor s 42-page decision in the lawsuit. Kelley v. Becerra.The Texas judge went on to say that courts must support religious exemptions from federal policy mandates if a person s religious belief is  sincerely held.  citing Supreme Court precedents in its 2014 Hobby Lobby decision and its 2020 decision in Little Sisters of the Poor. Both of those decisions authorized religious exemptions to contraception mandates in the Affordable Care Act.For this reason. O Connor determined. the government may not question whether it is factually correct that paying for coverage that includes PrEP subsidizes  homosexual conduct. The government  may not ‘tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed  because the connection between the morally objectionable conduct and complicity in the conduct ‘is simply too attenuated.   he wrote. citing the Hobby Lobby decision.Beyond that. O Connor declared the Preventive Services Task Force ― the government body that recommended the preventive care mandate rules for PrEP coverage ― an illegally appointed body in violation of the Appointments Clause.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) denounced O Connor s decision. saying it puts people s lives at risk. Today. a radical. Republican-appointed federal judge ruled that employers can deny coverage for PrEP: a drug proven to save lives from HIV/AIDS and a key strategy for ending the epidemic.  Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday. This disturbing decision amounts to open homophobia: unleashing unthinkable suffering and death specifically among the LGBTQ community.  she said.  This decision also threatens vital preventative health services guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. including birth control. vaccinations and routine health screenings. Dr. Marwan Haddad. chair of the HIV Medicine Association. which represents medical professionals who practice HIV medicine. said his organization is  deeply disturbed  by O Connor s ruling. This ruling is yet one more instance of unacceptable interference in scientific. evidence-based health care practices that must remain within the sanctity of the provider-patient relationship.  Haddad said in a statement.  Religious refusal laws allowing the personal beliefs of employers or health care providers to dictate access to prevention. care and treatment services are discriminatory and dangerous. O Connor. an appointee of former President George W. Bush. is known as a favorite among conservative lawyers because he tends to rule against Democratic policies. Attorneys general in Texas appear to strategically file key lawsuits in his jurisdiction so he ll hear them.A number of his rulings have been reversed on appeal.In 2018. O Connor ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. a decision that one legal expert described at the time as  insanity in print.  His decision was reversed on appeal in 2020. and the Supreme Court upheld the law a year later.In 2015. O Connor barred the Department of Labor from immediately enforcing a new rule granting Family and Medical Leave Act benefits to same-sex couples. He argued that the public had  an abiding interest  in protecting state laws from  federal encroachment.  But he soon dissolved his injunction after the Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. which cemented the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples.O Connor s other decisions of note include his 2015 ruling that part of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 was unconstitutional (this was reversed on appeal). his 2018 ruling that the Indian Child Welfare Act was unconstitutional (the Supreme Court is revisiting this law in November). and his 2021 ruling that the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act offer an exemption to employers from the Civil Rights Act s ban on sex discrimination.Earlier this year. O Connor temporarily blocked the Pentagon from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for Navy SEALs. claiming the federal government has  no license  to infringe on the freedoms of SEALs. His preliminary injunction was partially upheld by the Supreme Court in March.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the date of O Connor s ruling.,Health News
We ve all got our favorite American adaptations of Chinese cuisine. even though they re often far removed from the authentic dishes found overseas. Menu items in the U.S.. like General Tso s chicken. chop suey and fortune cookies. are still beloved by many because — no surprise — they taste so darn good. Chinese American food is comforting. consistent. affordable and filling.  said Rebecca Valdez.Still. anyone looking to eat healthfully would be better off following traditional Chinese ways of eating. not American ones. It s a common misconception that Chinese food is heavy and greasy and that the portions are oversized.  said Valdez. who is Taiwanese American.  This may be true for Chinese American takeout. but Chinese people don t eat this way. We eat small amounts of rice from palm-sized bowls. lots of vegetables and a little bit of meat. Most of our food is not deep-fried or even cooked in a lot of oil. Sherene Chou. a Chinese American dietician. said establishments serving these cuisines have a positive impact in the U.S. While they re often demonized for serving so-called unhealthy foods. I see Chinese restaurants as a celebration and an introduction to sharing Chinese flavors and dishes with white American culture.  she said.  Our foods can be a bridge to diving deeper into authentic Chinese regional cuisines. And even though the American version is not always authentic. it can still be enjoyed as a blast from your past. RDN Sherry Lin grew up as a self-described  restaurant kid  in a town 30 minutes outside Chicago. We served all the American Chinese food classics. including chop suey. egg foo young and crab Rangoon. which were things I never saw or ate growing up in Taiwan in my early childhood.  she said.  Now as an adult. I sometimes crave an egg foo young patty for nostalgia. Breana Lai Killeen.a Chinese American registered dietician. said diners should be aware of how Chinese cuisine is meant to be ordered and enjoyed. Food is typically shared.  she said.  That s why I always suggest getting a balance of dishes for the table. This way you can — and should — enjoy the dishes that might be fried or heavier alongside lighter dishes of vegetables and items that are steamed. Vicki Shanta Retelny. an RDN and the host of the podcast  Nourishing Notes.  agreed that healthier choices are always possible at a Chinese restaurant. Many of the dishes are made with vegetables and lean proteins. and you can order them with whole-grain brown rice.  she said.  Since the sauces often are high in salt and sugar. order them on the side and drizzle them on yourself. Choose low-sodium soy sauce. too. RDN Amanda Frankeny had some tips as well.  Regardless of what you choose on the menu. it s always smart to stick with a side of vegetables.  she said.  Or try vegetable bao. a steamed bun with a stack of veg sandwiched in between the pillowy bread. But you need to listen to yourself too. the experts added. Your best choice is whatever you re craving. what s filling and what hits the spot.  Valdez said. If you order your favorite dish. sink your teeth into every bit and don t look back.  Frankeny said.We asked nutritionists to weigh in with their top picks among the most popular dishes found in the U.S.. along with ordering suggestions.Beef with broccoli:  I love the broccoli in this dish.  Retelny said.  I always recommend eating more cruciferous veggies.  Beef is a tasty. nutrient-dense meat that s higher in fat than the lean alternatives like chicken. shrimp or tofu.  Frankeny said.  But it definitely fits into a healthful diet. so mixing it with broccoli and a handful of brown or white rice makes the dish that balanced plate that every dietitian dreams of. Dumplings: RDN Amy Gorin suggested vegetable dumplings as a great option for vegan and vegetarian eaters. Overall. dumpling ingredients are relatively healthy.  Frankeny said.  Each bite is often a mix of protein. fiber. fat. possibly some vegetables and grains. You can also dip them in chili sauce instead of soy. and you ll cut back on sodium. Hot-and-sour soup:  I grew up on hot-and-sour soup. and it s still one of the things I reach for when I want a comforting meal or when I m feeling under the weather.  Gorin said. Broth-based soups like this one go down easy. provide some nutrients. hydration and a feeling of fullness.  Frankeny said.Scallion pancakes:  They re a source of carbohydrates. which are energy-giving.  Frankeny said.  Balance them with a meal packed with vegetables and protein.  These were one of my favorite dishes growing up.  Gorin said.  They re typically paired with a soy dipping sauce. so I like to keep reduced-sodium soy sauce at home and use that when I order takeout. Wonton soup:  This broth-based soup is low in fat and calories. but can be high in sodium.  Retelny warned.  Order a small bowl before the meal and share the wontons with your table. What do professional healthy eaters order for themselves at Chinese restaurants? Their answers may surprise you. It depends on my mood.  Gorin said.  Often. I ll order steamed tofu and broccoli. with the sauce on the side. But I also love anything with rice noodles. and I almost always order a side of steamed or sauteed greens or veggies. I m also a sucker for really good hot-and-sour soup.  I order items that I can t easily make at home.  Valdez said.  So my top picks are egg rolls. because I love the crispy skin and cabbage or pork filling. ho fun. a stir-fried rice noodle dish that s very comforting. and cashew chicken. because I like the sweet-savory combo.  I love ordering vegetarian mapo tofu. because it reminds me of my family.  Chou said.  It s a traditional Sichuan dish. and that s where my grandparents are from. The numbing Sichuan peppercorns and chili oil are what make the dish unique. I can eat it with rice every day.  I love to order steamed chicken and vegetables with brown rice and sauce on the side. or moo shu chicken with plum sauce on the side.  Retelny said.Killeen s order  depends on how many people are at the table.  she said. But she added that her family typically gets pan-fried pork dumplings. spareribs. stir-fried Chinese vegetables like choy sum. mapo tofu. black bean clams. salt-and-pepper shrimp. beef chow fun and Singapore noodles.While many still villainize MSG. which is commonly used in Chinese food. recent years have seen significant pushback against this impulse. Some people report short-term reactions like flushing. sweating and headaches after consuming the flavor enhancer. but researchers question the supposed link to MSG.Valdez pointed to one major reason behind some people s fear:  It s racist.  she said. directing curious readers to a 2021 journal article titled  MSG Is A-OK: Exploring the Xenophobic History of and Best Practices for Consuming Monosodium Glutamate.  The science is pretty clear.  Killeen said.  Research fails to support the link between MSG and the side effects reported as ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome.   The reason why the MSG controversy persists is solely because of xenophobia.  Lin said.  and a society that would rather blame and pinpoint a marginalized group for its problems or ailments. rather than look at updated facts. Chou agreed.  Nutrition information is shared through a Western lens. which often demonizes cultural foods.  she said. MSG is not demonized as an ingredient when used in common ‘American  foods. but when you pair it with Chinese food. it becomes a dirty additive. It s easy to demonize a people and culture when these narratives are associated. When we focus on just the ingredient and take out the racism. it s a flavor enhancer that provides umami that many brands and companies use to build flavor. ,Health News

Tong said in a press release.North CarolinaMost of the limits imposed by Tuesday s settlement won t affect Juul s practices. which halted use of parties. giveaways and other promotions after coming under scrutiny several several years ago.Teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed after Juul s launch in 2015. leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to declare an  epidemic  of underage vaping among teenagers. Health experts said the unprecedented increase risked hooking a generation of young people on nicotine.But since 2019 Juul has mostly been in retreat. dropping all U.S. advertising and pulling its fruit and candy flavors from store shelves.ban all Juul e-cigarettesThe FDA review is part of a sweeping effort by regulators to bring scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping industry after years of regulatory delays. The agency has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes for adult smokers looking for a less harmful alternative.While Juul s early marketing focused on young. urban consumers. the company has since shifted to pitching its product as an alternative nicotine source for older smokers. We remain focused on our future as we fulfill our mission to transition adult smokers away from cigarettes - the number one cause of preventable death - while combating underage use.  the company said in a statement.Juul has agreed to refrain from a host of marketing practices as part of the settlement. They include not using cartoons. paying social media influencers. depicting people under 35. advertising on billboards and public transportation and placing ads in any outlets unless 85% of their audience are adults.The deal also includes restrictions on where Juul products may be placed in stores. age verification on all sales and limits to online and retail sales.Juul initially sold its high-nicotine pods in flavors like mango. mint and creme. The products became a scourge in U.S. high schools. with students vaping in bathrooms and hallways between classes.But recent federal survey data shows that teens have been shifting away from the company. Most teens now prefer disposable e-cigarettes. some of which continue to be sold in sweet. fruity flavors.Overall. the survey showed a drop of nearly 40% in the teen vaping rate as many kids were forced to learn from home during the pandemic. Still. federal officials cautioned about interpreting the results given they were collected online for the first time. instead of in classrooms.___Perrone reported from Washington.

In November 2007. a communication glitch delayed scheduling a doctor s appointment. and I almost exploded. This would be the seventh doctor I d seen in eight months because my muscles had grown so big. They looked buff. but my muscles also tightened and weakened as they grew. My biceps had grown too muscular and weak for me to put on earrings or adjust a turtleneck. When I watered the red impatiens hanging on my front porch. I had to rest between plants.After I finally scheduled the doctor s appointment. I calmed down and wondered at the rage I d felt. I realized I was scared that I would die. that whatever was happening to my body would kill me ― soon. Too soon.I was 52 and had always been strong and healthy. I had a husband. five children and an accounting business. and I wanted to live. But as I searched for a doctor who could give me answers. the stress of running my life as my body weakened turned everything gray. After weeks of hunting and stressing. I realized that whether I had 30 days or 30 years left. I would live those days more fully if I could lay down my fear.No problemNow that I see how fear is damaging whatever time I do have. I ll just stop being afraidExpect good thingsExpect. Good. Things.It turned out to be a good plan. and the process helped me. But dealing with my fear wasn t an easy or occasional exercise. It was more like the time years before when my toddler daughter flung pumpkin puree at the wall. I wiped the pumpkin away. sprayed the remaining orange spot with Fantastik. and scrubbed. Then I stepped back to see a bright white spot on a wall that had collected grime so gradually over the years that no one noticed the slow accumulation. I realized the whole wall of my thought habits needed a good cleaning.By May 2008. my doctors still had not figured out why my muscles were growing. It started with my shoulders. then my biceps and forearms. and then my quads and calves. Then my back was bulking. My lower back muscles tightened in irregular bunches that hurt when I walked for too long. which soon became just a block.I used a CPAP breathing machine to control the sleep apnea that had started when my muscles went amok. The machine needed a higher setting each month. What happens. I asked the neurologist. when it maxes out?He sent me to an otolaryngologist who threaded a tiny camera through my nose and down my throat. He told me the swath of muscles expanding under my chin was tongue muscle. He could cut away some tongue. but the real problem was that the muscles on either side of my spine were closing in my throat. He wouldn t touch those.I kept trying to imagine good things. It didn t give my doctors answers. or loosen my muscles or create more energy. but it did calm me. As I became less reactive and frantic. people connected more fully. I brought a more present energy to my tasks.Mostly. I had more fun. My home responsibilities and my work were in my life because I loved them. I couldn t do more stuff when I put down my fear. but I did enjoy living more. I joked with my clients. I teased one of my daughters. I savored the scent of sauteing onion as I rested between the now-exhausting steps of cooking dinner. acromegalyIn June 2007. near the beginning of my search for what was wrong with me. an MRI had shown no tumor. In May 2008. a second MRI showed a pituitary growth. The surgeon said that lots of people got them ― maybe as much as 15% of the population ― but that they often appeared temporarily and were usually not a problem.The surgeon resisted doing invasive surgery. which would involve going through my nose to the pituitary gland nestled against the brain. The procedure. even when successful. often left patients needing hormone treatment for the rest of their lives. But there was no other pony in the race. so we moved forward with plans to remove the growth.I checked into the hospital. Still uneasy about the surgery. my doctor ordered another MRI. Two hours before surgery the following morning. I sat in a Naugahyde recliner in my hospital room and wondered what awaited me.expect good thingsI called my husband. who was at our favorite local cafe ordering breakfast before my surgery. and asked him to get me a breakfast burrito in case we didn t go through with it. I m really worried about what happens to you if they don t operate.  he said.  I ll be OK.  I said.  Hmmph. Shortly before the procedure was due to begin. my surgeon entered my room. I guess you re wondering about results.  he said.  I waited for my best radiologist to get back from a seminar to have a look. There is no growth. The nurse will bring your discharge papers.  Things like this happen ― more often than you d expect.  the nurse told me.  Sometimes there s a greater power at work. I felt in my bones that I d had no immediate. miraculous healing. My body was the same inert. stubborn self it had become over the previous two years. Still. I wondered. was the nurse right? Was a big life force at work. moving me toward some wonderful conclusion? Or was it just that pituitary growths come and go. and many people have them at times. and this wasn t what was responsible for my muscles bulking?I was right: I d had no instantaneous healing. And the doctors still didn t know where to look for an answer.The following months brought countless opportunities to practice putting down my fears and instead trying to enjoy my life. as difficult as it had become. Crafting a mental picture of a happy outcome helped me to savor these moments. even as death looked more and more certain. I bought a stool so I could sit and rest every few minutes as I made dinner. But I still put on jazz and opened the windows to enjoy the cross breeze while I cooked. just as I d always done.AL amyloidosisThere is no cure for AL amyloidosis. but treatment can give patients more time. In June 2009. I had a stem cell transplant at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. far from our home in western North Carolina. And it did give me more time ― lots more. I ve never asked how much time to expect. I enjoy imagining a long horizon before me. and that might be harder to picture if I knew the statistics.Since my transplant. I ve often walked a length of Folly Beach in South Carolina. Scrub pines stretch ahead to the left. and ocean waves lap to the right. making a long corridor of sand in between. I walk toward what looks like a dead end as the water extends out for miles. But as I approach the waves ahead. I reach the end of the scrub pines and a new vista of coastline opens to the side. ready for me to turn the corner onto the continued path.I ve hunted a quote that says being able to tolerate a lack of closure is a prerequisite for joy. I can t find the quote. Maybe no one said it. but if not. someone should.I live on in my body that has been changed. both from when I was well and from when I was at my sickest. My muscles have softened and grown smaller. but they re bigger than at the start of this journe. I walk. now more slowly. I stretch and gently move toward a fuller range of motion than I ve had recently. I work. cook dinner and connect with friends. now with a more centered and open presence. as though approaching death deepened the days I have left.My Mayo Clinic doctor tells me she ll likely know before I do if the condition becomes active again and if we need to consider a second transplant. I hear that to mean I won t know right away ― not directly from my body ― if it s heading again toward a death that s sooner than  sometime. Every three months I send blood and urine to Mayo Clinic. As I wait for results. I savor the moments. That quarterly wait reminds me to stretch and grow in new ways. to take the kids for ice cream. to soak up the beauty of the trees. I could die soon. Or not. And whatever is ahead for me. and however soon or not. right now. life. with all its brevity. immensity and mystery. feels sweet.Sally Massagee lives in western North Carolina with her husband and Great Dane.

It s no secret that a lack of sleep can make you grumpy. but now new research shows that a bad night s rest may make you more selfish. too.Data published recently The first study monitored the brains of 24 people after a night of good sleep and a night of sleep deprivation. Participants were asked to fill out a helping behavior questionnaire that required them to note what they d do in difficult situations — like if they saw a hurt animal on the side of the road or if they would offer their seat to an older person on a crowded bus.Researchers also took MRIs of their brains as they completed a social cognition task that required them to view  controlled information cards depicting various adults based in the U.S.  and determine the personalities of the silhouettes on the cards. During the MRI. parts of the brain that are associated with empathy were less active after a night of no sleep.Additionally. participants overall  demonstrated a significant decrease in the desire to help others under conditions of sleep deprivation.  the study stated.The second study tracked more than 100 people online for three or four nights via self-reported information measuring how much and how well they slept. The survey asked participants how many times they woke up. how many hours they slept. what time they woke up and more. As expected. the results suggested that a night of bad sleep resulted in less of a desire to help other people.The third study examined the impact that daylight saving time has on charitable giving through an analysis of countrywide donation data from 2001 to 2016. This study found that  the transition to DST was associated with a significant decrease in the altruistic decision to give away money (make donations) compared to the weeks either before or after the transition. Even as little as a loss of one hour of sleep. as in the daylight saving time study. seemed to result in a worse mood for research subjects. Specifically. the study stated.  impaired positive mood can influence helping. in part by lowering empathic sensitivity to the needs or distress of others. All of this to say. if you re not sleeping well. you won t be your best and most giving self ― a vital value that can improve your well-being.Studies show thatlower levels of inflammation in the bodymay be keeping you up at nightBeyond this. when you re looking at your phone. you aren t letting your brain power down after a long day.Sasha Hamdanipreviously told HuffPost When your brain is engaged and active. it is less likely to shut off.  she said.Nature is a natural stress reliever. which is why thinking about the great outdoors can help you fall asleep. according to Jeffrey Durmer. a board-certified sleep medicine physician and sleep coach to the U.S. Olympic Weightlifting Team.previously told HuffPostRoutines are crucial for your day and are just as important for a good night of sleep.previously told HuffPost One might want to look into establishing the routine of going to bed around the same time every night. This can help establish the circadian rhythm ― the body s sleep-wake cycle. Other soothing activities could include taking a warm bath. skin care. reading a book. etc..  she said. A good bedtime routine can look different for everyone. but if you are having trouble sleeping. you should try to incorporate some soothing activities into your evening.

An Oklahoma news anchor has revealed she suffered the early symptoms of a stroke live on air Saturday morning when she began stumbling over her words and said she wasn t feeling right.  I m sorry. something is going on with me this morning. and I apologize to everybody.  Julie Chin of Tulsa s KJRH said at the time. before passing over to the meteorologist for her report.revealed in a Facebook post The episode seemed to have come out of nowhere.  she wrote.  I felt great before our show. However. over the course of several minutes during our newscast things started to happen. First. I lost partial vision in one eye. A little bit later my hand and arm went numb. Then. I knew I was in big trouble when my mouth would not speak the words that were right in front of me on the teleprompter. If you were watching Saturday morning. you know how desperately I tried to steer the show forward. but the words just wouldn t come. Her colleagues recognized she was having a medical emergency and called 911.  I m so grateful for your quick action.  Chin told them.Thankfully. Chin said her tests  have all come back great.  Doctors believe she did not experience a  full stroke.  she said.  There are still lots of questions. and lots to follow up on. but the bottom line is I should be just fine.  Chin said.Most importantly. she added. she d learned that it s not always obvious when someone has a stroke and quick action is critical. She offered an acronym that helps identify symptoms to look for: BE FAST. The acronym is a reminder to watch out for changes in balance. eyes (changes in vision). face (facial droop). arms. speech and timing. And. if the symptoms fit. then  be fast  and call 911. Chin said she d be back at work in a few days and thanked all who had reached out with well wishes.,Health News
The White House announced that it will stop sending out free at-home COVID testing kits on Friday. Sept. 2 due to a lack of funding. Since January 2022. every household in the United States has been able to place three orders for a total of 16 test kits. regardless of their insurance status. The 600 million tests that were distributed boosted access to testing. and according to research on free at-home test programs. likely helped slow the spread of COVID to an extent.Free and affordable COVID tests are still out there. but people will have to get a little more resourceful in order to get ahold of them. Here s where and how: The federal government is still requiring private insurance companies to cover up to eight tests a month per person who is insured. David M. Souleles. the director of the COVID-19 Response Team at the University of California. Irvine. said health insurance and managed care plans are handling this differently. so you ll want to check in with your provider to figure out how you can get reimbursed. Some insurance providers require you to submit a receipt for the tests. whereas others have relationships with local pharmacies that can run your insurance at the cashier so you don t have to pay anything upfront.  It really varies. so people should really check with their health insurance provider about the best option for accessing those covered tests.  Souleles said.Medicare and Medicaid similarly cover up to eight over-the-counter tests each month. Simply bring your red. white or blue Medicare card to a pharmacy and the pharmacy will bill Medicare for your kits. Here is a list of the pharmacies participating in Medicare s over-the-counter tests initiative (though you should also ask your local pharmacy if they are participating even if they re not on the list).Medicare isn t covering OTC test kits for people who only have Medicare Part A (hospital insurance). If you have any questions about your coverage. you can call Medicare at 1-800-Medicare and TTY users can contact the program at 1-877-486-2048.  Again people should check. if they re covered by Medicare or Medicaid. with their providers about the best way to access those tests.  Souleles said.There are over 1.500 community-based locations across the country that offer free or low-cost testing to everyone in the U.S.. including those who are uninsured. These sites. which you can locate here. include local pharmacies. health clinics. community health centers and churches that provide no or low-cost testing. You can contact your local health department for more details about where. when and how you can get tested. Resources vary from place to place. and what s available in one county will be different from what s available in another. In California. a program called OptumServe is offering free testing to uninsured and underinsured people along with undocumented individuals. people experiencing homelessness and those who are at high-risk and need COVID medications. Many other states. or local health departments. may have similar testing programs set up.  One of the things I would really recommend for folks. if they don t have health insurance and they re not on Medicare or Medicaid. is to check with their local health department about what testing options and resources may be available in their community.  Souleles said.Another good place to start your search for a test is your primary care physician. said Dr. David O Gurek. interim chair and associate professor of family and community medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University. Primary care physicians are typically tapped into local resources and will have reliable information on some of the local free testing programs. They ll also be able to test you and help you navigate the hoops of being reimbursed for tests and treatments by your health insurance provider.  Usually. I start with the primary care office because they re aware of that. and from a community health perspective. are tapped into what resources are available in the local community.  O Gurek said. Souleles said he always tells people to take advantage of the testing that s accessible to them.  If you can get eight tests a month. get eight tests a month and have them available.  he said. When you need an at-home COVID test. you typically need a handful. since it can take a few days of testing to produce a positive test result. Some people may also go through a bunch of tests when trying to determine if they re no longer positive after being sick. How many tests you should keep in your closet really depends on your situation. O Gurek said. For example. people who live alone will likely need fewer tests than those who live in a multi-person household. In addition. people who live in rural areas that lack testing may benefit from having a few more tests handy.  I do think each person just needs to be thoughtful about their own situation and circumstances and have tests on hand and available to them.  O Gurek said. Keep in mind that all of the tests have expiration dates. however. if you re past your kit s expiry date. don t toss it. The federal government has been extending expiration dates by about three to six months as we ve learned that many of the test kits work well past the original shelf life listed. You can check the Food and Drug Administration s website to see if your kit s shelf life has been extended. Though the federal government s free OTC test program is ending. there will still be ways to get ahold of some free or cheap tests — it just might take a bit of digging.  People should just be aggressive and check in with all of their local resources — health departments. community clinics — to try and identify those tests and get them so that they have them available when they need them.  Souleles said. ,Health News

Next month marks 15 years since I was diagnosed with bipolar II. and the challenges of managing the disorder still constantly sucker-punch me in the stomach. So. happy anniversary to me. I guess.At 21. I d moved from my home base in Texas to New Jersey. After completing a successful summer internship at Dolce & Gabbana in Manhattan. it appeared I had the world at my fingertips. While I was excited about the change. the dark cloud that had been threatening my disposition for a few years grew too heavy. The world was my oyster. but I soon learned that it would be accompanied by an unwelcome formidable foe.After an unforgettable summer. I returned to Texas with renewed perspective and zeal to pursue my goals. But sadly. within nine months. I experienced back-to-back deaths in our family — and that s when my life changed forever. One day. after class during my second year of college. what was ordinarily a peaceful drive home on the busy I-45 highway in Houston turned into the beginning of a downward spiral. I experienced a panic attack. an event that was entirely foreign to me. complete with shallow. labored breathing and frightening disorientation. When I finally made it home. I sobbed. overcome by anxiety. How did the strong. focused girl who was on a carefully plotted path hit a concrete wall?There followed three years of misdiagnoses and unhelpful approaches. Paxil for depression first. which proved ineffective. A therapist for managing uncontrollable thoughts. which was both ineffective and comical. An attempt at handling it on my own because I was raised to be a  tough  Black woman — this was scary. lonely and also ineffective.My dear mom carried the weight of the world and the darkness of her past on her shoulders with grace. a calm nature and a smile. I was expected to follow suit. and to juggle anything the world threw at me with aplomb. I was cool with that. After all. there s nothing wrong with a little inner grit and unwavering faith. right?Well. kind of. Stress management is great. Not being able to recognize when you re in over your head. or even succumbing to the idea that seeking help is a weakness. is not. One in 4 people will be diagnosed with anxiety disorder. and depression is also very common. with an incidence rate of about 10% or 1 in 10 at any given time.  says Sabrina Gratia. a Black woman psychiatrist based in Brooklyn. New York.  So. the more people are talking about it. I think maybe there s less and less of a stigma. Despite learning these stats. I still struggled to accept that I had a mental health disorder. Things are getting better now. but it was pretty taboo. especially in the Black community.I was diagnosed with bipolar II at a time when everyone thought there was only one type of bipolar disorder. Instead of the strong mood swings that are characteristic of bipolar I — phases of high-energy euphoria. interspersed with emotional and physical exhaustion — bipolar II generally involves more stints of depression and less severe mood swings. called hypomania.Gratia points out that the bipolar II experience can be painfully unique for Black women. We re a double minority. first off. so there are multiple layers of stigma involved.  It s like you have to be strong and not talk about it ― and that s not helpful.  she says.  Some [of my patients] are like ‘I have to take on everything.  or ‘I m the pillar of my family.  or something like that. But you are human. and you need time and space for yourself. Throughout my 20s. significant life changes exacerbated the symptoms of my disorder: my first time living solo in a fast-paced city. a high-stress  dream  job as a fashion buyer. and coming into my own as a young woman. all while trying to be the stalwart Black woman I was expected to be at home and at work. The lack of community ― of a place where people like me could share our experiences of bipolar II freely ― really hurt. While depression is more widely accepted among my white peers. it s often brushed under the rug for women of color. It felt as if I wasn t allowed to be my whole. human. vulnerable self.Some of Gratia s Black women patients feel trapped at work too.  You re supposed to be a strong Black woman. but there s tone policing and things like that.  Gratia says.  So there s always this balance that you have to figure out. and that can be very frustrating.  I commiserate on that end: While achieving a measure of success by the world s standards. I was fake-happy — smiling on the outside while drowning internally.The lyrics to Kendrick Lamar s  Mother I Sober  resonated with me ― in particular. the line  You ain t felt grief till you felt it sober.  There were days I would drink to self-medicate while avoiding the prescribed lithium. the drug meant to keep the depressive spells at bay and lower the chances of suicidal thoughts. This isn t going to defeat me. I told myself. You re stronger than this. Gabrielle.Sometimes acceptance can be just as powerful as the feeling of denial ― except one of them offers a path forward. and the other keeps you woefully stagnant. I mourned the happy-go-lucky former me. But she was gone. and I was a new person. Not broken. just new.It took approximately three years to get to the level of acceptance that compelled me to act. Facing my bipolar head-on with meds. therapy and faith-based hope (what I like to call  pills and prayers ) has helped me to cope with this chronic disability.Now. at 35. I feel more solace than shame. Mental health is being discussed more than ever before. And I m comforted to know there are others like me out there. During the past few years. especially with social media. I think more people are talking about mental health and their mental health struggles.  Gratia says.  It s not seen as if there s something wrong with you or your perspective — I think that s the big fear people have.  She points out that many of our role models in society (for example. athletes and artists who we consider strong and successful) openly talk about their mental health. and they re living life.There are days when I still grieve what may be a lifelong battle. But I realize I m on the front lines with millions of others who take each blow day to day. with confidence that we ll come out victorious. I ve yet to find a support group. but my journey does include a trusted support system. which is necessary for anyone trying to navigate mental illness. I think the number one thing is to have a great relationship with the person diagnosing you and prescribing medication. It s a journey. and you want to feel comfortable that you can ask questions.  Gratia says. She likens it to going to the gym and working with a trusted trainer to get healthier — which is a process.  I can t just go to the gym once a month and expect results. I ve got to put in the time and the work. I definitely see a higher demand for mental health services. which means people are getting help. I now realize the importance of advocating for myself through working with a therapist I trust. consistently taking medicine. and adjusting my lifestyle so I feel as balanced as possible. I still have my bad days. but making the choice to be candid about who I am and what I need. and not ashamed of it. helps keep my blessings at the forefront. and harness the power of acceptance to move forward.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — Barbara Ehrenreich. the author. activist and self-described  myth buster  who in such notable works as  Nickel and Dimed  and  Bait and Switch  challenged conventional thinking about class. religion and the very idea of an American dream. has died at age 81.Ehrenreich died Thursday morning in Alexandria. Virginia. according to her son. the author and journalist Ben Ehrenreich. She had recently suffered a stroke. She was. she made clear. ready to go.  Ben Ehrenreich tweeted Friday.  She was never much for thoughts and prayers. but you can honor her memory by loving one another. and by fighting like hell. She was born Barbara Alexander in Butte. Montana. and raised in a household of union supporters. where family rules included  never cross a picket line and never vote Republican.  She studied physics as an undergraduate at Reed College. and received a PhD in immunology at Rockefeller University. Starting in the 1970s. she worked as a teacher and researchers and became increasingly active in the feminist movement. from writing pamphlets to appearing at conferences around the country. She also co-wrote a book on student activism.  Long March. Short Spring.  with her then-husband. John Ehrenreich.A prolific author who regularly turned out books and newspaper and magazine articles. Ehrenreich honed an accessible prose style that brought her a wide readership for otherwise unsettling and unsentimental ideas. She disdained individualism. organized religion. unregulated economics and what Norman Vincent Peale famously called  the power of positive thinking. A proponent of liberal causes from unions to abortion rights. Ehrenreich often drew upon her own experiences to communicate her ideas. The birth of her daughter Rosa helped inspired her to become a feminist. she later explained. because she was appalled at the hospital s treatment of patients. Her battle with breast cancer years ago inspired her 2009 book  Bright-Sided.  in which she recalled the bland platitudes and assurances of well wishers and probed the American insistence — a religion. she called it — on optimism. to the point of ignoring the country s many troubles. We need to brace ourselves for a struggle against terrifying obstacles. both of our own making and imposed by the natural world. And the first step is to recover from the mass delusion that is positive thinking.  she wrote. Positive thinking has made itself useful as an apology for the crueler aspects of the market economy. If optimism is the key to material success. and if you can achieve an optimistic outlook through the discipline of positive thinking. then there is no excuse for failure. The flip side of positivity is thus a harsh insistence on personal responsibility. For  Nickel and Dimed.  one of her best known books. she worked in minimum wage jobs so she could learn firsthand the struggles of the working poor. whom she called  the major philanthropists of our society.  They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for. they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect. they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high.  she wrote.  To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor. a nameless benefactor. to everyone. Ehrenreich wrote for The New York Times. The Nation. Vogue and many other publications. and her other books included  The Worst Years of Our Lives: Irreverent Notes from a Decade of Greed.   Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War  and  Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class. ,Health News
The Department of Veterans Affairs announced Friday that. for the first time. it will begin providing access to abortion services and counseling to the nation s hundreds of thousands of female veterans and VA beneficiaries.The VA s decision is monumental. but it comes with restrictions: The agency will only provide abortions in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape. incest or when the life of the woman is at risk. This is a patient safety decision.  Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough said in a statement.  Pregnant veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That s what our nation owes them. and that s what we at VA will deliver. Asked why McDonough decided to limit the VA s abortion services to cases of rape. incest or a woman s life being at risk. a VA spokesperson told HuffPost.  At this time. VA is responding to the emergency need to protect the life and health of our nation s Veterans. The VA s move comes roughly two months after conservatives on the Supreme Court gutted Roe v. Wade. the landmark 1973 decision that provided a constitutional right to an abortion.McDonough has been under pressure from Democrats to use his authority to ensure that veterans and VA beneficiaries have access to reproductive care in the wake of Roe v. Wade s demise. Last month. more than two dozen Democratic senators — half of the Senate Democratic caucus — wrote to McDonough urging him to act  immediately.  They were very happy with Friday s news. Today. I m grateful that Secretary McDonough and the Biden Administration are taking a landmark step to help address the health care crises that Republicans are causing across the country.  said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). chair of the Senate Committee on Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions and a senior member of the Veterans  Affairs Committee. For the first time ever. the Veterans Health Administration will finally be able to provide abortion care to ensure none of our veterans or their eligible dependents will have to face medical emergencies — or stay pregnant after a rape or incest — simply because Republican politicians think they know what s best for them.  she said.Unlike the Department of Health and Human Services. the VA is not bound by the Hyde Amendment. the legislative provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases where a pregnancy is caused by rape. incest or when the women s life is at risk. That means VA leaders chose to put Hyde-like restrictions in place despite the agency not being required to.Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). who led the Senate Democratic push on McDonough to take this action. said Friday in a joint statement that they re glad to see the agency  heeding our calls.  But they urged the VA to drop its restrictions on abortion access. This is an important first step. The VA must go further and provide these services to all veterans. regardless of circumstances.  they said.  It s critical that women are trusted and free to make decisions about their bodies. The VA got the ball rolling on its policy change late Thursday by submitting an interim final rule to the Federal Register to allow the agency to begin providing abortion-related services. The new services will be authorized immediately after this rule is published. according to the VA. and then the rule will be available for public comment for 30 days. After that. the VA will begin providing abortions services in  as many locations as possible. Here s a copy of the VA s interim final rule:VA officials say they concluded that access to  medically necessary abortions  is essential for preserving the life and health of veterans and VA beneficiaries. They pointed to adverse health consequences to not providing abortions in these circumstances. like increased risk infertility. significant morbidity or even death.  We came to this decision after listening to VA health care providers and Veterans across the country. who sounded the alarm that abortion restrictions are creating a medical emergency for those we serve.  Dr. Shereef Elnahal. the VA s under secretary for health. said in a statement.  Offering this care will save Veterans  health and lives. and there is nothing more important than that. The VA says its health care providers will consult with individual female veterans on a case-by-case basis to make determinations on when a pregnancy may put that veteran s life at risk. In cases of rape or incest. self-reporting from a veteran or VA beneficiary is considered  sufficient evidence  for proceeding with abortion services.As for veterans who live in states with new restrictions or even bans on abortions in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned. the VA makes it clear the federal government has the upper hand over state laws. VA employees. when working within the scope of their federal employment. may provide authorized services regardless of state restrictions.  reads a VA statement.,Health News
American Journal of PhysiologyThe Finnish research featured a randomized controlled trial of 48 people with cardiovascular disease risk factors such as obesity. high blood pressure and a family history of heart disease.Participants were broken into three groups. The first group exercised and then used a sauna for 15 minutes. the second just exercised and the third was sedentary. The reason behind this is not fully known. but the research suggested that part of the reason for these outcomes is that combining exercise with heat can improve the heart s ability to contract. Ongoing sauna use could also help the heart work more efficiently. it added.can result in less stresshave heart health benefitsDr. Peter Robinsonolks are starting to do more comparison or randomized studies. mainly short-term. to see if this association is really coming from the sauna itself or is it just associated with a healthier lifestyle.  he said.While there is currently no definitive evidence that saunas alone are the cause of these better outcomes. there is reason to believe that the combination of sauna use and exercise does in fact benefit cardiovascular health. Robinson said.Studies are now aiming to find proof that medical experts can rely on.Earlier research has also pointed to a relationship between sauna use and better cardiovascular health. Robinson said.improved artery health through a metric called endothelial function. he continued. Those are two broad markers that we can measure directly in the short-medium term that often have long-term cardiovascular benefits.  he said.Though Robinson said that people who take  sauna baths. especially the way they do them in Finland ... seem to be healthy and seem to live longer.  he wondered whether some of the benefits might come down to socioeconomic factors allowing for a healthier lifestyle.necessary medicinesSauna baths are still far from the point where doctors can recommend them to patients as treatment. Robinson said. but  the more I m reading about it. the more it does seem they are coming up with data that there could be a causation. In other words. as these studies continue to find connections between sauna use and heart health. it s likely that direct. medically backed proof could emerge.Many studies that focus on the health benefits of sauna bathing do not allow people with certain conditions — like low or high blood pressure — to take part. Robinson said.So before adding sauna bathing to your routine. you should consider talking with your doctor to make sure it s safe for you.If you are a healthy individual with no medical problems. you are probably OK to incorporate sauna bathing into your workout schedule. Robinson said.Finally. remember that the Finnish study saw benefits among people who both exercised and used a sauna. Any heart health boosts related to saunas cannot replace the benefits of working out. Robinson stressed.,Health News
As monkeypox cases increase across the country. so do various misconceptions about how the disease spreads. who it infects and how deadly it is.Myths about infectious diseases can have a major impact on public health efforts. In the past. such misunderstandings have caused people to underestimate their risk. avoid taking precautions that help prevent transmission. and choose not to get vaccinated.One of the worst things that people can do during a public health emergency is fuel myths that cause fear and panic. according to Dr. Jorge Salinas. a hospital epidemiologist at Stanford University. Clear and accurate communication can help people understand their personal risk and feel empowered to take protective steps. We need to stay with the science.  Salinas said.Here. HuffPost sets the record straight and correctssome of the monkeypox misinformation that has circulated recently.Though monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. it primarily spreads through close. intimate contact. But the virus doesn t only spread through sex.Monkeypox transmission requires prolonged. often skin-to-skin contact — which you can have with or without sex. Hugging and cuddling. or even touching bedding and other items that were used by someone with monkeypox. can put you at risk. Is sex required. obligatory. mandatory to acquire monkeypox? The answer is no.  Salinas said.While COVID-19 can easily be contracted through aerosols in the air. getting monkeypox is more difficult. said Dr. Katherine Baumgarten. the medical director of infection control and prevention at Ochsner Health. Monkeypox requires that prolonged. close contact with an infected person s skin lesions. large respiratory droplets or contaminated objects. This is not COVID-19. This is not a highly infectious. highly transmissible respiratory virus.  Salinas added.Salinas doesn t think monkeypox is capable of causing the same havoc that COVID-19 did. Pandemic viruses tend to be highly transmissible respiratory viruses that can spread in the pre-symptomatic phase. which makes them hard to control.That said. monkeypox is still a public health problem. and you should take precautions. I m not saying monkeypox is easy to control. but it is not as difficult — it s not in the same ballpark — as respiratory viruses.  Salinas said.Monkeypox is primarily spreading among men who have sex with men. along with nonbinary individuals and transgender women who have sex with men. The risk is greatest among people with multiple sexual partners. but anyone who is intimately exposed to monkeypox can contract it. The virus is not selective about who it infects. Baumgarten said. Instead. it really just has to do with the mode of transmission.Monkeypox seems to proliferate within this particular social network because it has more opportunities to spread through close contact. But this doesn t mean that the virus can t get into other circles. In fact. it likely already did but then burned out before it had the chance to spread further.  This virus can be transmitted from person to person through close skin-to-skin contact. no matter what activity or what gender the person is.  Salinas said. The disease was first identified in the late 1950s and has been endemic in certain West and Central African countries.Though monkeypox doesn t typically break out of endemic regions like these. it s not unheard of. The U.S. has seen sporadic cases in the past when people traveled to such areas or were exposed to imported animals that were infected. It has not been largely transmissible as it has been more recently. But it has been around for a long time and just has not had the opportunity to spread throughout populations like it is now.  Baumgarten said. Very few people die from monkeypox in general. according to Salinas. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s case data indicates that no monkeypox deaths have been confirmed in the current U.S. outbreak.  The strain that s circulating right now is not very deadly. And in the past. it only had been associated with a less than 1% mortality.  Baumgarten said.The vast majority of people who contract monkeypox do not need to be hospitalized and can manage their symptoms — which commonly include fever. body aches and painful skin lesions — from home. Salinas said.But even though the disease isn t usually life-threatening. it can still be dangerous. In certain cases. the lesions can cause vision problems or issues with urinating and defecating.  It s clinically mild because people don t die or need to be hospitalized. But at the same time. it can be a serious problem.  Salinas said.,Health News
COVID-19updated to match the newest omicron strainstweaked shotsThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the new combination shots. half the original vaccine and half protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron versions now responsible for nearly all COVID-19 infections.Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began weighing how best to use them. The CDC s ultimate decision is the final step before shots begin.It s important  to simplify our recommendations.  CDC s Dr. Melinda Wharton cautioned the advisory panel.The original COVID-19 vaccinesBut those vaccines were designed to target the virus strain that circulated in early 2020. Effectiveness drops as new mutants emerge and the longer it s been since someone s last shot. Since April. hospitalization rates in people over age 65 have jumped. the CDC said.The new updated shots are only for use as a booster for people who ve had primary vaccinations regardless of brand or how many booster doses they ve had until now. Pfizer s option is for people 12 and older while Moderna s is for adults only.A big unknown: Exactly how much benefit people will get from one of those extra shots.The FDA cleared the updated boosters based largely on clinical trials of prior tweaks to the vaccine recipe. including the companies  testing of shots targeting an earlier omicron strain that was found safe and able to rev up virus-fighting antibodies. Rather than waiting another few months for more human testing of the BA.5 version. the agency accepted mouse testing showing it also sparked a good immune response.Before this new booster update. people 50 and older already were urged to get a second booster of the original vaccine — and those who did saw some extra protection especially the longer it had been since their last shot. said CDC s Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles.The new combination booster  should provide at least similar or better protection against omicron since it ll be a better match  to today s virus strains. she told the panel.Still. many scientists say to get the maximum benefit. people will need to wait longer between their last vaccination and the new booster than the two months that the FDA set as the minimum.Waiting four to six months between vaccinations is commonly advised. said virologist Andrew Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If someone already has lots of antibodies in their bloodstream. another shot won t rev up that many more. essentially wasting it. You usually want to space out a vaccine booster.  said Pekosz. who is closely watching where CDC draws that line.  Those recommendations are really going to be critical in terms of how good this vaccine is going to be. ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration hopes to make getting a COVID-19 booster as routine as going in for the yearly flu shot.to sell the newly authorized shotShots of the updated boosters. specifically designed by Pfizer and Moderna to respond to the omicron strain. could start within days. The U.S. government has purchased 170 million doses and is emphasizing that everyone will have free access to the booster.at least half of U.S. adults get a flu shot We expect them to provide more durable protection over time.  Jha said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.  The goal very much is to get to a point where people get their COVID shot on a regular basis. the way they do their flu shot. Community health workers in North Carolina. home to the country s lowest COVID-19 booster rate. like the strategy. especially because of confusion among some people about vaccine schedules. I believe in keeping things simple.  said Marty Stamey. an outreach coordinator for the Mountain Area Health Education Center in western North Carolina.  I ve heard a lot of people say. ‘I think I ll just wait and try to do it like the flu shots.  The White House plan also relies in part of on local health departments. providers and community groups to reach out and encourage people to get the updated booster. Pharmacies. health providers and state or local health departments are preparing to send text messages to millions of people that will encourage them to get a booster this fall. White House officials said.Jha said he recommends most Americans get the booster by the end of October.Still. this latest vaccination campaign faces several challenges.majority of Americans got their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccineearlier this year for the COVID-19 responseAnd COVID-19 funding is drying up for many of the community groups that received millions of federal tax dollars to hire workers who spent months reaching deep into neighborhoods with door knocks. mobile vaccine clinics and posters encouraging people to inoculate against COVID-19.White House officials say those local leaders deserve a lot of credit for stamping out misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine and convincing many around the country that the shot will protect them. Those are the really critical messengers.  Jha said.That on-the-ground work has been crucial to getting people vaccinated in the rural. Spanish- and Haitian-speaking communities that the Migrant Clinicians Network has reached throughout Texas. California and Maryland with its $8.5 million federal grant. Simply having the vaccines available is one thing. but getting the shots in the arms is another.  said Amy Liebman. a chief program officer for the nonprofit group.vaccination rates among children under 12 up7% of children under 5was made available this summerDr. Niharika Khanna at the University of Maryland School of Medicine has just started making progress on convincing new mothers that the vaccine is safe and effective for their babies.Her program. which has hired more than 269 health workers and administered more than 12.000 vaccinations and boosters across Delaware. Maryland. Virginia and West Virginia. isn t quite ready to transition back to pushing COVID-19 boosters. All of these people. all of these relationships we ve carefully cultivated are at risk for falling apart.  Khanna said.  Today if you were to say to me switch to booster. I d say no.

A South Carolina legislator who said earlier this month he had lost sleep over the consequences of a six-week abortion ban he supported just inexplicably voted to enact an even stricter one.didn t sleep for a weekeven stricter abortion banFacebookhe wrotesix-week abortion ban There s a 50% chance — greater than 50% chance — that she s going to lose her uterus. There s a 10% chance that she will develop sepsis and herself die.  Collins said of the situation earlier this month. That type of ordeal. medical experts and activists have long warned. perfectly encapsulates the problem with using life-saving exceptions to justify abortion bans. and it further reinforces the need for patients and their doctors to make their own reproductive health decisions without legislative interference. Collins. despite the concerns he admitted earlier this month. doesn t even sound so sure that the new bill he voted to pass won t present the same risks to women s lives and well-being.  I hope that we cleared as many unintended consequences as we could.  he told PBS Newshour on Wednesday when pressed to say if he s absolutely sure this law won t harm women s lives.

This article is part of HuffPost s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe. Some Republicans really don t want you to know about their positions on abortion.One of them is Blake Masters. the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate in Arizona. Until recently. his campaign website promoted him as a  100% pro-life  candidate and pledged support for  a federal personhood law (ideally a Constitutional amendment) that recognizes that unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed.  Then. last week. correspondents from NBC News learned the website s language had changed. The reference to Masters as a  100% pro-life  candidate? Gone. Mention of the personhood law? That s vanished. too.Instead. the website now touts his opposition to late-term abortion and support for the Hyde Amendment. which prohibits the use of taxpayer funds to finance abortion. Something similar has happened in Michigan. where Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett is running for a U.S. House seat. Barrett s website once touted his opposition to abortion under any circumstance and his promise that  I will always work to protect life from conception.  As recently as this past May. he told Melissa Nann Burke of the Detroit News he opposed allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest. But at some point. the abortion section vanished from Barrett s website. When Burke and her colleague Craig Mauger asked Barrett for an explanation. he said he wasn t aware of the change but assumed it was a routine update to focus on issues more important to voters.It was a strange explanation. given that two polls from the previous week found abortion to be the No. 1 issue in Michigan right now. By Monday. the website had another update with new language on abortion and. echoing the new Masters website. it focused on Barrett s opposition to late-term abortion. Washington PostPoliticoThere are probably more such examples out there. with more likely to come. And it s not hard to figure out what these Republicans are trying to do here — although whether their gambit succeeds will depend a lot on how much voters are paying attention.The Supreme Court s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Care. which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended its guarantee of abortion rights. has sparked a political backlash capable of changing the outcome of elections in November. You can see it in the polls showing majorities opposing the Dobbs decision. You can see it in the figures for new voter registration. which consist disproportionately of women. younger voters and Democrats. Or you can see it in the outcome of recent special elections. including last week s surprise win by an underdog Democrat in a swing district from upstate New York.Republicans are reacting to this the way politicians always do when they find themselves on the wrong side of a public opinion divide: by trying to change the subject and. when they can t do that. by disguising or distancing themselves from their previously stated. more unpopular position. In this case. that means scrubbing references to total bans on abortion and shifting the focus to late-term abortion. where Republican support for prohibitions has traditionally polled well.It s an open question whether the strategy will work this time. Democrats have an answer on late-term abortion ― namely. that the procedure is rare and comes up in medically dire. ethically complex cases in which judgment is best left to a woman and her doctor. Although that hasn t always proved persuasive in the past. reactions might be different in the wake of Dobbs. given how the Supreme Court s ruling has focused public attention on questions of bodily autonomy ― i.e.. who actually gets to make these sorts of decisions.And even if the Democrats  argument remains unpersuasive. it s not clear how much voters will care when abortion at any stage ― under almost any circumstances ― is already unavailable in some parts of the country and on the verge of becoming unavailable in even more.Michigan is the perfect example. A 1931 law prohibits abortion. with only a narrow exception for the life of the mother. A series of lower state court rulings have blocked enforcement. but only temporarily. Its legality in the future depends on how the state Supreme Court rules in a series of cases before it. who controls statewide offices and the state legislature. and whether a reproductive rights amendment gets onto the ballot and passes. All of that is up for grabs in November. And while the outcome of Barrett s bid won t affect that literally ― he s now running for U.S. House. not state legislature ― he s part of a broader Republican ticket that has long supported bans on abortion. At the head of that ticket is gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon. who has said she supports the 1931 law. including its lack of exceptions.In the hypothetical scenario in which Barrett wins. it s likely Republicans are winning a bunch of other races as well. and the chances of that 1931 law taking full effect go way up. To put it another way. whether abortion remains legal in Michigan depends on whether state voters realize access to the procedure at any stage is in jeopardy ― the very thing that Barrett s campaign website change makes ambiguous.Likewise. if Barrett and Masters and all the other Republicans altering their website language make it to Washington. that will mean more votes in Congress for more aggressive national restrictions on abortion ― maybe even including a total nationwide ban. at any stage of pregnancy. That type of legislation is already on the agenda for major anti-abortion groups like Americans United for Life. as Mary Ziegler. a University of California law professor and frequent writer on the subject. explained in The New York Times today.This isn t surprising. It s what these groups and their supporters have been hoping to achieve for decades. But it doesn t appear to be what most Americans want. which is why Republicans who once pledged fealty to this cause seem so reluctant to talk about it now. ,Health News
mascaralash serumslash liftsAs with any chemical process. lash lifts could have side effects. and some people should think twice before booking an appointment.Experts told HuffPost what to know about the safety of lash lifts. A lash lift is similar to the process of a perm for your hair.  said Dr. LaTasha Perkins. a family physician at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.  The same chemicals are used on your lashes to give them a more curled look. When you get a lash lift. a technician applies a silicone mold or shield onto the eyelid using a nontoxic glue. which is the only thing that should touch your skin during the process. The technician then lays the lashes over the mold. which is curved upward and outward to create a curl.Next. a perm solution is added to the lashes and sits for about 15 minutes. That is then wiped off and replaced with a setting solution to finish the process. which in total takes roughly 45 minutes.Once complete. this semipermanent procedure generally lasts until your lashes shed and new ones grow in their place.That typically occurs after about four to six weeks. though this time frame differs from person to person. Perkins added. While lash lifts are considered safe overall. some people. especially those with sensitive skin. may experience skin sensitivity or [an] allergy.  said Dr. Marisa Garshick. a dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology in New York City.In particular. you may have an allergic reaction to the adhesive. which can cause burning. stinging or redness on the skin around the eye. she said.So if you know your skin reacts to certain materials. you may want to reconsider before heading in for an appointment. Plume Hair & Lash ScienceSome people. Perkins said. could also have an allergic reaction to the chemicals or experience general irritation. While the perm solution isn t directly applied to the skin. it could potentially drip into the follicles or be applied by a technician with a not-so-steady hand. The hair can also be affected if the chemicals are left on too long.  resulting in damaged eyelashes. Perkins said.But if you go to an experienced lash lift professional. they should know the ideal amount of time to leave them on. Just do your research in advance to find the best salon for lash lifts near you.widely recognizedStill. you should talk to your OB-GYN before going in for a lash lift. no matter what trimester you re in.Perkins. though. is one of the many experts who believe that you should hold off until you are no longer pregnant. due to the chemical nature of the process.

When they happen on the outside. blood clotting can be a good thing to help prevent excessive bleeding after you ve been injured. Platelets (a type of blood cell) and proteins in your plasma (the liquid part of the blood) band together and form a clot over the injury. which eventually dissolves once the injury has healed.Blood clots that strike inside the body. however. can sometimes block a vein or an artery and have serious consequences. A clot that blocks a vein deep in the body is what s known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs can form in any deep vein but it typically develops in the lower leg. thigh. pelvis or arm.It s estimated that as many as 900.000 people across America can develop a DVT each year. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it s not only a disease of the elderly or extremely ill. DVTs can occur in younger patients without obvious medical issues.  Dr. Vincent Varghese. a board-certified interventional cardiologist at Deborah Heart and Lung Center in New Jersey. told HuffPost.  Awareness and education are critical in early recognition of DVT. The blood in our body exists in a highly regulated balance between promoting blood clots (thrombogenesis) and breaking them down (thrombolysis). Dr. K. Francis Lee. medical director of Advanced Vein Care Center in Springfield. Massachusetts. told HuffPost.  This fine balance is tilted to one side or the other as the need arises.  Lee explained.But there are risk factors that can disrupt this homeostasis. which is categorized as either acquired or inherited.  Acquired risk factors include common ‘trigger  events. such as trauma (major bone fractures). major surgery. immobilization (long-term sedentary or fixed body position. such as following surgery or during long trips). serious infections or cancer.  Lee said.The venous system is considered a passive flow system with low pressure — the muscles in the legs and arms actively pump blood through the vein system. back to the heart and lungs.  When a person is unable to move (say. after a major abdominal surgery). then those muscles in the legs and arms aren t actively moving to pump blood effectively.  Varghese said.  This can lead to a slowing down of blood flow and possible blood clots. Blood thickens around matter that doesn t belong in the veins — so things like tissue debris. collagen or fat that may be released into the blood system after a trauma or major surgery can cause blood to clot too. And if there s damage to the vein walls. this can release naturally-occurring substances that promote blood clotting. according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). There s also an overall inflammatory response in these conditions. which can activate the clotting cascade and lead to blood clot development.  Dr. David Nation. a board-certified vascular surgeon at VeinSolutions in Austin. Texas. told HuffPost.Meanwhile. certain medications (birth control pills. hormone replacement therapy) and diseases (heart failure. kidney disease. cancer) can lead to a thickening of the blood due to various mechanisms. with the potential risk of DVT. There are also dozens of genetic conditions that can increase a person s risk of not only developing DVTs but early-age heart attacks and strokes. As a layperson. it s not practical to remember nor be concerned with every inherited genetic factor for developing blood clots.  Lee said.  But any devastating occurrences (heart attack. stroke. blood clots. recurrent miscarriages) to a family member in their 20s to 40s in age should raise suspicion for an underlying inherited genetic condition that should be tested. The mechanisms behind why COVID-19 may increase the risk of DVT aren t fully understood yet. but there are a few theories. The virus creates an inflammatory state. which can lead to blood clotting too easily.  Nation said.  It also causes direct endothelial injury to the lung tissue — damage to the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels — that can release signals into the bloodstream that stimulate clot formation. It s also been suggested the virus may directly activate the clotting cascade through interactions within the bloodstream. All of these effects are more prominent in patients with a severe COVID-19 infection and much less common in mild cases.Then there s the immobilization factor — from spending days in bed to weeks in intensive care — that can lead to slower blood flow. and as a result. increased risk of blood clot formation. People with COVID-19 or recovering from it should know the key strategy to avoiding DVT is heightened awareness of symptoms and prevention. with prevention largely provided by anticoagulation medications. better known as blood thinners.  Lee said.Preventative anticoagulation is appropriate for most. if not all. hospitalized COVID-infected people unless there s a contraindication.  Specific indications. type. and dose of anticoagulation should be determined by your medical providers.  Lee said.People who ve recovered and are being discharged from the hospital don t need routine preventative measures for anticoagulation. People with risk factors that place them at high risk for DVT should be covered with preventative anticoagulation upon discharge from the hospital.  Lee said.  Although not routine. preventative anticoagulation upon discharge for a period of time appears to be beneficial for those high-risk people. Lee added:  Certainly. those patients who developed DVT while in the hospital should stay on anticoagulation upon discharge for a period of months. as determined by their physician. What about if you were infected with COVID-19 but not sick enough to be hospitalized? You probably don t require routine preventative blood thinners. but if you have any of the risk factors for DVT — recent surgery. trauma. prolonged immobilization due to severe illness. family history — you should be preventatively anticoagulated.Whether you re in your usual state of health or recovering from physical trauma. surgery or infection. the best way to avoid DVT is to remove or minimize as many acquired and inherited risk factors as possible.Know the signs.Symptoms of DVT include swelling. pain or tenderness in your leg. ankle. foot or arm. Other less common symptoms and signs include hip. thigh or back discomfort. unexplained palpitations. fever. dizziness. coughing with tinged blood or general fatigue and malaise. These symptoms may seem unrelated to blood clots in the legs. but they may portend early warnings of a serious DVT blood clot in the making.  Lee said. The quicker you act. the better your outcomes.Keep moving. Exercising regularly improves blood circulation and is one of the most important things a person can do to stave off DVT.  Take a break at work if you sit all day by walking around your work area.  Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj. a board-certified cardiologist with Providence Mission Hospital in Orange County. California. told HuffPost.  Schedule longer walks. take standing breaks and make sure to periodically stretch. Even something as simple as pumping your feet when sitting for extended periods — by lifting your toes in the air for three seconds with your feet flat on the floor — can give your circulation a boost during times when you re more sedentary. The more you move around. the less chance you have of developing a DVT blood clot.Be mindful of medications.Certain medications. such as birth control pills and chemotherapy. can increase your risk of blood clots. When a treatment is unavoidable. be sure to consult with your doctor about prophylactic anticoagulation options.  Lee said. and take your medications exactly as prescribed to maximize efficacy.Wear compression socks.Compression socks may help circulation by preventing blood from pooling in the veins. not only improving blood flow but stimulating the body s own ability to prevent blood clots. according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.This is a particularly helpful strategy to use when traveling. after surgery or during other bouts of inactivity. like when at your desk working.Travel smart. If you re planning to travel on an airplane. wear loose-fitting comfortable clothes. drink plenty of water and stay active by walking around every hour or so.  Bhojraj said.  You should also change your sitting position often and avoid crossing your legs throughout your flight. Quit smoking. Smoking restricts blood flow and increases the risk of blood clots.  Bhojraj said.  It s never too late to quit. Follow a post-surgery protocol.If you have to undergo major surgery and can t be physically active. your doctor will probably implement low-dose blood thinners in either pill or injectable forms. or compression devices on your legs. to prevent blood clots. Varghese said. They may also promote early ambulation (walking or other movements) to lower your risk.The length of time you re on the protocol will vary. depending on the type of surgery you ve had and your other risk factors. but following the protocol — and staying in close contact with your doctor about how it s going — is a super-important part of having a DVT-free recovery.Seek out your family history.Look into whether or not you have a family history of blood clot events. such as early-age heart attacks. strokes. DVTs or unexplained pregnancy complications. If such family history is present. then consult with your physician or a hematologist on whether genetic or hematologic testing may be indicated.  Lee said.  If one family member tests positive for any abnormality. then test everyone among the appropriate family circle in consultation with the physician. This knowledge can be lifesaving — not just for you. but possibly for your parents. siblings and children too.If you experience sudden and persistent swelling. pain or tenderness in your leg. ankle. foot or arm that feels like a charley horse (a sudden and painful muscle cramp) and these symptoms stick around for more than a day or two and get worse. make an appointment with your doctor right away — and if you have shortness of breath or experience sharp chest pains. call 911.When you see your doctor or visit an emergency room. you ll receive a physical exam. A doctor will ask you questions about your health to help determine the likelihood of a DVT blood clot. Make sure to let them know if you ve had a recent surgery or serious injury (think: breaking a bone). cancer. stroke. heart failure. are taking hormones (such as birth control pills) or have traveled for an extended period. as these can all increase your risk. A DVT blood clot is usually diagnosed by ultrasound of the extremity. Depending on the situation. advanced imaging — including a CT. MRI or venogram — may be needed.Blood thinners are the go-to therapy. which helps to dissolve the clot. and are either given intravenously or in pill form.  In the past. the only blood thinning pill was Warfarin. which required frequent bloodwork to monitor levels and efficacy.  Varghese said.  We now have several blood thinning medication options that appear to be safer. better tolerated and don t require frequent blood work. In more severe cases. your physician may recommend removing blood clots from your legs or lungs using minimally invasive procedures or surgery. Veins that are cleared of blood clots lead to much healthier outcomes than those that have residual blood clots or scarring remaining inside the vein.  Lee said.  Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can lead to satisfactory long-term clinical outcomes. ,Health News

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. life expectancy dropped for the second consecutive year in 2021. falling by nearly a year from 2020. according to a government report being released Wednesday.In the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. the estimated American lifespan has shortened by nearly three years. The last comparable decrease happened in the early 1940s. during the height of World War II.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials blamed COVID-19 for about half the decline in 2021. a year when vaccinations became widely available but new coronavirus variants caused waves of hospitalizations and deaths. Other contributors to the decline are longstanding problems: drug overdoses. heart disease. suicide and chronic liver disease. It s a dismal situation. It was bad before and it s gotten worse.  said Samuel Preston. a University of Pennsylvania demographer.Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a baby born in a given year might expect to live. given death rates at that time. It is  the most fundamental indicator of population health in this country.  said Robert Hummer. a University of North Carolina researcher focused on population health patterns.U.S. life expectancy rose for decades. but progress stalled before the pandemic.It was 78 years. 10 months in 2019. In 2020. it dropped to 77 years. Last year. it fell to about 76 years. 1 month.The last time it was that low was in 1996.Declines during the pandemic were worse for some racial groups. and some gaps widened. For example. life expectancy for American Indian and Alaskan Native people saw a decline of more than 6 1/2 years since the pandemic began. and is at 65 years. In the same span. life expectancy for Asian Americans dropped by about two years. and stands at 83 1/2.Experts say there are many possible reasons for such differences. including lack of access to quality health care. lower vaccination rates. and a greater share of the population in lower-paying jobs that required them to keep working when the pandemic was at its worst.The new report is based on provisional data. Life expectancy estimates can change with the addition of more data and further analysis. For example. the CDC initially said life expectancy in 2020 declined by about 1 year 6 months. But after more death reports and analysis came in. it ended up being about 1 year 10 months.But it s likely the declines in 2020 and 2021 will stand as the first two consecutive years of declining life expectancy in the U.S. since the early 1960s. CDC officials said.—Life expectancy for women in the United States dropped about 10 months. from just under 80 years in 2020 to slightly more than 79 in 2021. Life expectancy for men dropped a full year. from about 74 years to 73.—COVID-19 deaths were the main reason for the decline. The second largest contributor was deaths from accidental injuries — primarily from drug overdoses. which killed a record-breaking 107.000 Americans last year.—White people saw the second biggest drop among racial and ethnic groups. with life expectancy falling one year. to about 76 years. 5 months. Black Americans had the third largest decline. falling more than eight months. to 70 years. 10 months—Hispanic Americans had seen a huge drop in life expectancy in 2020 — four years. But in 2021. life expectancy for them dropped by about two months. to about 77 years. 7 months. Preston thinks good vaccination rates among Hispanics played a role.The report also suggests gains against suicide are being undone.U.S. suicides rose from the early 2000s until 2018. But they fell a little in 2019 and then more in 2020. the first year of the pandemic. Experts had wondered if that may have been related to a phenomenon seen in the early stages of wars and national disasters in which people band together and support each other.The new report said suicide contributed to the decline in life expectancy in 2021. but it did not provide detail. According to provisional numbers from a public CDC database. the number of U.S. suicides increased last year by about 2.000. to 48.000. The U.S. suicide rate rose as well. from 13.5 per 100.000 to 14.1 — bringing it back up to about where it was in 2018.___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

monkeypoxannounced Tuesdaysaid in a statement The Texas Department of State Health Services said it is continuing to investigate what role the virus played in his death.  Monkeypox is a serious disease. particularly for those with weakened immune systems.  said Texas DSHS Commissioner Dr. John Hellerstedt.  We continue to urge people to seek treatment if they have been exposed to monkeypox or have symptoms consistent with the disease. The DSHS referred questions about the case to Harris County Public Health. which said that it would not be sharing additional information about the deceased individual out of respect for his family.rash and flu-like symptoms18.000 confirmed casesThe CDC s online case count is typically updated every Wednesday. A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to HuffPost s request for comment on the death in Texas.Symptoms of the virus typically start within three weeks of exposure and the illness typically lasts two to four weeks. according to the CDC.People who have been exposed to monkeypox and people who may be more likely to get monkeypox. including those who have had contact with someone infected with the virus. are advised to get vaccinated. Those wanting to know whether they are eligible for a vaccine can contact their health care provider or local health department. the CDC advises.,Health News
Nighttime is meant to be a period of peace and quiet — restful evenings. pleasant dreams and rejuvenation before another day. But. when you deal with teeth grinding. that probably isn t the case. You end up with pain. tooth issues. and you may even wake up a little tired.Plus. when you deal with teeth grinding ― or bruxism. as it s known medically ― you will likely deal with repercussions that go way beyond the anticipated tooth pain and damage. our dental health can affect your medical health.  said Dr. Floretta Cuffey-Terry. president of Robert T. Freeman Dental Society in Washington. D.C. Here. experts share the signs you should look out for if you think you may be grinding your teeth at night. along with some advice on how to address it.Dr. Albert Coombswner of Smile Services DC and member of the international dental implant associationtemples and back toward the earsCuffey-Terry said. This pain can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. but will likely be at its worst when you wake up in the morning.Jaw pain is not something you should be waking up with automatically. so if you notice this sensation. get in touch with your dentist.It may seem obvious. but if you have tooth pain or tooth soreness in the morning. you may be dealing with bruxism.Dr. Marjan MoghadamAccording to Moghadam.  the act of grinding can cause tooth wear that over time can lead to destruction of the tooth structure itself. as well as the bone that supports the tooth in the jawbone. Specifically. if you re looking in your mouth and notice that your tooth crown (which is the visible part of the tooth) is wearing down. you may be grinding your teeth at night. Cuffey-Terry added. In this instance. you may notice a chip in your tooth or discoloration in the form of white streaks.You may also notice a shift in your teeth. Moghadam added. If you have a tooth that appears to be pushed forward or backward out of nowhere. you may be grinding your teeth while you sleep.According to Coombs. it is also common to experience sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks if you are a chronic grinder. This has to do with the fact that. if you re a prolonged grinder. you ll start to see small fracture lines throughout the teeth.  he said. Those small fracture lines are  almost direct access to the nerve of the tooth. If that glass of ice cold water has a clear path to your tooth s nerve. you better believe you ll feel some sensitivity as soon as you take a sip. Someone who constantly grinds their teeth may not realize it. but they are likely waking themselves up every couple of hours throughout the night. Coombs said.This could be from discomfort or pain. or just the fact that a constantly moving mouth means a disruptive night of rest. As a result. you may be more likely to deal with sleepiness during the day.You re probably very aware that living through a pandemic has been stressful. So have things like inflation and political unrest. to name a few.And stress manifests itself in more ways than you d think. including teeth grinding.The National Institutes of Health  did research in 2020 [that discovered] the linkage between stress and bruxism.  Coombs said.  What they found is 95% of people that are under an immense amount of stress show signs of bruxism. at least 70% increase in bruxismIf you think you re grinding your teeth at night. you should seek professional help from your dentist. Moghadam said. The dentist can examine and evaluate the signs and symptoms in order to rule out any other issue — such as dental infection or other habits that could be contributing. They ll also be able to make recommendations for the best next steps and treatments. which can include mouth guards. muscle relaxers or even stress management. ,Health News

three timesmore than twicefive timesSo Morenzoni did everything in her power to stack the odds in favor of her life and her baby s. She found a Black female obstetrician to care for her during her pregnancy. and a Black doula to support her throughout the process.  I did a lot of working out and clean eating and all.  Morenzoni told HuffPost. Then. at 27 weeks. and without any warning. her blood pressure spiked dramatically. With her medical training. Morenzoni understood the danger that she and her baby were in.  You can t have the blood pressure going up and down like that.  Morenzoni said. She remembers thinking.  I want to be here for my daughter to support her. raise her. to help my husband. Pivoting from the birth plan she was writing with her doula. Morenzoni says she went into  clinical mindset.  I was like. whatever we got to do. just do it. And they went into action. One solace in the midst of this frightening experience was that the Black woman neonatologist who came into Morenzoni s room to speak with her before baby Aria was delivered via emergency C-section had been a NICU baby herself.  Her example and her encouragement. that just really resonated.  Morenzoni remembered. After 110 days in the NICU. with Morenzoni by her side. diligently pumping breast milk every couple of hours. baby Aria finally went home to her parents. Today. she is a joyful. babbling 14-month-old toddler who meets all of the developmental milestones for her age.While Morenzoni and her daughter survived the threats of preeclampsia and preterm birth. not all families  stories end happily. To add to the litany of threats that Black pregnant people and their babies face in the U.S.. we now have another heartbreaking data point.significantly more likelyBabies born in what is known as this  periviable  period. which is between 22 weeks and 25 weeks 6 days. comprised only 0.4% of births in 2015. but accounted for 40% of neonatal deaths.Viability. or a baby s ability to survive outside of the womb. is not guaranteed at a specific date in pregnancy. A baby s odds of survival depend upon multiple factors. plus a sizable quantity of unknowns. When a baby arrives this early. doctors and families must make life-altering choices under intense pressure and tight time constraints. based on clinical information as well as the families  beliefs and preferences. The earlier an infant is born. the less likely they are to survive. and. when they do. the more likely they are to face complications.Kartik K. Venkatesh It s a gray zone.  Venkatesh told HuffPost. It s also a moving target. Just five years ago. said Venkatesh. he and his colleagues would not offer life-saving interventions to babies born before 23 weeks. as it wasn t considered possible that they would survive. But with advances in care. some of these babies are now able to live. The question is. which ones? Who decides which early preterm infants receive interventions that make survival a possibility?Ideally. the decision-making is individualized for each baby s prognosis. and is a shared process between doctors and the family. But when Venkatesh and his colleagues examined the rates at which periviable infants were given assisted ventilation. antibiotics and surfactants to mature the lungs and other organs — the most common efforts doctors deploy to sustain and potentially save these babies  lives — the data revealed a cruel trend. Overall.  said Venkatesh.  Black. Hispanic and Asian infants were about 20% less likely to receive intervention. Many factors are at play in these fraught situations. from a family s religious beliefs to the technology available at a given hospital. But when viewed alongside the existing data about Black infant mortality and Black maternal mortality. the inescapable conclusion is that some of these babies were killed by racism. We adjusted for the kind of traditional kind of epidemiologic factors you d think about. like education and insurance status and age. and we still saw these disparities.  said Venkatesh. Birth records show which interventions doctors used. but don t explain why certain treatments were pursued or not. Venkatesh hopes that the study points the way forward for more research that will illuminate how this is happening. Is it implicit bias? Is it patient preferences? Is it because minority women are receiving care at hospitals where maybe clinical services aren t the best?  said Venkatesh.  We need to understand all that. Dr. Melinda Elliott. a neonatologist and chief medical officer of Prolacta Bioscience. which produces a human milk-based fortifier for premature infants. believes some of the discrepancy is related to cost.  Many premature infants of color are born at inner-city or safety net hospitals.  she said.  There are exceptions. but these hospitals are often less well funded than those in suburban areas.  There is a lot of work that needs to be done to reduce bias and improve the standard of care for infants and women of color. and this starts with accepting that bias exists.  said Elliott. Individual health care providers need to continually look for both internal and external bias. recognize it for what it is. and work to reduce it.  she added. Another critical component of rectifying this disparity is  shared decision-making in an environment where patients are given respect and autonomy.  said Venkatesh. Morenzoni feels that she and her daughter received excellent care from a diverse team of doctors and nurses. but after spending all those days in the NICU observing other families  stories play out. she says that the findings of this study don t surprise her. I advocated for myself.  she explained.  Other mothers that were younger than me. that were not as knowledgeable or just completely fear-stricken.  she said. got  ran over. in a way. with the decision-making. Instead of being asked what they wanted. she said. she saw parents being told by doctors what would be done for their babies.  And sometimes. [people don t receive the same care] just by the issue of our lives not being important enough.  Morenzoni continued.  There s this stigma. especially for Black people. if they feel that we live in poverty. or we have other children. ‘Oh. they ll just have another one.  I work in health care. I ve heard statements like that before. Morenzoni is positioning herself to support and advocate for other new parents. Empowered by her ability to provide Aria with breastmilk during her NICU stay. she has become a certified breastfeeding peer counselor and is in the process of becoming a certified lactation specialist.  This whole experience really opened my eyes.  she said. What I can personally do. as one woman. is to help strengthen and encourage other moms to know that they do not have to feel like they are just another number.  ,Health News
My daughter is crying. Like most toddlers. she has big feelings about snacks. which books to read when mommy or daddy should be allowed to leave the room. and what I. her mother. should wear. On this occasion. she s sad because we ve run out of her beloved granola bars and I ve yet to make it to the store to replenish our supply. Fortunately. I know what will make my 2-year-old feel better.  Would you like to hold your tampon?  I ask. The answer to the above question is always.  Yeah!  For the past few weeks. my daughter has taken what we call her  emotional support tampon  everywhere. For example. the tampon made it to soccer practice and accompanied my kid while creating chalk drawings at the park. It occupies the same role in her life as a  binkie  or a  blankey  does for other kids. The only difference? My child s  emotional support tampon  attracts far more side-eye than a pacifier.My kid s relationship with her tampon began when she saw one that had gotten loose on the counter in the bathroom.  What s that?  she asked. admiring the multi-colored wrapper. It s a tampon.  I said. matter-of-factly. Next. my child wanted to know what it was for. I hadn t thought about when and how I d introduce my offspring to the concept of menstruation. but I made the game-time decision not to start with a lie. In case she remembered this conversation years from now. in the recesses of her mind. I wanted to be as truthful as possible. Um. it s sort of like a Band-Aid for the inside. People who have uteruses bleed sometimes. and tampons help us deal with that.  Do I think my child understood this explanation? Definitely not! Nonetheless. I liked the precedent it set in our household ― one of openness about menstruation. Of course. not everyone approves of our family s decision to be so honest about periods. Once. at the park. a 5-year-old boy sharing the swing set with my daughter pointed to the tampon and sweetly asked what it was. I looked over at his father with an expression that said.  Is it OK if I tell him? Or would you prefer to do it yourself?  Unfortunately. Park Dad s answer was this:  I think kindergarten is a little young for risqué subjects like that.  I didn t push the  menstrual products  conversation with Park Dad. After all. becoming persona non grata at a playground is the worst possible fate when you have a 2-year-old. But I did wonder how anyone could think explaining the purpose of tampons was risqué? It s not like I was recapping the plot of an erotic thriller.Indeed. the attitude that menstruation is a dirty secret that should be kept from children has real consequences. Keeping kids in the dark about body changes and reproduction can lead to real confusion when puberty begins. Research reveals many young people do not know what is happening when they get their first periods. How terrifying is that? Suddenly bleeding out of your vagina ― and not knowing why ― is a traumatic experience. It might even make a kid think they re injured or dying.I went through early puberty. When I was 10 years old. I was the first of my pals to start my period. While I technically knew what it was. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone. As a consequence. I walked around with bloody underwear for days. Sometimes I wonder whether I would have felt less humiliated by my period if the culture surrounding menstruation hadn t been so secretive. I can t remember the women in my family or my friends  families speaking openly about topics like PMS. periods. or menopause. And the men I knew were even worse! I once saw an older male relative have to leave the room during a maxi-pad commercial. He was a father of two. but I guess the bleeding part of the reproductive journey was too much for him.During puberty. my friends and I pieced together snippets of information from Tampax ads we saw during Oprah s commercial breaks. But my daughter s fascination with tampons has inspired me to be transparent about things period-related. I believe the cultural discomfort surrounding menstrual products ― and the periods they exist to deal with – is a symbol of our general discomfort with the idea that our children will one day go through puberty. grow up. and explore their sexuality. But children of all genders will be affected by menses ― either because they ll one day have periods. or because they ll know people who do. Shouldn t they be prepared?I hope that by never making tampons a taboo. my daughter will feel more empowered to discuss menstruation. puberty and sexuality in general. I hope she ll feel confident enough to ask any question that comes to her because I think it s important to prepare kids to become sexually healthy adults. It is simply my goal to raise a kid who is familiar with the language of menstruation from day one. I d rather not raise a person who worries they re bleeding to death when they reach menarche or who is afraid to ask for a tampon like I was. Instead. I m happy to be raising my little tampon enthusiast. Long live the Emotional Support Tampon!Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

SACRAMENTO. Calif. (AP) — California is preparing to spend up to $20 million to bring women from other states to its abortion clinics. a policy aimed at increasing access to a procedure that has been outlawed or restricted in many states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.restricted the moneyan amendmentWhile the fund will receive public money. it also accepts private donations — something the Newsom administration said will be important to cover costs. As the Governor has stated. California is doing its part. but we cannot do it all — private donations and philanthropy will be critical to these efforts.  Newsom spokesperson Alex Stack said.  We all need to step up to support women who are being denied reproductive freedoms by their state governments and are forced to come to California for abortion care. Planned Parenthood None of that matters if we re not also ensuring that patients can get to where they need to go.  she said.  Everyone deserves to get health care. including abortion. and unfortunately for half the country they need to travel outside the state they live in in order to get that. city leadersState lawmakers in Oregon — anticipating an abortion ban in neighboring Idaho — agreed to spend $15 million to help women seek abortions. So far. $1 million has gone to the Northwest Abortion Access Fund. a nonprofit that helps patients pay for travel and the procedure itself. The fund exhausted its planned operating budget this year and had to approve additional emergency funds amid growing demand for travel aid. according to Riley Keane. practical support lead for the group.In California. some of the money could go to Access Reproductive Justice. the state s only statewide abortion support fund. The group usually helps about 500 people per year get abortions. but director Jessica Pinckney said they ve seen an increase since the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Recently. for the first time ever. Pinckney said the group in one week helped more women who lived in other states than they did from California. We re definitely seeing an increase of Texans and Arizonians. We re also starting to see folks coming from Louisiana. Alabama — much further than we would have even anticipated.  Pinckney said.  I still don t necessarily think we have the full story of what things are going to look like now in this post-Roe era. The California Family Council. a nonprofit that opposes abortion rights. has been lobbying against the spending this year. but without much success. Jonathan Keller. the group s president. said the state should be spending tax dollars on what he says are more pressing issues. like homelessness and housing. The idea that the most pressing use of state funds would be to pay for people from red states to fly here to have abortions on the California taxpayer dime is really just a travesty.  he said.The state budget this year authorizes $4.8 billion in spending over three years on an array of housing and homelessness programs. in addition to the $9 billion lawmakers approved last year. according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst s Office.Associated Press reporter Claire Rush contributed from Portland.

seemsDr. Gavriel Kohlberg. an assistant professor of otolaryngology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. hearing loss is really undiagnosed throughout the country. making it under-treated. too. Some of those  regular  annoyances that you deal with day to day may actually be signs that you re losing your hearing. Here. experts share signs that you may be experiencing hearing loss.According to Dr. Kareem Tawfik. an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. one of the most common signs of hearing loss is consistently having to ask loved ones to repeat themselves during normal conversation. Pay attention if you suspect that you re asking loved ones to recite what they just said more often than usual. You can even ask your friends and family for their opinion if you think you may be consistently asking them to repeat what they just said.Kohlberg noted that if you re having trouble hearing environmental noises. you ll likely want to get your hearing checked.Environmental noises can include things like birds chirping. leaves rustling and the beep from kitchen appliances. he said.Take notice if you struggle to hear some expected background noises on your next walk through nature or the next time you re doing things around the house. A lot of people with hearing loss also have a condition called tinnitus.  Tawfik said. Tinnitus is commonly associated with ringing in the ears. but it can also be a buzzing in the ears or  any number of different sounds that are not actually present in the environment but occur as the brain s response to a deprivation of sound from the ears. more than 50 million peopleWhether they know it or not. many people who have hearing loss rely on lip-reading to understand what those around them are saying. If you seem to have trouble understanding someone when they aren t facing you (and you can t see their lips) or when they re wearing a mask. you may want to go get a hearing test.Tawfik noted that many of his patients only noticed their hearing loss because of mask-wearing during the height of the pandemic.  The first environment people notice hearing difficulty is in noisy environments.  Tawfik said. Think crowded restaurants. bars or cocktail parties.He noted that unlike in a quiet space when you re listening to someone one on one. these busy places are considered complex listening environments. They ll immediately put a spotlight on any difficulty someone is having with their hearing. In these places. it s also harder to rely on lip-reading. which. as mentioned above. is something many people with hearing loss rely on.According to Tawfik. if your hearing loss is worse in one ear. it may be a sign of a different problem.  Typically. with age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss. we expect to see hearing loss that s affecting both ears symmetrically.  he said.  So when it doesn t fit that pattern we start to wonder if there s something else going on. He noted that hearing loss in one ear could be a sign of a benign tumor. Additionally. any fluctuating hearing loss (hearing that goes in and out) or hearing loss that is associated with dizziness could be a sign of a chronic condition of the inner ear. he added.In these cases. you ll want to contact a doctor as soon as possible so they can start treatment.  Rarely [do] people have a sudden loss of hearing in one or both ears.  Kohlberg said. Generally. hearing loss is gradual. When hearing loss is sudden. you should have your hearing checked within two weeks. he noted. Sudden hearing loss can be treated. but only when caught early. The most common reason to have hearing loss is because of age-related hearing loss.  Tawfik said. But there are also genetic and environmental factors that can contribute to the development of the condition.People who have certain genetic markers and who have a history of exposure to loud noise (like musicians or some kinds of construction workers) are at an increased risk of hearing loss over time. which makes it crucial for those people (and all of us. actually) to  limit the duration of exposure to loud noise.  he said.It s important that people prevent hearing loss by using noise protection when they know they are going to be in loud environments. Tawfik added.This can mean investing in earplugs. getting over-the-ear muffs. or. if you re someone who is exposed to loud noises often. you  can also consider getting custom ear molds which probably do the best job of blocking out sound.  Tawfik said. As with any condition. it s easier to prevent than treat.Kohlberg said that roughly 30 million people throughout the country have some kind of hearing loss — and it largely affects older people. ,Health News

Though chest pain is the symptom most commonly associated with cardiovascular issues. there are a range of atypical symptoms that may indicate something is wrong with the heart. High blood pressure. blood clots. arrhythmias and valve issues can trigger lightheadedness. dizziness. shortness of breath and jaw pain. Because these symptoms aren t so obviously linked to the heart — and are associated with other health conditions — they often go dismissed. causing people to delay urgent. life-saving care.  The common thing we are concerned about is chest discomfort. but the truth is that cardiovascular issues can actually be signaled by other symptoms.  Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar. a board-certified cardiologist at Providence Saint John s Health Center in Santa Monica. California. told HuffPost. Here are a few symptoms that may signal a heart problem:Pain in the calves or lower legs — especially when it s accompanied by swelling — could be due to a blood clot in the deep veins of the body. according to Tadwalkar. Leg swelling can also occur if the heart has issues pumping blood throughout the body. causing reduced blood flow to the legs.  Pain in the legs. even though it seems like it s so far from the heart. could. in fact. signal that there s something happening with the cardiovascular system.  Tadwalkar said. Dr. Joyce Oen-Hsiao. a cardiologist and associate professor of clinical medicine at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut. has treated many patients who present with dizziness and lightheadedness. But it often takes a bit of detective work to determine what. exactly. is causing these symptoms. Abnormalities in blood pressure — including blood pressure that s either too high or too low — can cause dizziness. Some people will experience heart palpitations. or extra heartbeats. that can trigger lightheadedness. Oen-Hsiao said. Though many arrhythmias are benign and triggered by factors like caffeine or menopause. some irregular heartbeats — including those that occur at the bottom of the heart chamber — can be a sign of heart disease or a blockage in the heart arteries. according to Oen-Hsiao. A severe headache may be a marker that something s amiss with the heart. A frontal headache with pain that shoots across the forehead and behind the eyes can indicate that a person has high blood pressure. according to Oen-Hsiao. Some people don t feel their blood pressure. but at one point. it gets a little too much blood pressure for their brain to handle and then they ll get that frontal headache and pain behind the eyes.  Oen-Hsiao said. High blood pressure resulting in a headache can be urgent issue. Tadwalkar said. If the pressure is high enough and sustained for long enough. it can lead to bursting of the blood vessels.  It s helpful to be plugged in with a physician. because you d want to know if your blood pressure is trending high so that way it can be addressed before something like this could happen.  Tadwalkar said. Shortness of breath is a symptom associated with many heart conditions.  There are so many conditions that we evaluate and treat that have shortness of breath as a primary characteristic. that from our perspective — as cardiologists — it is a pretty non-specific symptom. but it is an important one.  Tadwalkar said.Shortness of breath. especially with exertion. can be a sign that a person has high blood pressure. Oen-Hsiao said she sees many older women who experience shortness of breath when they exercise.  As soon as they start exercising. their blood pressure jumps from normal baseline to really high  and they develop breathlessness. Oen-Hsiao said. Sudden shortness of breath that worsens with exertion could also be a sign of a clot in the lungs. There may be an issue with one of the heart valves. heart rhythm disturbances or even heart failure. If the shortness of breath is sudden and severe or if it s progressively getting worse. you ll want to get checked out by a heart doctor. Tadwalkar said. Nausea and a loss of appetite can be signs of heart failure. When the heart begins to fail. fluid can accumulate in the legs and belly. When the gut fills with fluid. it doesn t absorb nutrients as well. causing people to lose their appetite and feel full all of the time. Oen-Hsiao said.Occasionally. nausea and upset stomach are the only symptoms that patients with a blockage in the back artery of the heart will feel.  A lot of patients who have a heart attack with the artery in the back part of the heart. they actually won t have chest pain or shortness of breath. they ll just get really nauseous and feel sick to their stomach.  Oen-Hsiao said. Some people with cardiovascular issues will experience jaw pain and heaviness that radiates up the neck. into the jaw and down into the left arm. This is more common when patients are exerting themselves. Oen-Hsiao said these symptoms can be a sign of a heart attack. but they may also be a sign of angina (significant blockages). People experiencing neck and jaw pain should immediately be evaluated by a doctor.  The constellation of jaw discomfort and nausea — especially with ill-defined chest discomfort — even though it may not seem initially cardiac in nature. would be something that should bring somebody to an emergency department more urgently.  Tadwalkar said. ,Health News
AmazonThe service. called Amazon Care. will end by Dec. 31. according to an email sent to staff by Neil Lindsay. senior vice president of Amazon Health Services.Amazon Care was launched in 2019 for Seattle-based Amazon s Washington state employees. who served as trial users before the company made it available last year to its workers in all 50 states.The service connects patients virtually with doctors and nurses who can provide treatment 24 hours a day. It does not have physical locations. but offers in-person services for things like vaccinations and flu testing in several cities. including Seattle and Washington. D.C.to private employers nationwideIn the email sent to staff. Lindsay wrote that Amazon listened to feedback from employers and worked to improve Amazon Care. However. despite these efforts. we ve determined that Amazon Care isn t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers.  Lindsay wrote.He added that Amazon Care  is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting. and wasn t going to work long-term. An Amazon spokesperson declined to say how many people will lose their jobs because of the shutdown of Amazon Care.a short-lived collaborationannounced plansNeil Saunders. managing director at GlobalData Retail. said given that Amazon is now investing in other areas of health. it is taking a more aggressive stance on exiting things that are not delivering results. The closure underlines how hard making inroads into the health market is.  Saunders said.  It serves as a warning that even with acquisitions. Amazon s bid to shake up the sector will be incredibly difficult and possibly expensive. ,Health News
Trigger bans went into effect in Idaho. Tennessee and Texas overnight on Thursday. bringing the number of states where abortion has become illegal or been severely restricted to 14 since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. WadeSo-called trigger bans are state laws that were created to automatically ban abortion if Roe fell at the federal level. Many such bans. including in Kentucky. Louisiana and South Dakota. automatically went into effect as soon as Roe was repealed in late June. Others required 30 days or further certification from the state s attorney general before they could go into effect.Abortion was already outlawed after the six-week point in Tennessee and Idaho. and Texas had a pre-Roe ban in effect with no exceptions for rape or incest. Laws in each state required a specific amount of time to pass after the repeal of Roe for the trigger bans to take effect.Now. abortion is completely banned at any point in pregnancy in Tennessee with vague exceptions for the life or health of the pregnant person. In Idaho. a near-total abortion ban is also in effect. carrying a punishment of up to five years in prison for any physician who performs an abortion outside of the law s narrow exceptions. The Texas trigger law doesn t change who can seek an abortion in the state. but it further criminalizes abortion by threatening physicians who perform the procedure with life in prison and a $100.000 fine. There are no abortion exceptions for rape or incest in Tennessee or Texas. Idaho s trigger ban does include exceptions for rape or incest. but it requires victims to report the crime to law enforcement before obtaining a legal abortion. Idaho s law also has exceptions if the pregnant person s life or health is at risk. Today marks the latest attack against the fundamental rights of Americans as new abortion bans go into effect in Idaho. Oklahoma. Tennessee and Texas.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a Friday statement.Oklahoma is set to enact another near-total abortion ban on Saturday. Although the restriction is not a trigger law. it was passed last year and adds harsher criminal penalties and fines for physicians who perform abortions. Abortion is currently banned at any point in pregnancy in Oklahoma. with narrow exceptions for the life of the pregnant person.  These near-total abortion bans are part of a growing effort by Republican legislators to roll back the freedoms Americans have relied on for nearly half a century.  Jean-Pierre added.  Americans need to know that these and other fundamental rights. including the right to contraception and marriage equality. are at risk. sued the state of IdahoEmergency Medical Treatment and Labor Actruled late Wednesday Today. millions more people lost abortion access across the nation as bans went into effect in Texas. Tennessee and Idaho. Vast swaths of the nation. especially in the South and Midwest. are now abortion deserts that. for many. will be impossible to escape.  Nancy Northup. president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. said in a statement.  Evidence is already mounting of women being turned away despite needing urgent. and in some cases life-saving. medical care.  Northup added.  This unfolding public health crisis will only continue to get worse. We will see more and more of these harrowing situations. and once state legislatures reconvene in January. we will see even more states implement abortion bans and novel laws criminalizing abortion providers. pregnant people. and those who help them.  Just over two months after the Supreme Court s historic decision to repeal Roe. 14 states have laws in effect that criminalize most or all abortions. This means that around 21 million girls and women of reproductive age in the U.S. no longer have abortion care access in their home state. according to Census data. And that number doesn t include many transgender. nonbinary and genderqueer people who are able to get pregnant and will also no longer have access to these services.a judge temporarily blockedIndiana s near-total abortion ban — the first anti-choice legislation to pass since Roe s demise — will take effect on Sept. 15. And an anti-abortion measure in Arizona is set to go into effect on Sept. 24. but the state attorney general requested the courts consider an even stricter ban. ,Health News
The compound in psychedelic mushrooms helped heavy drinkers cut back or quit entirely in the most rigorous test of psilocybin for alcoholism.More research is needed to see if the effect lasts and whether it works in a larger study. Many who took a dummy drug instead of psilocybin also succeeded in drinking less. likely because all study participants were highly motivated and received talk therapy.are exploringease depressionallow its supervised usenew researchIn the study. 93 patients took a capsule containing psilocybin or a dummy medicine. lay on a couch. their eyes covered. and listened to recorded music through headphones. They received two such sessions. one month apart. and 12 sessions of talk therapy.During the eight months after their first dosing session. patients taking psilocybin did better than the other group. drinking heavily on about 1 in 10 days on average vs. about 1 in 4 days for the dummy pill group. Almost half who took psilocybin stopped drinking entirely compared with 24% of the control group.Only three conventional drugs — disulfiram. naltrexone and acamprosate — are approved to treat alcohol use disorder and there's been no new drug approvals in nearly 20 years.While it s not known exactly how psilocybin works in the brain. researchers believe it increases connections and. at least temporarily. changes the way the brain organizes itself. More parts of the brain are talking to more parts of the brain.  said Dr. Michael Bogenschutz. director of the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine. who led the research.Less is known about how enduring those new connections might be. In theory. combined with talk therapy. people might be able to break bad habits and adopt new attitudes more easily. There s a possibility of really shifting in a relatively permanent way the functional organization of the brain.  Bogenschutz said. Patients described life-changing insights that gave them lasting inspiration. Bogenschutz said.Mary Beth Orr. 69. of Burien. Washington. said her psilocybin-induced hallucinations — flying over breathtaking landscapes and merging telepathically with creative people throughout history — taught her she wasn't alone. Before enrolling in the study in 2018. Orr had five or six drinks every evening and more on weekends.  The quantity was unacceptable and yet I couldn t stop.  she said.  There was no off switch that I could access. During her first psilocybin experience. she saw a vision of her late father. who gave her a pair of eagle eyes and said.  Go.  She told the therapists monitoring her:  These eagle eyes can t see God s face. but they know where it is.  She stopped drinking entirely for two years. and now has an occasional glass of wine. More than the talk therapy. she credits psilocybin. It made alcohol irrelevant and uninteresting to me.  Orr said. Now.  I am tethered to my children and my loved ones in a way that just precludes the desire to be alone with alcohol. Patients receiving psilocybin had more headaches. nausea and anxiety than those getting the dummy drug. One person reported thoughts of suicide during a psilocybin session.In an experiment like this. it's important that patients don't know or guess if they got the psilocybin or the dummy drug. To try to achieve this. the researchers chose a generic antihistamine with some psychoactive effects as the placebo.Still. most patients in the study correctly guessed whether they got the psilocybin or the dummy pill.Paul Mavis couldn't guess. The 61-year-old from Wilton. Connecticut. got the placebo. but still quit drinking. For one thing. the talk therapy helped. suggesting to him that his emotional life stalled at age 15 when he started drinking to feel numb.And he described a life-changing moment during a session where he was taking the dummy drug: He imagined the death of a loved one. Suddenly. an intense. incapacitating grief overcame him. I was crying. which isn t typical for me. I was sweating. I was bereft.  he said.  As I m trying to reconcile this grief. like. why am I feeling this? Instantly. I thought. ‘Drinking equals death.   He said he hasn t had a drink since.Dr. Mark Willenbring. former director of treatment research at the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. said more research is needed before psilocybin can be considered an effective addition to talk therapy. He noted that talking with a therapist helped both groups — those who got psilocybin and those who didn t — and the added benefit of psilocybin appeared to wear off over time. It s tantalizing. absolutely.  Willenbring said.  Is more research required? Yes. Is it ready for prime time? No.  ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

I joined TikTok in 2020. but I don t consider myself a  content creator.  So. earlier this month. when one of my TikTok videos racked up over 1 million views in a matter of days. I was unprepared. Though I thought about taking it down. deleting my social media. or disappearing back into anonymity with a private account. something in my story was resonating with people. so I left it up.Even more difficult was that the video millions of strangers were watching was a vulnerable one. I made it in response to another TikToker. Danievanier. who d asked people to share the wildest way they d ever been fat-shamed. As soon as I heard the prompt. a single story came to mind. about a waiter who joked that I was going to eat my dining companion s food. and then eatmy companion. while we sat for lunch at his restaurant. Later. when I relayed the story to a friend. she refused to believe me. She insisted that I must have just misinterpreted the man s meaning. that I was too sensitive. Only when my dining companion confirmed my story did my friend change her mind.My video slowly found its way to sympathetic accounts. With its popularity ramping up. comments rolled in by the thousands. As I read through each one. I noticed a pattern — one that mimicked my real-life relationships in a surprising way.Most of the comments were supportive. expressing outrage at what the waiter said and even more at the friend who doubted me. I thought the waiter was bad. Turns out the ‘friend  was worse!  one said. The friend who didn t believe you is no friend.  another weighed in.  I hope you cut her out of your life.  Over and over. commenters named my friend as the real villain of the story and prayed I never spoke to her again.The flush of embarrassment lit my cheeks as I read through these comments because that s not what ended up happening. In fact. she did the same things several more times over the course of our friendship. and I said nothing. Once. I ran into her after hearing a group of teenage boys on the train talking about sexually harassing a plus-size female classmate. In the middle of a bout of laughter. they noticed me sitting nearby. They turned their conversation to fat women in general. and how they should be treated during sex. Every once in a while. they d glance my way and one would grab his crotch. or make some other lewd gesture. I tried to block them out with my headphones. but their oinking was louder than my music. By the time I left the train and met my friend. I was shaking. I m sure you just misheard them.  this friend said when I told her.  You ve been really stressed lately. Unfortunately. her reaction wasn t unique. When my sociology professor taught a lesson on the impact of social networks on identity. he closed his talk by reminding us that  If you don t want to become fat. don t be friends with fat people!  When I repeated his words to some classmates who weren t there. they were sure I must have misunderstood him or taken it the wrong way. Even when I showed them a copy of the study he was referencing and a photo of the slideshow from class. they still doubted it. You must have missed some subtext or something. He probably meant to point out how ridiculous the study was. and you didn t hear that part.  They looked at each other. knowingly — his meaning would have been clear to them. I only took it badly because. well … you know.I tried to be understanding of their responses. They were new friends. and we didn t know each other that well yet. They were trying to console me. to assure me that nobody thought badly of me because I was fat. But their denial didn t reassure me. Instead. it made me feel like a liar. or worse — like I was hallucinating.I was sure that at least part of their response was my fault. either because they were right and I was imagining things. or because I never addressed how much their reactions hurt me. They couldn t read my mind. But I feared that if I did tell them how it felt. they d just wait until I left the room to call me paranoid. At least now. they were saying it to my face.invitesShe must be right. andWhat I didn t recognize at the time was that all of these friends and the therapist had something in common: They were thin. Nothing like my interaction with this waiter had ever happened to them.This doubt about the truth of my shaming wound through my comments section. just as it wound through my real life. This is such [a] made up story. [it s] so pathetic it s sad.  one commenter declared.In response. dozens of people came to my defense. sharing their own stories of being fat-shamed. One person was mooed at by strangers in line at McDonald s. Another remembered the time a waiter put every family member s dinner plate in front of her mother as a joke. A third said a maintenance man doing work on her house told her she was fat because the devil was punishing her for her sins. Yet another overheard a parent tell their child to be careful she didn t eat them. On and on they went. telling stories just like mine.Interspersed between these comments. cowardly people hiding behind private profiles doubled down on the waiter s insults:You deserved it.That s hilarious – fat people are gross.You clearly didn t learn anything from it since you re still fat.And yet. just a few lines later. another commenter would accuse me. again. of lying.  None of this happened.  they said.The pattern was impossible to miss: outrage. shared experiences. disbelief. insult. Rinse and repeat.Some insisted that servers who lived on tips would never threaten their livelihoods by treating customers so badly. When I informed them that this happened in Europe. where weight shaming is more common and tipping is less. it didn t change their minds. Even when people outside the U.S. confirmed that this happens all the time in their home cities. doubters still ignored it. They couldn t imagine any world in which this happens. because it doesn t happen to them.They d never been fat. If they had. they wouldn t have found it hard to believe.In her book  What We Don t Talk About When We Talk About Fat.  author Aubrey Gordon dubs this public abuse  fatcalling and draws clear comparisons to the sexualized street harassment many women and LGBTQ people experience. She points out that just as straight. cis men often respond to stories of catcalling with disbelief. thin people of all genders deny the existence of fatcalling in a similar way. To them. receiving unsolicited commentary from strangers on their bodies. food choices and desirability every day is unimaginable.My comments section confirmed this: It didn t matter how much evidence they were given. it was almost as if thin people needed to believe that I was making this up. They had to know. beyond a doubt. that strangers were kind to them because they deserved it. rather than because of what their bodies looked like. I m much more selective about who I call a friend these days and what kind of treatment I ll tolerate from them. But next time you hear what seems like an extreme story about harassment. I would encourage those of you who are thin to believe it without needing to understand it. And especially to stop gaslighting the fat people in your lives. We are not imagining anti-fatness. we are living it. And denying the existence of hatred doesn t make it go away. it enables it.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

I don t know about you. but I keep seeing social media posts about antidepressants increasing the risk of heat stroke. In medication commercials. you hear a long list of side effects. but so many seem rare. Is this something we need to be worried about?As a proud user of Prozac. I figured this was worth checking out. so I spoke with experts about whether antidepressants really cause issues with heat during the summer months. The short answer? Yes.Basically. antidepressants can affect your body s ability to regulate your temperature and can contribute to dehydration which can lead to a heat stroke.  Antidepressants can impair the temperature regulation area of the brain. i.e.. hypothalamus.  said Dr. Markus Ploesser. a psychiatrist and chief innovation officer at Open Mind Health.  They can also increase sweating. thus contributing to dehydration. Your body may also lose water as your sodium levels decrease because of the medication.  Certain antidepressants — most notably mood-stabilizing antidepressants used to treat bipolar depression — can cause lower sodium levels. making the body lose more water and increase dehydration.  Ploesser added.In the summer months. you re probably already feeling hot and dehydrated. which doesn t combine well with those side effects. And if you become dehydrated and can t sweat enough or drink enough water. your temperature rises. which can lead to a heat stroke.Signs of a heat stroke include having a temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit. dry skin. not sweating. a rapid pulse. a headache. nausea. dizziness. confusion and unconsciousness. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Some professionals lean more toward one kind of antidepressant than another — so it s probably safe to say most or all of them carry some risks.SingleCareReema Hammoud.clinical pharmacist at Sedgwick. believes there s a riskier type. though.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. such as sertraline and paroxetine. can cause hyperhidrosis and stroke. but the risk is a lot lower compared to older agents such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).  Hammoud said. She explained  hyperhidrosis  is the fancy word for  excessive sweating.  Some examples of TCAs include Pamelor. Elavil and Anafranil.Ploesser agreed. adding other medication types that cause concern. too.  Medications which increase norepinephrine brain levels are also at an increased risk. e.g.. Effexor. Wellbutrin. Lithium and some antipsychotic medications used to treat depression also have an elevated risk.  he said.As with most or all health conditions and side effects. some people are more susceptible than others. So. let s be real: Is a heat stroke likely? Who needs to be most aware of this potential side effect?To start. older folks.  While everyone needs to be careful to avoid dehydration and heat stroke. the risks are relatively higher among older adults as they often metabolize and excrete medications at slower rates.  Ploesser said.  Older adults. in general. are also more likely to be on a greater number of medications for their physical and mental health concerns. and polypharmacy is also a significant risk factor. Gandhi said blood pressure medications are one type that can cause particularly high risks. She added being outside in the sun and heat doesn t help. either.  Depending on your treatment. it may be best to avoid being outside in high heat altogether. and it s worth consulting your doctor.  she said.Additionally. consider other side effects you re experiencing.  There is research that suggests about 20% of those taking antidepressants experience excessive sweating as a side effect.  Gandhi said.  So for those people. the risk of heat stroke is even higher. and therefore. they should take extra precautions when considering being outside in high temperatures. Hammoud shared a 2020 study that found 22% of participants taking antidepressants experienced a sudden heat stroke related to hormone dysregulation. However. it s not quite that simple or something to be overly concerned about. per se.  Although several observational studies suggest that SSRIs are associated with new onset stroke. many randomized trials indicate that SSRIs are beneficial for patients who have suffered a stroke.  Hammoud said.  Most evidence suggests that SSRIs do not increase the risk of death in patients with strokes. The best ways to protect yourself from a heat stroke are pretty straightforward. Ploesser recommended drinking more water (check out these helpful hacks for doing so!). limiting drinks that worsen dehydration (such as caffeine and alcohol). avoiding the heat and sticking to the shade when possible.Gandhi said even if you don t feel thirsty. drinking water is crucial. She suggested talking to your doctor about the best course of action. whether or not that includes some adjustments.  For psychiatric medications. including antidepressants. the dosage is very important and it can take some trial and error between patient and doctor to find the right dose.  she said.  So. it s important to talk to your doctor when you know you re going on vacation or plan to be in the sun for prolonged periods of time. Your doctor might advise limiting or avoiding sun exposure rather than adjusting the dosages of your medication. You can also make simple changes like eating cold foods with high fluid content (such as certain fruits and vegetables. or a salad) and wearing loose. lightweight clothes. Hammoud advised. And if you like to exercise outside. consider  exercise snacking.  aka shorter and more frequent workouts. so you don t get too hot at once.While the fact that antidepressants can have serious side effects. such as heat strokes. can be a huge bummer at best. doing what you need to do for your mental health is important. too. Set yourself up by drinking water. staying in the shade and checking in with your doctor.,Health News
Between the full-bodied flavor. aromatic scent and convenient brewing process. it s no surprise that French press coffee is popular. Even the brewing process itself is an act of mindfulness that levels up the morning coffee experience long before the first sip. But could it actually be raising your cholesterol?The how-tos of French press can get particular when it comes to ratios and water temperatures. but essentially the process goes something like this: Add ground coffee beans to your French press container. pour in hot water. let it steep. and plunge the metal filter down to strain out the grounds. Pour your coffee. and that s it. If you re wondering how this process could possibly raise your cholesterol. let s get into it. Without the use of paper filters. a mesh filter plunger is used to press the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pitcher and the remaining liquid is poured and consumed.  Emma Laing. director of dietetics at the University of Georgia and national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. told HuffPost.  This is what gives the finished product that bold flavor. The catch? Research suggests that unfiltered coffee can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels — the waxy. fat-like substance that can cause plaque buildup in your arteries. Here s how:Coffee itself isn t a source of dietary cholesterol — the oily materials released from the beans during steeping. known as diterpenes. have been linked to elevated blood cholesterol when consumed in larger quantities (six cups or more per day. according to a 2022 review published in the cardiology journal Open Heart).Paper coffee filters used in other brewing methods typically catch diterpenes and prevent them from ending up in your coffee. Because French press coffee is unfiltered. it contains significantly more diterpenes than traditionally filtered or instant coffees. The concentration of cafestol. a type of diterpene. in French press coffee is about 300 times greater than paper filtered drip coffee.  said Robert Fishberg. a New Jersey-based board-certified cardiologist with Atlantic Health System.Decaffeination and levels of roasting have little effect on diterpene concentrations.  In general. the higher the temperature and the longer the coffee grounds are steeped in water without filtration. the more oils are released into the finished brew.  Laing said.The actual mechanism behind why diterpenes raise cholesterol is unclear. One possibility is that it can raise levels of cholesterol ester transfer protein. known as CTEP. Fishberg said. which influences how the body metabolizes cholesterol. Lower CTEP levels promote HDL (good) cholesterol formation. while higher levels can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol production.Diterpenes may also affect two nuclear receptors (a class of proteins found in cells). called FXR and PXR. that play a role in keeping cholesterol levels balanced.Much more research needs to be done. though.  It s important to note that all of the studies looking at the French press had relatively small sample sizes and only documented the higher cholesterol levels.  Fishberg said. And the higher cholesterol levels were indicated after drinking quite a bit of French press coffee — anywhere from five to nine cups daily. or more.There were no outcome studies. either. meaning the studies show correlations. but cannot prove cause and effect or define interventions addressing the issue. There are important considerations when evaluating results from the French press coffee and cholesterol studies.  Laing said.  These include variations in the coffee itself (diterpene levels vary based on coffee species. roasting degree. particle size of the ground coffee beans. brew method and serving size). the health and demographics of the people studied. what they choose to add to their coffee and use of medications — those that lower or raise blood cholesterol are of particular importance. Though diterpenes have been linked to higher levels of cholesterol in the blood. studies have also shown their potential as having anti-inflammatory. anti-cancer and anti-diabetic effects.  More research is needed to prove these effects. but it s likely that diterpenes and other compounds in coffee have multiple health effects that occur simultaneously.  Laing said.This depends on how much French press coffee you drink on a daily basis and what you add to it. if anything. to enhance its flavor. For many individuals. enjoying coffee as part of an overall balanced eating pattern shouldn t raise cholesterol. nor should it raise a health concern.  Laing said.  If you add cream. half-and-half. butter or coconut oil to your cup though. be mindful that these ingredients contain saturated fat. which can also impact LDL cholesterol levels. Fishberg recommends switching to a dark roast. which has a lower concentration of diterpenes. Also. consider limiting the number of cups of French press coffee a day or alternating with drip coffee.The Food and Drug Administration recommends adults limit their caffeine intake to 400 mg per day. or roughly four cups of coffee.  There are no published guidelines to date on the amount of filtered versus unfiltered coffee that will prevent health issues. so the safest amount of French press coffee depends highly on the individual.  Laing said.Drinking one to four cups per day of French press coffee generally shouldn t have negative health effects. Laing explained. However. those who are sensitive to caffeine. have a heart condition. are pregnant or take medications known to alter blood cholesterol should consume less.And if your otherwise normal LDL cholesterol levels are suddenly high after a checkup. then curbing your French press coffee intake may be recommended by your health care provider. in addition to other lifestyle changes. Having your blood cholesterol levels checked regularly will help your health care provider determine if changes need to be made to your dietary or activity patterns and if there s a need for medications.  Laing said.French press aficionados not willing to alter their coffee habits can look to other ways to support healthy blood cholesterol levels. such as ensuring your plates are filled with fruits and veggies. whole grains. lean meats and healthy fats. as well as making sure you re exercising regularly.

Researchers at Columbia University Fertility Center. with funding from the National Institutes of Health. have developed a new test that can detect chromosomal abnormalities in an embryo or fetus much quicker than currently available technology. and at a fraction of the cost. The test. known as STORK (Short-read Transpore Rapid Karyotyping). could impact treatment for patients who have miscarried. are pregnant or are undergoing IVF. Zev WilliamsLike currently available tests. STORK identifies aneuploidies — or chromosomal additions or deletions — that are  by far. the most common cause of miscarriage and major cause of developmental delays and congenital anomalies.  said Williams. The test also indicates the sex of the embryo or fetus. Examples of aneuploidies include trisomy 13. or Patau syndrome. which affects multiple organ systems and is usually fatal before a child turns 1. and trisomy 18. or Edwards syndrome. which often results in miscarriage or stillbirth. Trisomy 21. or Down syndrome. is the best-known of these conditions. but one of the least severe. While Trisomy 21 makes miscarriage and stillbirth much more likely. it s also possible for people with Down syndrome to live well into adulthood.Note that while STORK and other karyotyping tests detect aneuploidies. they do not detect monogenic diseases that result from a mutation of one gene. Testing for these diseases. such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. would require an additional test. The technology used by the STORK test analyzes DNA samples at 15.000 times the speed of current methods. delivering results in under two hours. Current tests. which involve sending samples to a laboratory. require days or weeks of waiting for results. In their testing. researchers examined 218 samples from embryo biopsies. miscarriages and pregnancies. STORK s results matched the results of standard testing in all pregnancy samples and in 98% of embryo samples. The two tests did not have matching results for 10 miscarriage samples. but researchers later determined that the STORK results were accurate. The STORK test involves a compact device that fits in the palm of a hand and can process up to 10 samples at a time. further reducing costs. The study team estimates that it will cost $200 to run one sample. but only $50 if 10 samples are run at a time. Current standard tests can cost thousands of dollars. and insurance companies often won t cover genetic testing for a miscarriage if it s the patient s first. Williams and his colleagues are currently waiting for approval from the New York State Department of Health in order to begin offering the test to Columbia patients. success ratesIn terms of pregnancy care. patients who have amniocentesis after 15 weeks or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10-13 weeks would receive test results much more quickly. But the ability to act on those results would depend on where they live.Donna GregoryAbortions in those states are now unavailable to patients who have been pregnant long enough to get tests like amniocentesis or CVS. even if the test results come back rapidly. But in a state like Florida. which currently bans abortion after 15 weeks. the speed of STORK testing could prove significant. The test also relieves the psychological burden of awaiting results. Women and families waiting for the results of these tests when they are done based on suspicion and concern for the fetus experience a large amount of emotional stress.  said Gregory.  Having the ability to test in-office can alleviate this.  STORK s low cost could make genetic testing after miscarriage much more widely available. It also simplifies the process. Currently. labs have to grow cells from a miscarriage. a task that can take weeks and is not always successful — sometimes leaving patients without answers. Hugh Taylor The test will allow a rapid and inexpensive way to determine if this is the cause or if we need to look for other reason for the loss.  said Taylor. The Trying GameKlein is hopeful that greater access to testing will help people who lose a pregnancy make decisions moving forward.  Women who suffer multiple miscarriages are severely undertreated.  she said.  If the pregnancy loss was found to be genetically abnormal. that provides a sense of closure. ameliorates feelings of self-blame and guilt. and provides reassurance for her next pregnancy.  Williams added.While the test can t deliver any information that isn t currently available. its speed alone makes it noteworthy. I think there is something very encouraging about using the most advanced technologies to address fertility and pregnancy loss — two of the most ancient of human afflictions.  said Williams. There is a trend towards rapid self-testing as we have seen during COVID.  said Taylor.  Many tests that were traditionally performed only in laboratories are now conducted at home or in a physician s office.   This particular test is far more complex than most simple home tests.  Taylor continued.  The successful development of a rapid and inexpensive option demonstrates that even very complex genetic tests can be simplified through clever use of modern technology to improve patient care.  ,Health News

The changes are public. energizing activism by both opponents and supporters of abortion rights. but they re also intimate.Ohio State University said the ruling doesn t change the services provided by its Student Health Services or its medical center. noting Ohio already prohibited state institutions from performing elective abortions.

I was recently on a vacation with a friend that involved a great deal of walking around a new city. During a moment of respite. I noticed she dropped into a deep squatting position. rather than plopping down on a nearby bench like I did. When I asked why she wasn t sitting. she joked.  I m trying out the Slav squat. The pervasive  Squatting Slav  or  Slav Squat  meme Asian Squat But in the U.S.. squatting is considerably less common (such that in my informal poll of friends. only about half were even able to assume this position without holding onto something). Bahram JamBut should we be hanging out in a deep squat for prolonged periods of time? What s the optimal approach to the squat? Below. Jam and other experts break it down. Bryan AusinheilerMaintaining a deep squat resting position with heels on the ground requires a good amount of balance. Justin C. LinRehab and Revive Pain and Wellness CenterThis balance game. as Lin called it. targets multiple muscle groups. stretching your back. hips. knees and ankles.  The ankles. knees. hips and back move into their full rage of flexion. loading the joint and the cartilage which is necessary for maintaining good cartilage health.  Jam said. For some people. getting into a deep squat position with their heels on the ground is difficult or may even feel impossible. This is often the result of compromised ankle dorsiflexion ― basically the ability to bend your ankle and move your foot toward your shin.  Full ankle dorsiflexion is needed to keep the heels down during a squat.  Jam explained.  If people have stiff ankles either due to genetics or due to an old ankle injury. keeping the heels down will not be possible. The modification is to simply hold on to a doorway or a bar and go into a deep squat. Ausinheiler noted that 45 degrees is the optimal ankle range of motion for achieving a deep squat and that people with less than 35 degrees will likely struggle to get into the position.  When my babies were born. I measured their range of motion at about 75 degrees.  he explained.  That s why it s so easy for toddlers to squat. They have the body proportions of a chimp. so their shins might even be totally vertical. As children grow. their body proportions change. and their limbs get longer. Squatting thus becomes more difficult. Short people have proportionally shorter limbs in general. so squatting will be easier for them.  Ausinheiler explained.  The people who break world records in squatting are usually short. Many kids don t use their full range of ankle motion. so it decreases over time. Ausinheiler believes children should be encouraged to squat more to help maintain a 45-degree range of motion.  The range you use as a child will determine your capacity to squat. even more so than your height.  he explained.  I think kids shouldn t be using chairs and desks at school until second grade. We should have them on the floor more to maintain that range of motion.  All movements that are within the capability of the human body are good for us. so squatting is technically of course good for the body.  Jam said.  But holding any posture or position for a prolonged period of time is not good. as it will irritate certain parts of the body. If you turn your neck to the right or left all the way to the available range of rotation. that s great for keeping your neck healthy and functioning. he explained. But turning your neck all the way and then holding it there for 30 minutes will inevitably cause discomfort as you try to move it back to the center.  The same goes for maintaining healthy ankles. knees. hips and back.  Jam noted.  By squatting we move them through their full available ranges. Remaining in a squat position for a prolonged period of time is also not particularly practical.Matthew Stults-KolehmainenThere are potential downsides to prolonged squatting as well. Ausinheiler noted that hockey goalies squat for extended periods and tend to develop hip issues ― though their knee positioning likely contributes to that as well.  In a deep squat. you re creating impingement in the hip.  he said.  The hip joint is pinching the front of the labrum. But. as with most things in life. different people respond differently. more prone to adverse health effectsto a studya later study I don t necessarily think we should spend more time hanging in a deep squat. certainly not more than sitting in a chair or standing. but it s a good movement to be able to do. a good capacity to have.  Ausinheiler said.  Full bandwidth of movement is something we should work on so that we can do things like put items in an overhead compartment or reach things on our toes. He noted that there might be times in your life when you ll need to use a squatting toilet. pick something up from the ground or squat down with a small child. Just like anything. there s balance.  Lin said.  If you want to be in a stationary squatting position for 15-20 minutes a day as part of your routine. I think that s great ― it helps with your balance. joint mobility. muscles and pelvic floor. My friends and I might hang out and squat like that as we drink our boba. but then we get up and move around. We aren t necessarily doing it all day as we work on a laptop for instance. Maintaining a good range of motion and mobility is all about implementing a variety of postures and movements into your everyday life.  Squatting is a self test of how healthy your lower extremities and your back is.  Jam said.  To maintain that health. I think we all should squat every day at least once. even if it is for a few seconds. After all. the rule is use it or lose it. If you re concerned you ve lost your ability to deep squat. it s possible to get at least a little bit of it back.  There are exercises. mobility type movements that increase joint range.  Lin said.  You can build ankle. hip. knee and pelvis ability and awareness. Ausinheiler said he believes it s possible to get back up to 5 degrees of ankle range of motion. though the process might be challenging.  If someone has pain and is unable to do a deep squat. they should consult a physical therapist who can figure out the reasons for the limitation and help them achieve that goal.  Jam said.  My patients gain so much self-confidence when they are finally able to squat. even if it is by holding on to something and get up again. Although deep squatting can be a great tool in your bodily arsenal. that doesn t mean it s essential for everyone. so don t despair if it s just not happening for you.  Some people should not squat.  Stults-Kolehmainen said.  Always consult with a credentialed professional before doing unaccustomed exercise that might be putting inordinate stress on the body. For a majority of my patients. doing a sit to stand from a chair. 20-30 times. simulates a squat. This would develop fitness much better. He cautioned against the  false choice  between sitting or doing a deep squat.  If you want to minimize sitting. just stand up.  Stults-Kolehmainen said.  Get some ‘exercise snacks.  You don t need to do a fancy squat to break up sitting time. Simply stop sitting. ,Health News
Donald Trump In March of 2020. all of our data that I used to warn Americans of who was at risk for severe disease. hospitalization. and deaths came from our European colleagues.  Birx told CBS   Face the Nation.  That in itself should be an indictment of our system. Last week. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky announced a  reset  at the Atlanta-based agency. which has been heavily criticized for its lagging response to COVID and monkeypox.told Birx welcomed Walensky s announcements. calling this moment  an inflection point  for the CDC.Birx also called attention to failures in the CDC s system in 2020 for reporting COVID data from hospitals. Further. she said. the CDC used a  convenience data set  to issue guidance that people could return to work wearing a mask after five days of isolating following a COVID infection. Antigen tests would have revealed most Americans would still test positive up to 11 days into their infection. she noted. Recommendations that are created out of lack of transparency. and out of a black box where you can t really follow the logic is what leads to fracturing and trust.  Birx told CBS  Margaret Brennan.  And you really have to work to reestablish that. It can be done. but they have to change how they collect data. how they present data. and how they communicate to the American people. dropped its recommendationwarned Our health care system is going to get into serious trouble unless we are very proactive about preventing it.  Jha told at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Tuesday. adding that testing and treatment will play important roles this winter. On monkeypox. Birx said she found it troubling that the country did not learn from the mistakes of the COVID-19 pandemic. What was so disturbing to me about monkeypox is a lot of the issues that got us into the ditch with COVID were repeated.  Birx said.  Those mistakes were repeated with monkeypox: not adequate testing early on. not making tests available in every community that you knew was at risk.  She continued:  Just like what happened with COVID. lack of preparation. lack of engagement. lack of utilization of the tools that we had in real-time to prevent this 14.000. and probably it s well over 20.000 now.  ,Health News
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionkills tens of thousandsBelow. a vaccine expert shares when to get your flu shot this year and why it s important to get the jab.Yes. If COVID-19 has taught us anything. we now know just how important vaccination is to stop the spread of a virus. As we live through another pandemic fall. it s important to be as protected as possible against both COVID-19 and the flu.which is entirely possibleNational Hispanic Medical AssociationAdditionally. because we haven t been exposed to the flu virus as much in the last few years. our immune systems may not recognize it as well (especially without the shot).Not only does your flu shot protect you. but it shields those around you. While you may experience a mild case of the flu. that doesn t mean those around you will have the same luck.  People. unfortunately. [have] gotten used to saying it s just the flu.  Johansson said. but  influenza is a killer  and  tends to kill the young and the elderly.  along with people with diseases like asthma and COPD.So. while it s easy to say.  oh. I ve never gotten the flu vaccine and I m fine.  it s crucial to remember that by vaccinating yourself. you re reducing the risk that the flu will infect someone who may not be fine.really great studies People should get their influenza vaccine as soon as it s available in their community.  Johansson said.  That s usually in September. While we see the flu year-round. it increases in October and November. and then peaks in February. he explained. So. you ll want to make sure you re protected by the time cases begin to rise. which means getting a shot as early as you can so your body has time to build up immunity.Say you don t get it this second. Johansson then suggested that you aim for at least the end of October. But overall: Any time is a good time to get your flu shot rather than not getting it at all.While earlier in the season may be preferable.  if you have the opportunity to get it in December. get it.  Either way. you re adding to your community s flu protection and looking out for yourself. too.A new. omicron-targeting COVID booster that is now available to everyone ages 5 and up if they get the Pfizer shot or 6 and up if they get the Moderna dose.It s perfectly safe to get your flu shot at the same time as your new COVID booster. Johansson said.  You can get the shots together. one in each arm.  And if you are a person who is uneasy about needles or shots. it may actually be good to just have one appointment for both if that s more of a guarantee that you ll get them.So. talk to your doctor about getting your flu shot so you can have a plan before cases really begin to soar.,Health News

Dr. Alanna A. Morris is the Associate Professor of Medicine and the Director of Heart Failure Research at Emory University School of Medicine. and focuses on the impacts race and gender may have on health disparities in cardiovascular disease. She is part of a new educational initiative called Hear Your Heart. which is designed to speak directly to Black and Latina women living with heart failure and empower them to prioritize their care. We asked Dr. Morris to provide insight into managing heart failure and ways women can advocate for their health. Why is it important for Black women to think about their heart health?Black communities have higher rates of diabetes. obesity and high blood pressure which can lead to heart disease. including heart failure.¹ Black women. specifically. face many unique challenges and barriers that prevent optimal care and a variety of social determinants of health. such as socioeconomic barriers and environmental influences. which can contribute to poor health outcomes.² Education and access to the right resources can help improve disparities in care to ensure Black women are thinking about and addressing their heart health.In some cases. women may not feel heard by their physicians. What can women do to improve their experiences and have their concerns addressed by their doctors?It s important to share as much detail as possible with your doctor to make sure your concerns are being addressed. Go into appointments prepared with questions and any health updates including any side effects or changes. You may be taking multiple medications to help manage your heart failure. as well as any related conditions. such as chronic kidney disease or diabetes.³ It is important to keep track of these medications and monitor how they make you feel. Take notes or record a voice memo with your phone at your appointments to refer back to and share with other members of your care team — like family. friends. nutritionists. physical therapists. or other physicians — for reference. If you feel like you are not getting the best care possible. don t be afraid to seek a second opinion on a diagnosis or treatment plan. or request a referral to a specialist. Finding the right doctor can take time. but it s important to continue to advocate for yourself and your needs so you are receiving the best possible care. Managing heart failure can be complicated and overwhelming⁴ but women need to feel empowered to put themselves first and get the support they need.Speaking of concerns. when it comes to heart failure in particular. what are some symptoms women should be aware of? At which point should they seek a diagnosis for these symptoms?Diabetes. smoking. high blood pressure. high blood cholesterol. physical inactivity. obesity and family history of heart disease can all be risk factors for heart disease. which includes heart failure.¹Symptoms are different for everyone. but women with heart failure often present with shortness of breath. fatigue and weakness. swelling in the legs. ankles and feet. irregular heartbeat. rapid weight gain and swelling of the abdomen.⁵ It s important to go to your doctor as soon as you recognize these symptoms or if something does not feel right.⁵When it comes to diagnosing heart failure. what kind of information should patients have at the ready for their physicians?Women need to know their health history. including their personal history as well as their family history. Personal history would include any previous diagnoses like high blood pressure. diabetes. overweight and obesity or kidney disease.¹ Also knowing family history is critically important. If your mother. your aunt. your grandmother on your mother s side and your great-aunt all had heart disease. that increases the risk that you too may develop heart disease. Bringing this information to your appointments will allow your physician to understand the full picture of your health history to accurately make a diagnosis and work with you to develop a tailored treatment plan.How does education. or a better understanding of one s health condition. lead to better care? How can one become an engaged patient?Staying informed and taking an active role in managing overall health is critical to treating heart failure. Once you receive your diagnosis. it s important for you to do your own research on your condition and understand all the aspects that go into care and treatment. For example. your doctor will likely prescribe multiple medications to you. and it s important for you to understand what those medications are and why they re being prescribed.³Women with heart failure can be engaged in their care by coming prepared with questions and updates from their care team to all appointments and taking notes to be their best advocate. If you are struggling. connecting with a local advocacy group either virtually or in-person could provide support and advice to further understand your condition. Start by searching online to see what your options are. or ask around your community to see if there are any local efforts. It s never too late to change your heart failure journey.Once a patient is diagnosed with heart failure. what lifestyle changes should they make to manage their condition?Managing heart failure is complex and every journey is different.⁴ Lifestyle changes including healthy diet. exercise⁶ and managing mental health⁶ can help prevent and improve symptoms associated with the management of heart failure.In terms of diet. it s important to reduce the amount of salt. because when you eat a lot of salt. the body may retain that salt and fluid with it. and that can make the symptoms of shortness of breath and swelling worse.⁶.⁷ Physical activity is also an extremely important part of lifestyle modifications for people with heart failure. We want people to be active. to walk. to exercise. to use their heart because it is a muscle.⁶.⁸What is the importance of a support system while living with heart failure? How can a support system— friends. family. care providers — impact one s journey through the diagnosis?Having a strong support system while living with heart failure is essential to make sure you are prioritizing your health and are able to make the lifestyle changes required for managing your condition. You have to be able to ask for the help that you need so that you can feel your best despite your condition. Be honest with your care team on how they can best support you. This could mean helping with grocery shopping or cleaning your house. bringing you to or from doctor appointments and even working with you to manage your treatment and medications. Keeping everyone connected and aware of how you are feeling can help you actively manage your care and positively impact your heart failure outcomes.Can you speak more about how race and gender may contribute to health disparities in cardiovascular disease? How do those factors affect quality of care or even whether they receive care at all?Heart failure impacts more than six million people nationwide⁹. approximately half of which are women.¹⁰ Despite a similar prevalence of the chronic condition.¹¹ women diagnosed with heart failure have worse outcomes compared to men.¹² Although professional treatment guidelines show no difference in recommendations between men and women. diagnoses are often missed or delayed in women. and they are often not treated as aggressively by their healthcare providers as compared to men.¹¹A deeper look reveals that among Black and Latina women with heart failure. negative health outcomes are magnified due to significant health disparities and inequities that exist in the management of the condition.¹³.¹⁴.¹⁵ These factors lead to undertreatment and mismanagement of heart failure. That s why I joined Hear Your Heart — to help tackle the gaps in care that can lead to worse health outcomes for Black and Latina women living with this condition.Disparities. especially among Black and Latina women. may lead to mistrust with the medical system. What are the ways women can overcome this distrust and advocate for themselves at the doctor s office?Medical mistrust is a much greater issue for Black and Latina people in this country. particularly Black and Latina women. This medical mistrust is likely justified in many circumstances because of the historic injustices that have occurred in our communities.² Despite that. avoiding healthcare altogether will not result in a good outcome. There are doctors out there of all genders. races and ethnicities who will listen to you. who will engage in care and shared decision making with you. but you have to find that person. If you re seeing a doctor who you feel is not listening or engaging in the process of care with you. it is okay to leave that doctor and find another one.And finally. do you have any other tips or words of advice for women living with heart failure?Every heart failure journey is different and there isn t a  one-size fits all  approach to treatment. You ll have ups and downs in your treatment journey. but it s important that you remain consistent with your treatment plan and take the time to prioritize heart health by making lifestyle changes.⁶ ensuring associated medical and mental health conditions are managed and securing the right care team.¹⁶It s time to hear your heart. It s time to prioritize your heart health. Talk to your doctor today.

Aimee Layton—  s important not to ignore your body when it s signaling pain.  Layton said.  There s a reason pain receptors exist.  A little bit of soreness when you re building muscle — which is OK — is quite different from a sharp pain  that you should not push through.  she added.How exactly can you know the difference? Experts told HuffPost about the signs that indicate an injury after a workout and what to do about it.One red flag is swelling around a joint after a workout. according to Dr. Michael Fredericson. a sports medicine physician at Stanford Health Care.Any stiffness around joints in the knees. hips. ankles or lower back is also concerning. he said. while adding that sYou should take notice if joint or muscle stiffness is ever  impairing your ability to walk.  Fredericson said. If that s the case. you should get in touch with your doctor.fter the workout.  Layton said. Injuries. meanwhile. are much more immediate.  The pain from injury usually occurs during the workout  or directly afterward. she added.You may notice that a muscle hurts once you stop using it. for example. Cases in which you might immediately feel pain include making a misstep while running or overexerting your shoulder while lifting weights.No matter how much warming up or stretching you do. an injury won t get less painful. Layton said.—But when you are just dealing with soreness rather than an injury. a prolonged warmup will make the muscle feel better as you get it moving. Layton said.ecommendation is the RICE method  — or using rest. ice. compression and elevation — Fredericson said. To minimize any swelling in the first 24 to 48 hours. you will want to compress the injured area and elevate it above the level of your heart. This  can be helpful to drain the fluid.  Fredericson said.If you re well beyond the 48-hour mark or the RICE method hasn t alleviated the pain when you work out. you may need to see a doctor. Layton stressed. The RICE method is still helpful. but you can couple it with additional treatment from your doctor or a sports performance center. she added.You re probably well aware of the benefits of a good warmup and cooldown when exercising. A warmup gets your body ready for a workout. while a cooldown reduces your heart rate afterward.Both decrease the risk of injury and intense soreness after strenuous exercise. You should be warming your body up and cooling it down before and after every workout. Fredericson stressed. You don t want to just jump into vigorous exercise.  he said. Instead. start with easy movements like jogging or jumping rope. dynamic stretchingBut you shouldn t do static stretching before a workout. Fredericson said. Instead. save this for after you exercise.If you want to take your after-workout recovery to the next level. sports massages or deep-tissue massages can help. Fredericson said.foam rollerTheragun devices and similar tools can also help massage your sore muscles. he added. Everyone has a  biological envelope.  or the limit of activity that a person s body can handle. Fredericson said. Much of preventing injuries while promoting a healthy fitness routine relates to  getting to know your body and understanding what your body can tolerate.  he said.If your body can t accommodate a certain kind of exercise. it is more likely to cause joint swelling or deeper muscle soreness. he said.Most people instinctively know the difference between pain and soreness-related discomfort. Layton added. There is a level of discomfort when we re exercising that is normal.  she said. like running for that extra 15 seconds to build endurance or. sometimes. just committing to a day s workout. But pain is very different. and you shouldn t ignore it.,Health News
Experiencing chest pain is scary and shouldn t be ignored. At best. it s uncomfortable. at worst. it s a concerning warning sign. Chest pain is also fairly common: Non-traumatic chest pain is the second-most frequent cause of emergency department visits among adults. accounting for as many as 8 million visits a year. according to a 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine.With so many potential causes of chest pain (which we ll get into in a bit). how do you know what you re dealing with? Is it heart-related pain or something else? As someone who has struggled with chest pain on and off for years. with a few guesses at the culprit — anxiety. asthma. costochondritis — I know. to some degree. what that fear is like. I reached out to cardiologists for their input on what to look for. One thing to monitor is when the pain arises.  Chest discomfort that is heart-related is usually described as a chest discomfort that is worse with exertion.  said Dr. Estelle Jean. a cardiologist from MedStar Montgomery Medical Center in Olney. Maryland.  Patients typically describe the chest discomfort as tightness. pressure. heaviness. squeezing. a band-like sensation or heartburn.  She added the pain is usually gradual in both the onset and offset.If the chest pain is secondary to blockages of heart arteries. you may also notice other signs. For example. the pain  may radiate to the left arm. shoulder or jaw. and can be associated with other symptoms such as trouble breathing. lightheadedness. sweating or nausea and vomiting.  said Dr. Adriana Quinones-Camacho. a cardiologist and the chief of medicine at NYU Langone Health s Manhattan campus.Both Jean and Quinones-Camacho agreed that rest is crucial — along with talking to a doctor. of course.  Any chest pain symptoms should be taken very seriously and fully evaluated by a health care provider.  Quinones-Camacho said.Let s start with what chest pain that s not related to the heart usually looks like. Jean said it s  typically described as a sharp pain that is worse with deep breathing or coughing. pain localized with one finger. pain worse with movement or palpation. and fleeting pains lasting a few seconds or less. Many things can cause chest pain. but here are some of the common ones experts see:Acid refluxGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). or acid reflux. is when stomach acid comes back up your esophagus. (Yup. it s as bad as it sounds.) You may notice heartburn after eating. difficulty swallowing and coughing. Jean suggested treating GERD with antacids. such as Tums or Rolaids.AsthmaAsthma is a condition where your airways narrow and produce extra mucus. Signs include wheezing while exhaling. shortness of breath and coughing. If you have asthma. talk to your doctor about getting an inhaler if you don t already have one (and make sure you get a new one once your current one expires).AnxietyLike many mental illnesses. anxiety can cause physical issues. such as chest pain. Besides worrying. people with generalized anxiety disorder may also overthink. struggle with uncertainty and be unable to relax or concentrate. Both psychotherapy and anti-anxiety medication can help. Jean said. Strategies to reduce stress can include meditation. yoga. sleeping at least 7 to 8 hours at night. eating a heart-healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise.  she added. Heart-healthy foods that cardiologists eat include fruit. vegetables. lean meat and whole grains.Muscle strainSkipping warm-ups before exercising. contact injuries. lifting things while twisting your body and muscle fatigue can all cause muscle strain. Pay attention to any bruising. pain while breathing. swelling and difficulty moving. If you faint. get dizzy. vomit. have a fever. get sleepy or struggle to breathe after. go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise. Quinones-Camacho said the issue should resolve on its own.Among the other potential causes of chest pain are chest wall issues. stomach ulcers. a pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. Getting your doctor s input on your specific case is important. At the very least. consider calling a nurse support line. Insurance companies often offer this as part of their benefits.Remember: Chest pain can be life-threatening. even if it doesn t seem like it at first. Seeing a physician as soon as possible is vital.,Health News
ZOLOCHIV. Ukraine (AP) — Dr. Ilona Butova almost looks out of place in her neatly pressed lavender scrubs as she walks through a door frame that hangs from a crumbled wall into what used to be an administrative office of her hospital in Zolochiv.Not one building in the facility in the northeastern Ukrainian town near the Russian border has escaped getting hit by artillery shells.Russia s invasionUkraine s health care system struggled for years because of corruption. mismanagement and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the war has only made things worse. with facilities damaged or destroyed. medical staff relocating to safer places and many drugs unavailable or in short supply. Care is being provided in the hardest-hit areas by doctors who have refused to evacuate or have rushed in as volunteers. putting themselves at great risk. It s very hard. but people need us. We have to stay and help.  said Butova. a neurologist who also is the administrator of the hospital in the town near Kharkiv. Ukraine s second-largest city. She added that she has had to do more with fewer resources.The World Health Organization declared its highest level of emergency in Ukraine the day after the invasion. coordinating a major relief effort there and in neighboring countries whose medical systems also are under strain.About 6.4 million people have fled to other European countriesAcross Ukraine. 900 hospitals have been damaged and another 123 have been destroyed. said Health Minister Viktor Liashko. noting:  Those 123 are gone. and we re having to find new sites to build replacements. In addition. scores of pharmacies and ambulances have been destroyed or are seriously damaged. and at least 18 civilian medical staff have been killed and 59 others seriously wounded. he said. In occupied areas. the referral system has totally broken down.  Liashko told The Associated Press.  People s health and their lives are in danger. Kyiv s economy was drained by the conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014. When he came to power five years later. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy inherited a health care system that was undermined by reforms launched under his predecessor that had slashed government subsidies and closed many small-town hospitals. During the pandemic. people in those communities had to seek care in large cities — sometimes waiting as long as eight hours for an ambulance in severe cases of COVID-19.As Russia has expanded the territory it controls in eastern and southern Ukraine. the supply of drugs in those areas has dwindled. along with medical staff to administer them. In the southern front-line town of Mykolaiv.  things have been very difficult.  volunteer Andrii Skorokhod said. Pharmacies have not been working. and shortages have become increasingly acute: Hospital staff were among those evacuated. including specialists. We just need more staff.  said Skorokhod. who heads a Red Cross initiative to provide residents with free medications.Volunteers like Skorokhod saved the life of 79-year-old Vanda Banderovska. whose home near Mykolaiv was destroyed by Russian artillery. Her 53-year-old son. Roman. was killed. and she was brought to the hospital badly bruised and barely conscious. My son went out to the car to get his mobile phone when the Russians started shelling. He was hit in the head.  she said at a recovery ward. her voice trembling with emotion.  They ve destroyed everything and I have nothing left. Banderovska said she was deeply grateful to the people who saved her life but also overcome by grief and anger. The pain I feel is so great. When doctors took me to the hospital I was bruised black and blue but I slowly recovered.  she said.___Derek Gatopoulos reported from Kyiv.

If you ve never had an orgasm. it s easy to feel like your body is defective. But the reality is. there are many things that can contribute an inability to orgasm and plenty of ways to address it — it s not hopeless! Sadie AllisonTickleKittyPast trauma. subconscious feelings of shame or fear. body discomfort. anxiety or even just lack of knowledge about anatomy can also be factors in anorgasmia. One of the main reasons. however. is a lack in education around sexual anatomy. arousal and response. pleasure and the clitoris.  Allison added.  Unfortunately they don t teach this important information in school. But the good news is. this is something that can be practiced and learned with success! you are not alonewrong10% of womenKate BalestrieriModern IntimacyKeeley RankinInstead. start with your own body. by yourself. Explore which zones are your hot spots and get comfortable masturbating. Nazanin Moali Sexology She recommended building psychological arousal by reading or listening to sexually explicit or romantic content. whatever turns you on.  When you feel aroused. I recommend that you start with a body scan from head to toe and make a note of all the sensations in your body.  Moali said.Consider gently massaging lotion all over your body. Take deep breaths in and out to release any tension.  Start with touching and caressing your face and neck and explore different types of strokes.  she advised.  The goal for the first few times is to get to know different sensations in your body. Set the intention to get to know your body and explore it without putting any pressure. When you are ready. slowly move to your genital area and pay attention to the types of stroke that feel good. You can use your fingers or a vibrator or other sex toy in your exploration. Familiarize yourself with lots of different sensations. Megan FlemingRather than concentrating on having an orgasm. try to focus on the pleasure of arousal. connection with your body or your partner s body. creativity and general enjoyment.  Re-conceptualize your expectations for sex.  Balestrieri said.  So many people organize themselves around penetration and orgasm being the pinnacle and goal for pleasure. But that perpetuates a performative experience of sex and limits the countless other opportunities for pleasure that can increase the likelihood of an orgasm. Changing the goal from having an orgasm to experiencing pleasure and fun can paradoxically make orgasms more accessible.  Spectrum BoutiqueShe hopes society will continue to move away from penetrative intercourse as the standard definition of  sex  and seeks to educate people with vulvas and their partners about the importance of the clitoris ― the small erogenous organ with highly sensitive nerve endings ― in reaching orgasm.  Become cliterate.  echoed Allison.  If you re still learning where your clitoris is. or how to pleasure it. this is your starting point. The clitoris has about 8.000 nerve endings and is the main epicenter of orgasm creation. While there are other types of orgasms like G-spot. penetrative. anal. they are more advanced. so consider exploring those after you become your own clitoral expert. When it comes to sex with a partner. good communication is crucial. Everyone is different. so don t be shy in sharing how you like you like to be touched. Kimberly Resnick AndersonOf course. the conversation can be uncomfortable. especially with a new partner. but having an open dialogue will bring you closer.Jenni Skyler.Whatever you do. don t fake an orgasm. or stop doing it if you ve already developed that habit.  At times. women fake orgasms in an attempt to please their partner.  Moali said.  However. through this. you are also sending the wrong information to your partner about what works for you. Instead. focus on slowing down and getting curious about what types of touches feel good in your body. Spending more time engaging in foreplay will help you build enough arousal. thereby shortening the arousal gap between you and your partner. Never stop trying new things. from techniques to toys. Resnick Anderson suggested vocalizing as a tip to facilitate orgasm.  Research has shown that expressing sounds of pleasure during sex can increase capacity for orgasm.  she explained.  Women are also more likely to climax during coitus if they can control the speed. depth. and angle of penetration with positions like cowgirl or reverse cowgirl. Resnick Anderson also recommended trying different kinds of porn. like more female-friendly videos or erotic writing. Even something as simple as keeping your socks on might make you feel more comfortable and relaxed.  Activate as many senses as possible.  she added. noting that some people struggle to get out of their heads and into their bodies.  The more sensations one experiences at the same time. the easier it is to connect to your body. Tantalize your senses by engaging your hearing. vision. tastebuds. sense of smell. and sense of touch all at once. When our brains are busy listening. smelling. tasting. seeing. and touching. it s easier to ignore intrusive or anxious thoughts. Invest in a new vibrator or other sex toys for solo or partnered sex. Try a lubricant. And pay attention to the different kinds of sensory experiences that give you pleasure. or even turn you on.  Don t limit yourself to what you think should turn you on. and instead give yourself permission to explore a full range of fantasies or erotic material. so you can learn what your body responds to.  Balestrieri said.  Refrain from judging yourself. Fantasies are just fantasies and do not say anything about your character. Often. fantasies give us access to an emotional or sensory experience that we can t (and may not even want to) experience in real life. Think of fantasies and sex as play. and let yourself color with vibrance. If you re concerned about your inability to orgasm. you may also consider seeking professional help.Nicoletta HeideggerIf there are no discernible medical issues. she recommended then reaching out to a sex therapist. sex coach or sexological bodyworker to continue your journey. Come as You Are  Becoming Cliterate  Girls & Sex OMG YesBeducatedVanessa Marin s Finishing schoolIt can also be helpful to talk to a mental health professional about any negative feelings or past experiences around sex.  Address any shame you feel about sex.  Balestrieri said.  Shame ― unless it s part of your kink ― is an inhibiting experience. It makes us feel small and unworthy. and when it comes to pleasure and the permission one gives themselves to feel pleasure. shame is a huge barrier to orgasm.  I explain right away to my clients that this is often a long journey ― not to scare anyone. but to create realistic expectations for what they can expect.  Rankin said.  There is no magic pill for finding an orgasm. It is often a deep dive into your own sexuality. emotional wounds. psychological blocks. beliefs. as well as learning new skills. Patience is key. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with your body and try to remain relaxed and optimistic. Focus on the fun exploration and in-the-moment sensations.  Stay positive and be patient.  Allison said.  Don t be discouraged or feel something is wrong with you. Sometimes it could simply be a new rubbing technique or vibrator that surprises you with that special sensation. or even a new partner that brought that special something. Hang in there and enjoy as you explore and try new things. Remember. it s a journey. not a race. And you re so worth it! ,Health News
OMAHA. Neb. (AP) — A child likely died from a rare infection caused by a brain-eating amoeba after swimming in an eastern Nebraska river. health officials said. making it the second such probable death in the Midwest this summer and raising the question of whether climate change is playing a role.The Douglas County Department of Health based in Omaha. Nebraska. reported Wednesday that doctors believe the child died of primary amebic meningoencephalitis. a usually fatal infection caused by the naegleria fowleri amoeba. Health officials believe the child came into contact with the amoeba on Sunday while swimming in the Elkhorn River just west of Omaha.Officials have not released the child s identity.Last month. a Missouri resident died of the same infection likely caused by the amoeba at Lake of Three Fires in southwestern Iowa. Iowa officials closed the lake s beach as a precaution for nearly three weeks.People are usually infected when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose while swimming or diving into lakes and rivers. Other sources have been documented. including tainted tap water in a Houston-area city in 2020. Symptoms include fever. headache. nausea or vomiting. progressing to a stiff neck. loss of balance. hallucinations and seizures.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says naegleria fowleri infections are rare — there are about three cases in the United States every year — but that those infections are overwhelmingly fatal.There were 154 cases reported between 1962 and 2021 in the U.S.. with only four survivors. according to the CDC. Of those. 71 cases were reported between 2000 and 2021. Texas and Florida recorded the most infections with 39 and 37 cases respectively. and the amoeba is typically found in southern states because it thrives in waters that are warmer than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius).But infections have migrated north in recent years. including two cases in Minnesota since 2010. Douglas County Health Director Dr. Lindsey Huse noted during a news conference Thursday. Our regions are becoming warmer.  she said.  As things warm up. the water warms up and water levels drop because of drought. you see that this organism is a lot happier and more typically grows in those situations. According to the National Water Information System. the surface water temperature near where the child was swimming was between 86 and 92 degrees.Jacob Lorenzo-Morales. a researcher at the Universidad de La Laguna in the Canary Islands who has studied naegleria fowleri. said Thursday that an increase in infections since 2000 can be blamed on two factors: better knowledge and diagnosis of the disease. and the rising temperature in bodies of water providing  a perfect environment  for the amoeba to thrive.Researcher Sutherland Maciver. who has studied the amoeba at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at Edinburgh Medical School in Scotland. says not all infections are reported and that the 430 cases that have ever been reported worldwide are almost certainly an undercount. And. he said. scientists cannot say with certainty that the Nebraska case is directly attributable to climate change.The two researchers co-authored a paper titled  Is Naegleria fowleri an Emerging Parasite?  that examined factors behind the increase in reported cases.Health officials recommend that freshwater swimmers plug their noses. avoid putting their heads underwater and avoid activities such as water skiing and tubing. which could force water into the nose. eyes or mouth. You cannot be infected by drinking contaminated water.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. is setting aside an extra 50.000 doses of monkeypox vaccine for places with upcoming gay pride events. health officials said Thursday.The number of doses sent to each place will be based on factors like the size of the event. how many health workers will be available to give shots. and how many of the attendees are considered at highest risk for catching the virus. More shots in arms is how we get the outbreak under control.  Bob Fenton. the White House monkeypox response coordinator. told reporters Thursday. He said the effort is an attempt to  meet people where they are. At least a dozen U.S. pride events are scheduled over the next two months. including large gatherings in Atlanta and New Orleans in early September. U.S. officials said they will send up to 2.000 additional doses to North Carolina. where the Charlotte Pride Festival & Parade will be held this weekend.has been canceledFrank Perez. a former grand marshal of the parade that s the centerpiece of Southern Decadence. said a number of New Orleans gay bars have already had vaccine events. He said so far officials have done an adequate job with the vaccine campaign although  more is better. Dr. Rochelle Walensky. director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. cautioned:  While we are offering the vaccine at these events to those at high risk. this is a two-dose vaccine series. and receiving the vaccine at the event will not provide protection at the event itself. Health officials also are urging other steps to prevent the spread of the virus. including temporarily limiting sexual partners.spreads easilyhistorically seenhas been canceledFrank Perez. a former grand marshal of the parade that s the centerpiece of Southern Decadence. said a number of New Orleans gay bars have already had vaccine events.

NEW YORK (AP) — The head of nation s top public health agency on Wednesday announced a shake-up of the organization. intended to make it more nimble.COVID-19The CDC s director. Dr. Rochelle Walensky. told the agency s staff about the changes on Wednesday. It s a CDC initiative. and was not directed by the White House or other administration officials. she said. I feel like it s my my responsibility to lead this agency to a better place after a really challenging three years.  Walensky told The Associated Press.The CDC. with a $12 billion budget and more than 11.000 employees. is an Atlanta-based federal agency charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. It s customary for each CDC director to do some reorganizing. but Walensky s action comes amid a wider demand for change.The agency has long been criticized as too ponderous. focusing on collection and analysis of data but not acting quickly against new health threats. But public unhappiness with the agency grew dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts said the CDC was slow to recognize how much virus was entering the U.S. from Europe. to recommend people wear masks. to say the virus can spread through the air. and to ramp up systematic testing for new variants. We saw during COVID that CDC s structures. frankly. weren t designed to take in information. digest it and disseminate it to the public at the speed necessary.  said Jason Schwartz. a health policy researcher at the Yale School of Public Health.Walensky. who became director in January 2021. has long said the agency has to move faster and communicate better. but stumbles have continued during her tenure.In April. she called for an in-depth review of the agency. which resulted in the announced changes. Her reorganization proposal must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services secretary. CDC officials say they hope to have a full package of changes finalized. approved. and underway by early next year.Some changes still are being formulated. but steps announced Wednesday include:—Increasing use of preprint scientific reports to get out actionable data. instead of waiting for research to go through peer review and publication by the CDC journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.—Restructuring the agency s communications office and further revamping CDC websites to make the agency s guidance for the public more clear and easier to find.—Altering the length of time agency leaders are devoted to outbreak responses to a minimum of six months — an effort to address a turnover problem that at times caused knowledge gaps and affected the agency s communications.—Creation of a new executive council to help Walensky set strategy and priorities.—Appointing Mary Wakefield as senior counselor to implement the changes. Wakefield headed the Health Resources and Services Administration during the Obama administration and also served as the No. 2 administrator at HHS. Wakefield. 68. started Monday.—Altering the agency s organization chart to undo some changes made during the Trump administration.—Establishing an office of intergovernmental affairs to smooth partnerships with other agencies. as well as a higher-level office on health equity.Walensky also said she intends to  get rid of some of the reporting layers that exist. and I d like to work to break down some of the silos.  She did not say exactly what that may entail. but emphasized that the overall changes are less about redrawing the organization chart than rethinking how the CDC does business and motivates staff. This will not be simply moving boxes  on the organization chart. she said.Schwartz said flaws in the federal response go beyond the CDC. because the White House and other agencies were heavily involved.A CDC reorganization is a positive step but  I hope it s not the end of the story.  Schwartz said. He would like to see  a broader accounting  of how the federal government handles health crises.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

The White House COVID-19 response coordinator said the Biden administration aims to transition out of managing the pandemic day-to-day and focus instead on planning for future pathogens. We are working very hard to make sure that transition is in a very kind of orderly. a very transparent way so everybody sees it coming.  Dr. Ashish Jha said Tuesday at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.Jha said the government should be financing the next generation of vaccines. therapeutics and diagnostics as the U.S. moves past the COVID pandemic emergency phase and settles into a  new normal.  One of the things we ve spent a lot of time thinking about in the last many months — and we re going to continue this work. and you ll hear more from the administration on this — is getting us out of that acute emergency phase where the U.S. government is buying the vaccines. buying the treatments. buying the diagnostic tests. We need to get out of that business over the long run.  Jha said.By next year. COVID treatments. including vaccines. should be integrated into the regular health care system for people to access in the same way that they seek help for other diseases. he said. My hope is that in 2023. you re going to see the commercialization of almost all of these products.  Jha continued.  Some of it is actually going to begin this fall. in the days and weeks ahead. You re going to see commercialization of some of these things. So we just move them into the regular health care system. Jha cautioned that plenty of issues. including regulations and market dynamics. still need to be resolved before the government can assume a more supervisory role.describe  I expect this fall and winter to look much more like the fall and winter of 2019 than the last two years. with a lot less mitigation.  Jha predicted.  And that means we should be ready for more flu and more COVID.  The flu. in pre-pandemic times. already strained the health system. he noted. Throw in COVID on top of that. our health care system is going to get into serious trouble unless we are very proactive about preventing it.  he said. adding that testing and treatment will play important roles this winter.Jha advised people to seek an updated COVID booster when it becomes available and to get a flu shot. Businesses and schools. he said. should look at ways to improve indoor ventilation.,Health News
Planned ParenthoodNovember s midterm electionsthe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. WadeU.S. Senatea torrent of money raised after the decision by the high court s new conservative majorityPlanned Parenthood says its spending will help remind voters in Arizona. Georgia. Michigan. Minnesota. Nevada. New Hampshire. North Carolina. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin what s at stake in a bid to drive turnout by Democratic and independent voters. Who wins in these midterm elections will determine whether a state has access to abortion and potentially determine whether we will face a national abortion ban.  said Jenny Lawson. the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes.  We will be clear about who is on which side. A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchvoters rejected by nearly 20 percentage pointsWhether it truly is a galvanizing issue will become clear after Election Day. Nov. 8. We say this every cycle: ‘This is the important election.   said Amy Kennedy. a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes in Georgia.  For us. this really is the most important election cycle of our life. Planned Parenthood says it intends to contact 6 million voters through door knocking. phone calls. digital advertising. mailers and radio ads. It has already run some TV ads in Wisconsin. where Republicans control the statehouse and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are up for reelection.takecontrol2022.comRepublicans have expressed an interest in pursuing a national abortion banDemocrats and their allies have long tried. without much success. to energize supporters by focusing on abortion. But the Supreme Court s decision clarified the stakes as never before. In roughly a dozen states led by Republicans. abortion has already been banned or heavily restricted. Many more are expected to follow. When people go to vote this November. nearly half of the folks voting could be living in a state that either has already banned abortion or is quickly moving to ban abortion. These are entirely new circumstances.  Lawson said.  There are a lot of issues people care about. certainly. but the state of abortion access is absolutely one of the defining issues this November. ,Health News
BOISE. Idaho (AP) — Idaho lawmakers who made it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling banning such obstacles must pay $321.000 in legal fees to the winning side after losing in the same court.Republican Gov. Brad Little and Republican Secretary of State Lawerence Denney on the State Board of Examiners on Tuesday approved paying the winning side s legal fees set by the court in June.The court in March 2018 banned Idaho from automatically rejecting applications from transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. The court ruled the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.But lawmakers in 2020 approved a ban anyway. and Little signed the bill into law. The 2018 case was reopened and Idaho lost again. resulting in the $321.000 legal bill. The state previously paid $75.000 after losing the initial case in 2018.The plaintiffs in the case were represented by Lambda Legal. which on its website describes itself as a national legal organization working to get full civil rights recognition for lesbians. gay men. bisexuals. transgender people and everyone living with HIV. The plaintiffs sought roughly $450.000. but the court reduced that amount to what it considered reasonable by looking at the case s complexity and hours billed.The Board of Examiners typically sends such bills to the Constitutional Defense Council. comprised of the governor. attorney general and leaders of the House and Senate. The council controls the constitutional defense fund that has traditionally gone to pay the winning side s legal fees when Idaho loses court cases. That fund has paid out more than $3 million.But the board on Tuesday instead sent the bill to the Legislature. The Legislature isn t scheduled to meet until January. Meanwhile. the $321.000 is growing at an interest rate of 2.14% until it s paid. according to a letter from the Idaho attorney general s office to Brian Benjamin at the state controller s office.The Legislature has several potential options for paying the bill. Benjamin said. Lawmakers could send it to the Constitutional Defense Council. There is also the legislative legal defense fund controlled by the leaders of the House and Senate. currently Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder.Finally. lawmakers could appropriate the money from some other source.Regardless.  it s all taxpayer money.  Benjamin noted.,Health News
WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Americans will be able to buy hearing aids without a prescription later this fall. under a long-awaited rule finalized Tuesday.The Food and Drug Administration said the new regulation cuts red tape by creating a new class of hearing aids that don t require a medical exam. a prescription and other specialty evaluations. Instead the devices will be sold online or over-the-counter at pharmacies and other retail stores.proposed the ruleBiden administration officials highlighted the potential cost savings. Today s action by the FDA represents a significant milestone in making hearing aids more cost-effective and accessible.  Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. said in a statement.The move follows years of pressure from medical experts and consumer advocates to make the devices cheaper and easier to get.Cost is a big obstacle now. Between the device itself and fitting services. Americans can pay more than $5.000 to get a hearing aid. Insurance coverage is very limited. and Medicare doesn t pay for hearing aids. only diagnostic tests.The new over-the-counter status won t apply to devices for more severe hearing loss. which will remain prescription only.Consumer electronic companies for years have produced lower-cost  personal sound amplification  devices. but U.S. regulations bar them from being marketed as hearing aids and they do not undergo FDA review. The new rule makes explicit that those devices are not alternatives to FDA-vetted hearing aids. Companies that market them inappropriately could face penalties. such as fines or product seizures.The FDA said it changed several parts of its initial proposal in response to public comments. including clarifying how the federal rule will impact state regulations on hearing aids.Once the federal rule takes effect. traditional manufacturers are expected to begin selling cheaper. direct-to-consumer models.

I found out I was pregnant on Mother s Day 2022. Six days after Politico leaked Justice Samuel Alito s draft decision on overturningWhen I began having pain in my lower abdomen. I thought I had a urinary tract infection. My sample revealed something else. The urgent care doctor told me I was  like. super pregnant  — her exact words. I cried as she gave me instructions for next steps. The front desk secretary brought me one of the balloons her own daughters had given her. It had the words  Best MOM Ever  displayed on a pastel rainbow background. She handed it to me and said congratulations. I thanked her for something I did not want. I held hands with my husband. Andrew. who was as shocked as I was. We tried to be polite as the doctor asked us how long we d been together. We told her since high school. She said it was about time we had kids. Everyone around us was thrilled. I was a great anecdote. The young woman who found out she was pregnant on Mother s Day. I couldn t believe that even with my IUD. with the surprise and my lack of enthusiasm. not one of them seemed to register that I was devastated.The over-happy doctor told me my due date was Dec. 28.I ve never felt so alone.At 26. I m living in Los Angeles. I m about halfway through a Ph.D. program in English literature. trying to get my dissertation topic approved. so I can write about the politics of gendered embodiment in science fiction. As the word  dystopia  is bandied about by anyone with a smartphone. I find myself much too close to the intersection between my research and personal experience.Pregnancy was not in the short-term plan. my IUD — an intrauterine device — was supposed to have over 99% effectiveness within 3-5 years. But statistics don t seem to matter when you become the less-than-1%. When we got home. I tried on excitement to see if it could fit. I imagined what it would be like to have a baby in less than a year. I thought about where to put the crib in our apartment. We d always planned to move closer to home when we got pregnant. but neither of us felt ready to leave LA yet. I wondered how our cats would react to a baby. I imagined telling our families. Andrew s mom and sister would be overjoyed. the two of them wear motherhood better than anyone else. My own family is big and chaotic. they would welcome a baby with fanfare. like we all welcomed my twin nieces a year ago. And the best. the brightest vision. was a Christmas spent in our small apartment. both of our families in attendance. and me either too swollen to move. or holding a little winter baby. so delicate it would command the reverence reserved for a representative Christ child. The day. I spent attempting happiness.The night snuffed it out. I woke up in the dark. engulfed in the certainty that the life Andrew and I had built — our friendships. our careers. our financial independence. our future plans — was being swallowed up.I couldn t have a baby. I told Andrew in the morning. His relief was apparent. making it clear how he wanted this to turn out. Together. we willed the pregnancy to vanish. The next day. I made a last-minute OB-GYN appointment. Tests confirmed a pregnancy. but the ultrasound revealed nothing inside my uterus. Given the date of my last period. the doctor told me. there was probably something growing outside of it. I was sent straight to the emergency room. A missed ectopic pregnancy will grow too large for the fallopian tube. which is not meant to hold anything larger than an unfertilized egg. The tube will burst. Blood will seep into the abdominal cavity. The patient will double over in pain and begin to bleed to death. I took my time walking back to the car and driving to the ER. afraid that any undue jostling would bust that sucker open. The wrong step and it all comes down. It was odd. being in the hospital without either of my parents for the first time. When I was a kid. my dad was a cardiologist. and my family visited him at his office all the time. After he was diagnosed with leukemia. we spent seven months visiting him in the restricted oncology ward. He died when I was 17. Waiting in the ER. I itched to call him and tell him I was being poked with needles.That night. I was subjected to an agonizing transvaginal scope. The tech moved the wand around inside me with a terrible certainty. not pausing or even talking to me. It went on much longer than I expected. and I stared at the print of a tree branch that d been laid over the ceiling light. convincing myself it was almost over. The laborist on-call came hours later to discuss my test results. He had the largest eyebrows I d ever seen. like gray feathers pasted above his eyes. He asked what had brought us in. so I began to run through it all again. I told him we d had a positive pregnancy test. and he stopped me to say.  I assume this was a home pregnancy test?  I said no. that I had an IUD and didn t plan to be or want to be pregnant. that I thought it was a UTI. That the doctors at the OB-GYN were certain it was ectopic. He said.  OK. let me take a look at your chart here.  He brought the paper he was already holding to eye-level. glanced over it.  OK.  he said.  I ve got your levels on here. and it looks like we re going to be sending you home. You should come back on Thursday. when I will be working again. so I can see you and we can determine the kind of pregnancy. If it is ectopic. we should be able to give you some methotrexate and you ll pass it.   And if it isn t ectopic and I don t want it? The treatment will be the same?  He looked up. seeming to see me for the first time and replied.  The treatment will be the same. yes.  We thanked him despite not feeling particularly enlightened or understood. He took his eyebrows elsewhere. We made a plan to come back on Wednesday night to avoid him. On Wednesday. I felt normal — I had no pain. and the promise of answers in the evening gave me some confidence. I went shopping to distract myself. Standing in an aisle at Target. I started to feel wrong. My head began to float. my hands shook. my stomach dropped. I drove home. and Andrew brought me our biggest bowl to throw up in. I began having cramps — not terrible. but unsettling. given the situation. We decided to head back to the ER. We waited in a triage room. The physician assistant assigned to us came in only twice in six hours. Around 8 p.m.. a nurse poked her head in and informed me I was being moved to a room. Feeling frayed. Andrew and I ventured deeper into the hospital.We waited only briefly before the doctor. a woman with very dark skin and an ageless face. came in to greet us. She informed us that after seeing my ultrasound and looking at test results. they had determined that the pregnancy was indeed ectopic. She clicked around on the computer. grabbing an image from the transvaginal ultrasound. She pointed to the screen:  This is your uterus. right here. Here s your intestine.  She paused to make sure we understood.  This.  she said. circling a large black area with her finger.  is fluid that shouldn t be here. This is blood. There s a lot of it in the wrong place. which is how we know that your fallopian tube has ruptured. The doctor came to sit next to me. She took my hand.  These ultrasounds are nearly identical to the ones you had two days ago. I m going to be honest. I don t know how anyone sent you home after seeing this.  She told me that based on the amount of blood in my abdomen. the tube ruptured days ago. The pain I felt the day before Mother s Day was not because a pregnancy was causing strain on my bladder. It was because my left fallopian tube had ripped open.I had been bleeding internally for five days before anyone figured it out. Dr. Eyebrows. then. had sent me home despite clear medical evidence that my life was in danger. Despite the very real likelihood that I could have died between my two ER visits. I suspected he sent me home to create time. to delay further procedure. just in case the pregnancy that I did not want turned out to be viable. In looking for a baby. he did not see me.I got through the surgery without complications. It was laparoscopic. meaning the time to heal and scarring would be minimal. My throat hurt from being intubated. but the meds kept most of the pain away. I got to go home less than 24 hours from my arrival the evening before. Andrew cared for me for the next few days. He lifted me in and out of bed to go to the bathroom. He went to the store over and over as my appetite changed. He walked around the apartment complex with me and waited every time I had to stop and sit down on the low walls and benches. At my check-up. the doctor told me she couldn t believe I had surgery less than two weeks ago. She removed my IUD. seeing it in her hand was an enormous relief. So long. you defective bitch. She placed a Nexplanon in my arm. She told me she s placed hundreds of these and had never seen anyone get pregnant. In the limbo of my surgery. the world seemed to move on without me. I missed a trip to Yosemite with Andrew s family. I missed beach days and movie nights and drinks. My friends stopped by with flowers and baked goods. My mom sent a huge bouquet. My family FaceTimed me over and over so I could see my nieces. and I spent a lot of time pretending to eat the crackers they tried to feed me through the phone. In the days after my surgery. it seemed like everyone was pregnant. A woman in my department is due Dec. 28 — the same day I was supposed to be. A friend from high school announced she s having a girl. My cousin — who has also had an ectopic pregnancy — announced her second child. I didn t want a baby. I still feel like I lost one.I used to rationalize my conservative upbringing and pro-choice ideology by telling people that although I didn t think I d ever get an abortion myself. I would never remove that option for someone else. Someone who needed it in a way I didn t. I had a super-effective form of birth control. a partner who loved me above anyone else. a steady income. health insurance. a network of siblings. parents and in-laws who were already enthusiastic aunts and uncles and grandparents. I thought I would never have a reason to hesitate.On my fourth wedding anniversary. the decision is announced — Roe v. Wade was overruled. struck down in an argument of  faulty historical analysis  and the claim that the Constitution  does not confer a right to abortion.  I read stories like mine. I read stories that are much worse. About abusive relationships. People who don t have access to contraceptives. A 10-year-old who was raped and refused an abortion in Ohio. People who were raped by men they knew. by men they didn t. Ectopic pregnancies that were left too long because abortion pills are inaccessible. and miscarriages that turned septic because without assurances for sexual assault reporters. admitting to a pregnancy can be a life-threatening action. Without sex education. without widespread contraceptive access. without medical care. without parents who are open about sex. preventing a pregnancy is incredibly difficult. Knowing how to respond to a pregnancy is even harder. Today. you can hardly tell anything happened to me. I have some scarring in my belly button. and two pink dots to the right and left. I ve returned to my research. to my writing. my running. my social life. But the malaise lingers.Now more than ever. I understand that a womb can be a terrible burden. That there will always be those who will only see me in terms of reproduction. After the surgery. so many people checked in. So many people were kind and concerned. So many people wanted to know if this would affect my ability to get pregnant again. I reassured them that it won t be an issue. I still have one fallopian tube. a small connection to my visions of a future with children. A small connection I ve never been so tempted to sever.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

NASHVILLE. Tenn. (AP) — The family of country singer Naomi Judd filed a court petition Friday to seal police reports and recordings made during the investigation into her death.Judd s deathThe petition was filed on behalf of her husband Larry Strickland and her daughters Ashley and Wynonna Judd. A representative provided it to The Associated Press with the family s permission.Ashley has previously saidThe court filing also included details about how Ashley Judd found her mother alive after she shot herself. Ashley stayed by her mother s side for 30 minutes until help arrived.The petition asks the court to prohibit the Williamson County Sheriff s Office from releasing the records for several reasons. including that the disclosure would include her medical records and that the family has a right to privacy.Tennessee public records law generally allows local law enforcement records to be released. but police have the discretion to hold records while an investigation is ongoing. Once an investigation is closed. that exemption no longer applies. The AP left a message for the sheriff on Friday seeking comment.Strickland. Wynonna and Ashley Judd submitted statements outlining their concerns about the records. Strickland said in the court filing that he was unaware that his interviews with law enforcement were being recorded and that he shared personal and private information to assist in the investigation.Ashley Judd said she was in  clinical shock. active trauma and acute distress  when she spoke with law enforcement and that she did not want those records. including video. audio and photos. to permanently stay in the public domain and haunt their family for generations.The petition said that media outlets in Tennessee had already filed public records requests in her case.,Health News
Pets don t always smell particularly fragrant. Curious dogs and cats certainly can get into some stinky situations.But at times a bad odor is a sign of something more serious. If you can rule out external factors — like rolling around in something foul-smelling — and a bad scent persists. it might be time to seek professional help.Zoetis Berst and other experts told HuffPost about some common medical conditions that manifest in odor changes and what scents to look out for.  Skin infections frequently change how a dog or cat smells.  Berst said.  The smell may be associated with itching. redness. hair loss or change in coat texture. Malassezia dermatitis is a yeast infection of the skin that is fairly common in dogs and can occur in cats as well. Pumpkin Pet InsuranceChronic skin yeast infections come with a number of other symptoms. Pay attention to abnormal smells. irritated skin or behavior that suggests skin discomfort. Pets with underlying allergies may also be more prone to developing skin infections. Staph infections on the skin may have no odor or might smell sweet.  Wooten said. She noted that bacterial skin infections are usually associated with redness. hair loss. bumps that resemble pimples. skin flaking and oozing from skin folds.  Skin that reeks of corn chips has an infection of Pseudomonas bacteria.  Wooten added.  This skin is just red and itchy as well. This is more severe than ‘Frito feet.  which is a commonly searched term and considered normal in dogs. Bacteria can also cause skin abscesses ― pockets of pus on the body that can be quite painful and might produce a distinct odor.  Abscesses smell terrible. putrid.

PHOENIX — Democrat Katie Hobbs said she doesn t regret her decision not to debate her Republican opponent for governor. Kari Lake — a move that even some of her supporters don t agree with given such a tight race. A debate never helps a candidate win.  the secretary of state told HuffPost after an event Saturday with about a dozen people at a restaurant in Glendale. Arizona.  I mean. it is — we re talking to voters and I guarantee it s not something they re concerned about. I guarantee the person who is rationing their insulin or opening their refrigerator and figuring out how they re going to put food on the table with the groceries they have left for the week ... isn t going to open their ballot and say. ‘Damn. I wish Katie had done a debate.  polling average spectacle It s not uncommon for strong incumbents to pass on debates with lesser-known challengers. It s much less common in a close race for an open seat.Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has already debated his challenger. first-time candidate and venture capitalist Blake Masters. Everything about [Lake] is a distraction from the fact that she has no experience. no qualifications. no plans to lead the state.  Hobbs told HuffPost.  She s spent a career reading off a teleprompter. and she s trying to distract from the fact that she s not ready for the job. The daggers aren t just from Republicans. Prominent Democrats are frustrated with Hobbs. a former social worker and legislator. for her refusal to debate and run a more aggressive campaign against the telegenic. Donald Trump-backed Lake. something supporters alluded to in conversations at events this weekend. The average voter these days. I don t think they care one way or another.  said Martin Quezada. the Democrat candidate for Arizona treasurer who debated his opponent. Kimberly Yee. this month.  But for me. I think I would have preferred that she debated. But I can t blame her for not debating. Kari Lake is really good at turning that into a show and performance. she s a professional. Hobbs is not. That s not her style of governing. Cathy LaSusa. a Hobbs supporter from El Mirage. also said she understands the reasons for rejecting a debate but wishes Democrats were more into  fighting for democracy  and not  taking the high road  all the time. I know that people were disappointed that Katie didn t want to debate.  she said.  But on the other hand. we need to stand up to these people. which is a near impossible feat. The debate issue has come up during the course of phone-banking. she added.  People were disappointed. But they understood once I explained [why].  LaSusa said.Lake flayed Hobbs at a western-themed rally on Saturday. drawing a crowd of several thousand to a ranch north of Phoenix for a rodeo and country music. One couple showed up dressed like  Where s Waldo?  and waved a sign that read  Where s Katie?  — an apparent dig at Hobbs for not going head to head with Lake and not being as visible on the campaign trail. My opponent Hobbs — racist Hobbs — refuses to show up for any type of debate.  Lake told the crowd.  I said. ‘Katie. you pick the place. You pick the moderator. Even if [ The View  host] Joy Behar wants to moderate. I m OK with that.  I said. ‘Katie. you pick the questions. Just show up and stand before the people of Arizona. They deserve to hear from you.  Other Hobbs voters waved off concerns about any electoral fallout from the two candidates not meeting onstage before the Nov. 8 election. I don t think it would make a difference.  said Monica Pimentel. a school board member from Glendale.  Kari Lake is professional talker. She knows how to spin a story. that s been her job for over 20 years. Katie Hobbs knows what the issues are. I believe that if she had to debate Kari Lake it would just be a circus. ,Health News
extraordinary subpoenaDonald TrumpCapitol riotdirect roleThe committee is demandingBut Rep. Liz Cheney. the committee s vice chair. on Sunday rejected the possibility. She said the committee. which makes its major decisions with unanimous consent. would not allow Trump s testimony to turn into a  food fight  on TV and she warned that the committee will take action if he does not comply with the subpoena. We are going to proceed in terms of the questioning of the former president under oath.  Cheney. R-Wyo.. said on  Meet the Press  on NBC.  It may take multiple days. and it will be done with a level of rigor and discipline and seriousness that it deserves. We are not going to allow — he s not going to turn this into a circus.  We have many. many alternatives that we will consider if the former president decides he is not going to comply with his legal obligation. a legal obligation every American citizen has to comply with a subpoena.  she said.It is unclear how Trump and his legal team will ultimately respond. He could comply or negotiate with the committee. announce he will defy the subpoena or ignore it altogether. He could go to court and try to stop it.family businesshandling of presidential recordsIt s possible his lawyers could simply run out the clock on the subpoena if they go to court to try to squash it as the committee of two Republicans and seven Democrats is required to finish its work by the end of the year.Cheney. in the television interview. made her position clear that Trump had committed  multiple criminal offenses  and should be prosecuted. She cited his repeated efforts as outlined by the Jan. 6 committee to undermine democracy by denying his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden and by spurring his supporters in the violent attack on the Capitol. We ve been very clear about a number of different criminal offenses that are likely at issue here.  Cheney said.  If the Department of Justice determines that they have the evidence that we believe is there and they make a decision not to prosecute. I think that really calls into question whether or not we re a nation of laws. lost in Wyoming s August primaryWhile saying it may take  a couple of election cycles.  Cheney insisted the Republican Party can find its way back as a defender of democracy and the Constitution. as she put it. She pointed to the 2024 presidential campaign as a pivotal moment. I think that the party has either got to come back from where we are right now. which is a very dangerous. toxic place. or the party will splinter and there will be a new conservative party that rises.  she said.  And if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party. the party will shatter and there will be a conservative party that rises in its place. She said Trump has shown  his willingness to use force to attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power. And there are simply many. many millions more Americans who. despite any party affiliation. understand how dangerous that is. ,Health News
lamenting the  patients who. in place of affection. are administered death. Canada prides itself on being liberal and accepting. said David Jones. director of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Britain.  but what s happening with euthanasia suggests there may be a darker side. ___Euthanasia. where doctors use drugs to kill patients. is legal in seven countries — Belgium. Canada. Colombia. Luxembourg. Netherlands. New Zealand and Spain — plus several states in Australia.Other jurisdictions. including several U.S. states. permit assisted suicide — in which patients take the lethal drug themselves. typically in a drink prescribed by a doctor.In Canada. the two options are referred to as medical assistance in dying. though more than 99.9% of such deaths are euthanasia. There were more than 10.000 deaths by euthanasia last year. an increase of about a third from the previous year.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — The polio virus has been found in New York City s wastewater in another sign that the disease. which hadn t been seen in the U.S. in a decade. is quietly spreading among unvaccinated people. health officials said Friday.The presence of the poliovirus in the city s wastewater suggests likely local circulation of the virus. the city and New York state health departments said.State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said the detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York City is alarming but not surprising. The risk to New Yorkers is real but the defense is so simple — get vaccinated against polio.  New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a statement.  With polio circulating in our communities there is simply nothing more essential than vaccinating our children to protect them from this virus. and if you re an unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adult. please choose now to get the vaccine. Polio is entirely preventable and its reappearance should be a call to action for all of us. made eligible for booster dosespolio infection in Rockland County.Most people infected with polio have no symptoms but can still give the virus to others for days or weeks. Vaccination offers strong protection and authorities urged people who haven t gotten the shots to seek one immediately.Based on past outbreaks. it is possible that hundreds of people in the state have gotten polio and don t know it. officials said.Polio was once one of the nation s most feared diseases. with annual outbreaks causing thousands of cases of paralysis. The disease mostly affects children.Vaccines became available starting in 1955. and a national vaccination campaign cut the annual number of U.S. cases to less than 100 in the 1960s and fewer than 10 in the 1970s. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A small percentage of people who polio suffer paralysis. The disease is fatal for between 5-10% of those paralyzed.All schoolchildren in New York are required to have a polio vaccine. but Rockland and Orange counties are both known as centers of vaccine resistance.,Health News

COVID-19The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said people no longer need to stay at least 6 feet away from others.The changes are driven by a recognition that — more than 2 1/2 years since the start of the pandemic — an estimated 95% of Americans 16 and older have acquired some level of immunity. either from being vaccinated or infected. agency officials said. The current conditions of this pandemic are very different from those of the last two years.  said the CDC s Greta Massetti. an author of the guidelines.The CDC recommendations apply to everyone in the U.S.. but the changes could be particularly important for schools. which resume classes this month in many parts of the country.Perhaps the biggest education-related change is the end of the recommendation that schools do routine daily testing. although that practice can be reinstated in certain situations during a surge in infections. officials said.The CDC also dropped a  test-to-stay  recommendation. which said students exposed to COVID-19 could regularly test — instead of quarantining at home — to keep attending school. With no quarantine recommendation anymore. the testing option disappeared too.Masks continue to be recommended only in areas where community transmission is deemed high. or if a person is considered at high risk of severe illness.School districts across the U.S. have been scaling back their COVID-19 precautions in recent weeks even before the CDC relaxed its guidance.Masks will be optional in most school districts when classes resume this fall. and some of the nation s largest districts have dialed back or eliminated COVID-19 testing requirements.Some have also been moving away from test-to-stay programs that became unmanageable during surges of the omicron variant last school year. With so many new infections among students and staff. many schools struggled to track and test their close contacts. leading to a temporary return to remote classes in some places.The average numbers of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths have been relatively flat this summer. at around 100.000 cases a day and 300 to 400 deaths.The CDC previously said that if people who are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations come into close contact with a person who tests positive. they should stay home for at least five days. Now the agency says quarantining at home is not necessary. but it urges those people to wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested after five.The agency continues to say that people who test positive should isolate from others for at least five days. regardless of whether they were vaccinated. CDC officials advise that people can end isolation if they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of medication and they are without symptoms or the symptoms are improving.___Binkley reported from Washington.

On a brutally hot Friday in July. I am standing in a condo in Denver. My husband Thomas and I have just closed on it. and we re going to be renting it to a good mutual friend. My closest friend. in fact. who has just moved to Denver from Oregon for a new start following her divorce.I m super hot and sweaty. but it s not related to the outside temperature. Instead. it is from overwhelming anxiety because this building has an absolutely amazing pool. and I am wearing the first swimsuit I ve owned in over three decades ― 31 years. to be exact.For virtually any woman. this would be daunting. As a fat woman. I m finding the idea suddenly terrible and terrifying. It s not just a swimsuit. It s two pieces.I haven t worn a two-piece since I was 2 years old. I tell Thomas. although it s definitely not a bikini. It s similar to a sports bra (but with a zipper) and some bike shorts. except they can be cinched up at the sides with ties.It s honestly more modest than the last bathing suit I owned. which was leopard print. high cut on the thigh. and also had a zipper ― but one on a much lower neckline. Still. I haven t felt this exposed since my last Pap smear. I m thinking about telling Fae. my friend. that I can t do this after all. But she s going to a pool party the next day. and this was her way to get used to the idea of being in public in a swimsuit. Plus. she just told me she s on the way. she s got a beach ball with her (at my request). and I know. if I give it a chance. we re going to have fun. I don t want to let her down. and I don t want to let myself down. either. So instead of letting my anxiety win. I am pulling my improvised cover-up (a knit nightshirt) over the swimwear. taking a deep breath. adjusting my messy ponytail. swiping on some lip gloss (everything is easier with lip gloss). and then heading down to meet Fae. Once she s there. I immediately feel better ― still nervous. but not nearly as much so. It helps that the pool is virtually empty. There s one person using the attached hot tub. and a woman with her grandchild. On one of the deck chairs. a much smaller fat person reads a book. and they are also in a swimsuit in public. I find myself thinking maybe I can do this after all. We re entering the pool area. and as the smell of chlorine hits me I remember...My grandparents had an above-ground pool my entire life. up until the summer of 1999. when ― after decades of faithful service. and most of the best memories of my childhood ― it finally grew old and tired and collapsed in the strong winds of a New Jersey summer thunderstorm. My grandfather loved that pool. and I think the only other person who loved it as much as. if not more than. he did was me. He wasn t much for talking. but one afternoon shortly after the collapse. he was working on cleaning up the remnants of the pool and breaking it down. I was visiting. and I took off my flip-flops and walked in the few inches of water remaining in the lining. Though there were others around. I remember catching his eye at one point. and it felt like just the two of us were at a funeral for a dearly loved friend. I had tears in my eyes. and I think he did. too. That summer was the last summer I went swimming until now. Not only have I not worn a swimsuit in 31 years. but I have not even been in a pool in 23 years. Still. I am not really shocked that the smell of chlorine feels like the smell of summer. hope and freedom. and I find it emboldens me. I sit down next to Fae. and look at her. and say.  Coverups off in three?  And we count to three. but mine is off before we get there. and I hear myself saying.  I m a fat person in a swimsuit in public. and I m still alive and nothing has exploded.  If I m being snarky. that s always a good sign.I ve handed her my phone. because I need photos of this. I already know I want to pitch this story. and if nothing else. I want to share it on my Instagram. If others see it. perhaps they ll find themselves ready to take this leap again. too. I m suddenly acutely aware that all of the anxiety and fear is gone. I m in a bathing suit. In public. Sure. there are not many people around. but more can show up at any moment. and I m not even a little bit scared anymore. Instead. I m walking into the water. and the temperature is damn near perfect. Cool enough to be refreshing on a day that breaks triple digits. but not cold at all. As I walk down the steps. I find myself grateful for the beach ball because I m so out of practice that I m not sure what to even do at first. But then. after the initial quick photos. when I m more than waist deep in water. I am awash in memories... memories of how much I have always loved this sensation. I m feeling absolute elation.When Fae joins me. I m immediately ready to goof around in the water. We play with the beach ball. and I remember that I have zero coordination for this kind of thing. But swimming? Being in the water? It feels like I ve just returned home after traveling. It doesn t feel like 23 years. It s like catching up with an old friend you haven t seen in years and discovering it doesn t feel like it s been more than a few days. And it s wonderful. Later. I am looking at the photos Fae took. fully expecting to hate them. Body dysmorphic disorder is a bitch. and I could have the  perfect  body and I would still find reasons to hate it. Many of the perceived flaws I hate are unrelated to my weight. but it is very hard to be fat in a culture like ours without absorbing some level of loathing over the idea of seeing yourself in photos. Combating this is one reason I take so many now. But when I pull up the photos. I don t see any ugliness. I don t immediately pick apart my flaws. real or not. Instead. what I see is pure. unfiltered joy. I see myself radiating happiness. and I am both overjoyed by this. but also profoundly saddened for my past self.Thomas later tells me the last time he saw me look this happy was in South Dakota. when a pregnant. beautiful wild burro approached me and bowed her head to me as I sat on a bench. I can t argue with him. and that was one of the happiest moments of my life (and also 5 years ago). As I go through the photos. I am realizing I ve denied myself this joy for over two decades. Why? Because as a fat person. even if I had access to swimwear that fit me. I didn t think I deserved it. I didn t think I could swim in public ever again. Even worse. for about 10 years. I felt like I was  sparing  other people from my fatness by not wearing a bathing suit. I had internalized all that messaging. and it cost me years of joy. Over the past 15 years. as I ve worked on healing my relationship with both my body and food. there were many times I remembered a church picnic I went to in 1988. when I was 12. The place where my then-church had their annual picnic was on acres and acres of open land. with a gorgeous in-ground pool. In all the years we went. this was the only time that pool was open to us. I was the fattest girl ― or more accurately. the only fat girl at all. But I was the only one who fearlessly jumped into the pool in a bathing suit without a T-shirt over it. I was the only one not whining about being too fat. (Since I actually was and none of the others were. this struck me as especially irritating). I even remember the boys acting like the other girls were being ridiculous. and seeming impressed with both my swimming abilities and my willingness to just go for it. I remember that I was having fun. I was entirely un-self-conscious. It never even occurred to me to cover up. I was doing something I loved. something I knew I was good at. and it showed. Why did I deny myself this joy for over two decades? Why do any of us do this to ourselves. out of fear of what anyone else thinks or says? If the past few years have taught us anything. it should be that life is too short. too precious and too fragile to spend time wasted on other people s ideas of who we should be or what we should wear. When I look at the pictures of my July swim. I see shades of that 12-year-old I was. the one I ve admired so many times over the years. I feel like maybe she s been here with me all along. and that she has just said to 46-year-old me.  Welcome back. It s been too long.

A World Health Organization official spoke up for monkeys following a string of attacks against primates in Brazil. saying they re not responsible for the growing monkeypox outbreak. Margaret Harris. a WHO spokesperson. told a United Nations news conference in Geneva on Tuesday that the monkeypox virus has been found in many animals and is more common in rodents than monkeys. Harris explained the only reason the virus was named monkeypox was it was first identified in a group of monkeys in Denmark. What people need to know very clearly is the transmission we are seeing is happening between humans to humans. It s close contact transmission.  Harris said.She continued:  The concern should be about where it s transmitting in the human population and what humans can do to protect themselves from getting it and transmitting it. They should certainly not be attacking any animals. according to local outlet G1. and more cities have reported similar attacks.The Washington Post saidsaid in Junedeclaredexpressed reservations strategy to split vaccine doses data,Politics News

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Walgreens can be held responsible for contributing to San Francisco s opioid crisis for over-dispensing highly addictive drugs for years without proper oversight and failing to identify and report suspicious orders as required by law.San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said the pharmacy chain  continually violated what they were required to do under the federal Controlled Substances Act.  failing to track opioid prescriptions. preventing pharmacists from vetting prescriptions and  nor did they see the many red flags of physicians and others who were dramatically over-prescribing.  Pharmacists were pressured to fill. fill. fill.  he said.  and as a result. Walgreens filled our streets with opioids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that for 15 years. Walgreens dispensed hundreds of thousands of pills. eventually contributing to the city s hospitals being overwhelmed with opioid patients. libraries being forced to close because of syringe-clogged toilets. and syringes littering children s playgrounds in San Francisco.A Walgreens spokesman said the chain is disappointed in the outcome. which he said is not supported by the facts and the law. As we have said throughout this process. we never manufactured or marketed opioids. nor did we distribute them to the ‘pill mills  and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis.  spokesman Fraser Engerman said in a statement.  The plaintiff s attempt to resolve the opioid crisis with an unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law is misguided and unsustainable. We look forward to the opportunity to address these issues on appeal. Allergan and Teva agreed to payWednesday s ruling did not include a ruling on monetary damages. which will be determined in a future trial.The opioid epidemic has been linked to more than 500.000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades. counting those from prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and generic oxycodone as well as illicit drugs such as heroin and illegally produced fentanyl.Mayor London Breed declared a state of emergencyThe city attorney s office says San Francisco saw a nearly 500% increase in opioid-related overdose deaths between 2015 and 2020 and that on a typical day. roughly a quarter of visits at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Emergency Department are opioid-related.In 2020. 712 people died of drug overdoses. compared with 257 people who died of COVID-19. according to the city health department.A high percentage of an estimated 7.800 homeless people in San Francisco — many of whom pitch tents in the Tenderloin — are struggling with chronic addiction or severe mental illness. often both. Some people rant in the streets. nude and in need of medical help.Pharmacy chains have been sued less often than opioid makers or wholesalers that distribute pharmaceuticals more broadly. In one groundbreaking case. a federal jury in Ohio last year found CVS. Walgreens and Walmart recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two Ohio counties.Walgreens reached a $683 million settlement with the state of FloridaThe company also faces litigation in Alabama. Michigan and New Mexico. among other states.Deerfield. Illinois-based Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. runs a network of around 9.000 drugstores in the United States.

Chrissy TeigenJohn LegendInstagram10% to 20%1% The Trying Game: Get Through Fertility Treatment and Get Pregnant Without Losing Your Mind. It doesn t feel like the first time [when] I was over the moon. Like Teigen. Klein became pregnant via IVF. so she was monitored carefully in early pregnancy. with regular blood draws to ensure that hormone levels were rising correctly. as well as early ultrasounds. Though such procedures can offer patients reassurance. awaiting them may also foment its own kind of anxiety.ou re waiting for the numbers to go up. and then you re waiting for the heartbeat. then you re waiting for the first trimester.  Klein said.  As much as you don t want to get your hopes up. you can t help but feel attached to this child growing inside of you.  Dear Rainbow Baby. I was hyperaware of anything that could go wrong. any spotting. any cramps.  compared with the first time. when  miscarriage didn t even cross my mind as a possibility.  Becoming pregnant after miscarriage.  I had to learn how to trust my body again.  Gassman said.If you re experiencing the joy wrapped in fear that is pregnancy after loss. here are a few things to consider as you ride the emotional roller coaster of the coming weeks.If you re not a fertility patient with access to lots of early ultrasounds and you need the reassurance of seeing the baby s heart beat. talk with your doctor. advised Jacqueline Fernando. a California psychotherapist who specializes in fertility issues. Some will say.  We re going to sneak you in for a quick ultrasound.  Fernando said.  Those doctors are priceless.  You may or may not want to share your news with family and friends. depending on how much you lean on their support. but that doesn t mean you can t find safe spaces to talk about what you re going through. Consider finding a support group. Hearing another mom say. ‘You know what. I ve been there.  there s so much power in ‘me. too.   Fernando said. Resolve: The National Infertility Organization All the women are having some sort of worry. right?  said Fernando.  There s so much power in being vulnerable. While it s not specific to those who have experienced loss. a prenatal yoga class can offer another kind of community — with the additional bonus that they re people you don t know. so you can focus on being pregnant in the moment and not worry about what you would say if you were to miscarry. It s not for everyone. but some people find comfort in creating a ritual or memorial to honor the child they lost.  Typically. we don t have anything to honor this life.  Fernando said.  It s a very weird grief. There s nothing tangible.  she added. but that doesn t stop you from making something. Planting a special plant or tree. for example. can  provide an opportunity for [partners] to take a more active role in that healing process.  Other children can participate as well. Fernando recalls women telling her that while their partners may not talk about the loss. they can sometimes be found caring for the tree the family planted. Gassman created a memorial for herself using the images from her only ultrasound during that pregnancy.I think that helped me compartmentalize.  she said.  We could still grieve the baby. I could do that when I wanted to.  while at the same time she was  also able to move on.  Writing was another outlet for Gassman.  It helped me look forward.  she said.  I feel like it forced me out of my grief.   Those writings became this letter to a baby we didn t even have yet.  she explained. and  eventually turned into the manuscript for ‘Dear Rainbow Baby.   In addition to deciding when and how to share the news of your pregnancy. you can set boundaries to protect yourself during this emotionally vulnerable time.  Give yourself permission to take care of yourself. if that means laying low for a while. not talking to people.  Klein said.  that s what you have to do.   You have to protect your emotional space.  she continued. You do not. for example. need to attend any baby showers. Just give yourself permission to not be happy for others  pregnancies. he longer the pregnancy progresses. people expect you to be happy. and you re not happy.  Don t pressure yourself to perform a happiness you don t feel. ou re not going to be happy until you re holding this baby in your arms.   It s OK to wait for your happiness.  Klein said. Klein and Fernando stressed the importance of taking things one week. or one day. at a time. Forty weeks can feel like an eternity. So can those first 12.Fernando suggested setting small goals and prioritizing stress-reducers. such as nourishing food. exercise and sleep.  Sleeping is so paramount in fighting anxiety.  she said. Simple deep breathing and meditation are ways to help get you through the day. Fernando said. noting that meditation can take many forms. Swimming. for example. helps you to focus on your breath and your body and allows you to count strokes. all of which are meditative.Honor whatever feelings you are experiencing. and don t feel pressured to change them for others  expectations. or your own. And if a sliver of happiness does sneak its way into your psyche?  Sometimes I remind the women that it s not finite.  Fernando said. Preventing yourself from feeling happiness now won t blunt the pain of a future loss.  So why not allow yourself that joy?  ,Health News

failedDemocratsA majority voted for it ― 57 senators ― but it wasn t enough under the Senate s 60-vote rule for passage.Yet just a few hours later. the Senate successfully protected subsidiaries of private equity companies from a new 15% corporate minimum tax rate included in the legislation.It received the same number of votes as the insulin cap amendment. but this time the Senate rules required only a simple majority to pass it.The difference in fate between the two votes. both of which received support from same-sized majorities. shows how the Senate s arcane and frequently arbitrary rules often add to an already malapportioned legislative body s bias toward powerful interests. People with diabetes looking for help to afford lifesaving medication need a supermajority. while a simple majority is just fine for private equity managers looking to protect their fruitful investments.Joe BidenThe combined effect of Senate rules is to create additional chokepoints for interest groups to exploit. It s not a coincidence that every major piece of economic legislation passed through the Senate during Biden s administration had the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. which represents America s largest and most powerful businesses. until Sunday s passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The bill raises taxes on investors and large corporations. and spends the cash reducing the deficit and investing in clean energy and health care subsidies. while also giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. The House is expected to pass the legislation and send it to Biden later this week.on a party-line vote in the 50-50 SenateThe provision to cap insulin prices would have limited co-pays for insulin at $35 a month for people on private health insurance plans. But the Senate s parliamentarian. an unelected official accountable only to members of the upper chamber. ruled it fell outside of what s allowed under reconciliation.RepublicansInsulin prices have spiked in recent years. and Americans pay as much as 10 times more than what the drug costs in other economically developed countries. Four-fifths of diabetics who take insulin say the cost of the drug causes them financial hardship.  This won t just save money. it will save lives.  Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said on the floor before the vote.  This should not be a hard vote to cast. The legislation still limits insulin co-pays to $35 a month for people who use Medicare. and Democrats have promised a stand-alone vote on legislation sponsored by Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) to keep costs low. But unless three additional Republicans are willing to back the legislation. it will fail under the Senate s 60-vote threshold. Two of the world s largest drug companies. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of rising insulin costs. Since the beginning of Democratic control of Congress in 2021. the two companies have spent massive sums lobbying against cost controls: Eli Lilly has spent $11.4 million. according to federal lobbying records. while Novo Nordisk has spent $5.8 million. The private equity amendment. on the other hand. was backed by a powerful industry with a powerful ally in Sinema. who had already forced Democrats to strip out an effort to tighten a loophole abused by the industry. The Arizona freshman feared the minimum tax would hit small- and medium-sized businesses with private equity backing. with a spokesman saying her goal was to  target tax avoidance. make the tax code more efficient. and support Arizona s economic growth and competitiveness. Other Democrats said Sinema s concerns were nonsensical: Unless the businesses had more than $1 billion in revenue. they would be untouched.  I don t know very many small businesses at home that have a profit of a billion dollars a year.  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. told reporters on Saturday night.  This is a very small number of businesses. Still. with Sinema s support and the amendment s passage assured. six other Democrats facing potentially tough reelection battles in coming years – Mark Kelly of Arizona. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire ― voted for it. hoping to avoid the industry s wrath in the future. Though Sunday s dueling votes provided a clear example. the powerful have long abused Senate rules. When senators were still chosen by state legislatures in the 1800s. wealthy men often bribed local officials to gain entrance to the chamber. a practice that culminated in Montana in 1899. when two mining magnates each spent $1 million on bribes hoping to win a Senate election. In the first half of the 20th century. Southern senators filibustered every single attempt at civil rights legislation.In more recent years. decisions by Democrats and Republicans to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominations has meant Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell could enact much of his agenda ― passing tax cuts and appointing judges ― with a simple majority. while more complicated Democratic goals. on issues from gun control to health care to voting rights. still require 60-vote pledges.As recently as December 2021. the Senate listened to cries of panic from business leaders and passed a one-time exception to the filibuster to raise the debt limit with fewer than 60 votes.The Senate is already far from a paragon of democracy: It grants states with small populations wildly disproportionate power over American politics. giving the typical rural American 37% more power than the average voter when it comes to determining control of the Senate. Small states are also far less racially diverse than bigger ones. meaning the typical Black voter has 17% less influence over who controls the Senate than an average voter. and a typical Hispanic voter has 33% less influence. The filibuster exacerbates the bias toward smaller states: The six senators who represent California. New York and Texas represent the same number of people as the 62 senators who represent the union s 31 smallest states. more than enough to sustain a filibuster. Senate rules also weaken the federal government s hands when it comes to combating state and local governments who abuse their powers: While GOP-controlled states passed a wave of voting rights restrictions this year. Democratic plans to pass legislation overriding them at the federal level were stymied by Manchin s and Sinema s insistence on protecting the filibuster.

Gottlieb said Sunday.  We re continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men. It s primarily spreading in that community. But there s no question that it s spread outside that community at this point. And I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly. Gottlieb went on to say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reluctant to broaden testing recommendations to include patients that present with other ailments such as atypical cases of shingles or herpes. The agency. he said. has been testing about 8.000 people a week for monkeypox out of a potential capacity of 80.000 tests in that time period.remove any stigmareportedexceedingly hard to come bybetter marshal resourcesprobably failed to contain monkeypox I think that probably the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low.  he said.

A proposal to cap insulin costs for people with private insurance won t be part of the sweeping climate and health care legislation that Senate Democrats are about to pass after Republicans moved to strip it out of the bill on Sunday.The Democratic proposal needed 60 votes to survive. but only seven Republicans joined the chamber s 50 Democrats in voting  yes. The high price of insulin is among the best-known. most extreme examples of high drug costs causing hardship for Americans. Insulin in the U.S. costs five to 10 times what it does in other economically developed countries. according to research by the RAND Corporation In one recent survey of people with diabetes who take insulin. nearly 80% said it caused them financial difficulty.Among them are people who have private insurance. but end up shouldering a large share of the cost directly because of high co-payments in their drug coverage. Democrats had hoped to address that by limiting those co-payments to $35 a month. and the version of the  Inflation Reduction Act  they brought to the floor on Saturday included such a provision. This won t just save money. it will save lives.  Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said.  This should not be a hard vote to cast. But in order to pass legislation through a simple majority vote. rather than the customary 60 it takes to overcome a filibuster. Democrats are using the  budget reconciliation  process. The rules of reconciliation stipulate that every legislative provision must have a direct. significant impact on the federal budget. The Senate parliamentarian. who advises the chamber on procedural questions. ruled that the insulin cap for private insurance did not satisfy that requirement.Democrats went ahead and included the provision in their bill anyway. effectively daring Republicans to strip it out ― a dare that 43 Republicans accepted when they objected to its inclusion on procedural grounds. Under the rules of Senate procedure. that was enough to prevail. The effort to cap insulin costs was not a total wash. The IRA legislation includes a similar provision limiting insulin to $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries. Republicans did not challenge that measure because the parliamentarian ruled it satisfies reconciliation requirements.And the insulin cap is just one of several IRA provisions designed to lower prescription costs that remain in the legislation. Others include authority for the federal government to negotiate the price of certain drugs in Medicare and a $2.000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug expenses in the program.But the insulin provision was one of the few that would directly affect people with private insurance. Another proposal designed to help people with private coverage. limits on year-to-year drug price increases in commercial plans. also got a negative ruling from the parliamentarian ― and Democrats didn t even try to include it afterwards.The insulin cap is popular. with 61% of likely voters supporting it strongly according to polling by Data for Progress. and Democratic leaders on Sunday wasted no time in attacking Republicans for their vote. After years of tough talk about taking on insulin makers. Republicans have once again wilted in the face of heat from Big Pharma.  said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).Republicans sought to preempt Democratic attacks over the insulin provision by proposing their own amendment aimed at making insulin available at federal community health centers. to be paid for by drawing funds from Obamacare. But Democrats blocked that measure. arguing it was insufficient. This likely isn t the last time the Senate will address the high cost of insulin. Democratic leaders have vowed to hold a vote on bipartisan legislation authored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would also cap the cost of insulin.seven Republican senatorsDemocratsRepublicansDemocrats are on track to pass the bill on Sunday. and their counterparts in the House are expected to approve it on Friday. sending it to President Joe Biden s desk. It includes historic investments to fight climate change and other measures to lower the cost of health care.As for insulin. one new possibility is the kind of state action that California is pioneering. Last month. its Democratic governor. Gavin Newsom. announced the state was using $100 million of its budget to manufacture and distribute low-cost insulin to residents.Such measures could help even people with no insurance. which the IRA insulin proposal for private insurance would not have.This is a developing story.

Whose suffering isThe New York Timesdeclaredmore than 7.000 casesserious inequitiesWorld Health Organization declared the outbreakdecidedThat s right: As long as monkeypox was only spreading at an uncontrolled rate among gay men — many of whom were experiencing extraordinary suffering — it was not seen as an emergency.has been endemicrecently lamentedexpertsScienceImagine my surprise when I awoke Monday after the WHO s declaration to find my phone bombarded with notifications. I had become a poster boy of activism demanding stronger government response to the outbreak. with my face and protest sign accompanying coverage on Al Jazeera and  NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt. and in print and online articles about the outbreak from Le Monde. NPR. the BBC. Gay City News. Forbes India. Them. The Washington Post and. most recently. on the homepage of Vox. Friends kept sending screenshots and messaging me.  You re famous!  I responded.  I m just one angry fag. A few days prior. I had attended a rally for action on monkeypox co-organized by a number of progressive queer activist organizations. including ACT UP New York and PrEP4All. for which I have enormous respect. The crowd that evening. consisting mostly of gay men. gathered in the oppressive heat. wearing  SILENCE = DEATH  T-shirts and carrying signs bearing sharp words. One sign read:  You Did This to Us in the  80s When AIDS Patients Needed Emergency Treatment.  Another declared:  This outbreak didn t need to happen. We are getting sick because of government failure.  Hurrying to meet friends at the demonstration. I jotted a slogan in marker on the lid of an empty shoe box:  MONKEYPOX: WHERE IS YOUR RAGE?  Echoing past ACT UP protests going back to its founding in 1987. the demonstration was symbolic and theatrical. but not only that ― it targeted a specific political site. Foley Square. a hub for New York City government where decisions about life and death are made. The site was also chosen because it was close enough that PrEP4All co-founder James Krellenstein could lead us in chants of  SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!  directed at the adjacent offices of the city s under-resourced and. at the time. unresponsive Department of Health.I found it ironic. and frustrating. that the photo of me and my white cis-male gay friends had taken off. when the demonstration had been admirably organized to platform the voices that are so often marginalized when it comes to public health issues. Speakers included veteran activists. queer people of color. trans men and women. sex workers and those living with disabilities and HIV. as well as a few local politicians.The organizers made a series of demands to expand vaccination and treatment. some of which. like releasing the antiviral treatment TPOXX from useless bureaucracy. have since been partly accomplished. Others. like getting the Food and Drug Administration to approve the hundreds of thousands of ready vaccine doses we have left sitting unapproved in a plant in Denmark. remain a national embarrassment and outrage. Further demands like providing financial support for those who are infected and cannot work. or who need alternate housing to quarantine. have yet to be addressed.I was glad my protest sign struck a chord. because it conveys a long history of queer activism channeling anger. I was specifically inspired by an ACT UP New York banner and poster I recalled from the New York Pride March in 1994. which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. The poster read:  AIDS: WHERE IS YOUR RAGE?  The reverse of the poster reads  HOW MANY OF US WILL BE ALIVE FOR STONEWALL 35?

Unlike HIV or COVID. monkeypox is a known pathogen for which we already had millions of doses of highly effective vaccines. This is an outbreak that we had the resources to contain. It s just that several levels of government failed to do so.The GuardianOf course. this is not the same as mass death. Still. we should recognize it as terrible suffering that s all the more tragic because much of it could have been prevented. These people s pain. unacknowledged and even denied. caused my rage.stigmatizeMordechai LevovitznotedblindnessSlateevidenceStill. the history of AIDS shows that it is crucial to avoid labeling monkeypox a  gay disease  or even a sexually transmitted one. AIDS was initially called  gay-related immune deficiency.  which led to stigma regarding not just AIDS but also groups like women. babies. and hemophiliacs being denied access to testing. drug trials and treatment. With children recently contracting monkeypox. there s reason to think this disease. too. could very well spread. Days before. at the rally. Levovitz had reflected on how this might fuel conspiracies about LGBTQ grooming.  In a few months from now. on the front of every magazine will be children with monkeypox on their face. And they ll blame us for this.  he said.  It is only our anger that will protect us. Despite the lessons of AIDS and COVID. the official response to monkeypox has been a disaster at every level of government. Starting in June. I heard horror stories of people exposed to the virus who could not get a vaccine or drugs that could have drastically ameliorated their sickness. I heard about other people. in agony. being turned away from emergency rooms and sent from doctor to doctor. ACT UP veteran Peter Staley was included on a large call with the Biden administration in early June. leading him to prematurely thank the administration for its early response in contrast to the AIDS crisis. But Staley has since condemned the U.S. response. calling it a  fucking mess.  and said.  There s just nobody acting like this is a fucking emergency.  While he said this response was not  AIDS 2.0  ― recalling how the Reagan government ignored gay victims due to blatant homophobia ― Staley described it as  COVID 2.0.  a repeat of the very same mistakes.Vaccines have been haphazardly and unequally allocated through crashed websites. long lines and unanswered calls to health agencies. Friends have likened getting a vaccination appointment to the Hunger Games. The latest round of thousands of additional vaccine appointments filled up within minutes. Many areas of the country have received no vaccine allocations at all. Scalable commercial testing was slow to be approved. and there is still no guarantee that it will be free as COVID tests are. we simply have not allocated enough resources.The response thus far has been chaotic and inadequate.  like saying we have a tanker of water coming next week when the fire is happening today.  says Gregg Gonsalves. an ACT UP veteran and Yale epidemiologist. Meanwhile. my queer friends in Canada were fully vaccinated many weeks ago. thanks to a rollout that has even attracted vaccine tourists. That proactive and coordinated response is much closer to what public health should look like.Public health in America doesn t have to be in such shambles. Indeed. it wasn t always this way. At the rally. ACT UP veteran and Treatment Action Group founder Mark Harrington reminded the mostly younger generation present about the remarkable response to the 1947 smallpox outbreak in New York City. Within just three weeks of its discovery. the U.S. Public Health Service and city health officials procured enough smallpox vaccine. largely within the city in public vaccine manufactures. to inoculate more than 6 million people. What could have been a deadly outbreak was nipped in the bud and resulted in only 12 infections and two deaths.Much of that infrastructure and know-how has been lost through decades of underinvestment and privatization since the Reagan years. It seems it is only in times of crisis that the American public remembers that health care is and has always been a right. Harrington s remarks reflected key lessons from ACT UP: Political progress is not won by heroic individuals. but by broad coalitions. and government only responds to crisis when it is forced to do so. Staley already says he regrets trusting the Biden administration s early promises about the steps it was taking.  We dropped the ball.  he said.  We just should have stayed in screaming mode every step of the way.  Who keeps us safe?  we chanted at the rally. And we answered ourselves:  We keep us safe.  Who protects us?  We protect us.

fertilityBut despite how advanced and normalized these options have become. there remains a serious barrier to entry: the cost. Matt Schulza 2020 report That s a staggeringly high total. especially when you consider that many women require multiple cycles to become pregnant and that there is no guarantee of success no matter how many cycles you go through.  Schulz added.  Given those costs. it is no wonder that many people say they just can t afford to do fertility treatments. It s really nothing short of heartbreaking. dollars in debtStill. is it possible to pursue fertility treatment without incurring serious financial setbacks? Below. Schulz and other experts share their advice for avoiding or minimizing the burden. The first step to managing any financial decision is determining your budget. Calculate your income and expenses each month to figure out what you re currently able to spend and any changes you might make to accommodate fertility treatment payments. It may sound simple. but a budget is where you have to start.  Schulz said.  You can t make a meaningful plan to attack debt unless you know exactly how much money is coming in and going out of your household each month. Once you know that. you can start to prioritize where your money goes. whether that is saving for a potential treatment. carving out more money to pay down debt or any other reason.  It sucks that it has to be this way. but the truth is that it is pretty much up to the people seeking treatment to turn over every stone and exhaust every option in looking for safe. reliable and less expensive treatment.  Schulz said.  Check to see if your employer s benefits cover these treatments. It s more common than you might guess. Look into your insurance coverage. While full IVF coverage might be hard to find. some insurance carriers cover other parts of the fertility treatment process ― like diagnostic testing and other assessments. There s also been recent progress on the side of employer-provided benefits.Fertility IQBrunch & BudgetShe believes more employers will add family planning benefits to their packages as the job market remains competitive. There are some ways to save money on IVF treatments.  Carson said.  Because pricing depends on the state you live in. some states like New York. California and Texas offer government programs to subsidize the costs of IVF treatments. There are also income-based grants and scholarships at the national level. number of organizationshelp families payAfter you get a sense of your coverage. find the right doctor for you. Your employee benefits might only apply to a specific provider. or you might have options.Some clinics also offer discounts for multiple rounds of treatment. so it s best to familiarize yourself with all possibilities. Once you know where you ll be receiving treatment. then you can make more meaningful calculations to determine the total cost of the endeavor. Shop around to different clinics.  Schulz advised.  Research different loan options. You can even consider leaving the country to receive treatment. though that s something that would require significant research and should not be entered into lightly. Traveling out of the country would also mean additional costs to take into consideration.  How we spend is a direct reflection of our priorities.  Schulz said.  For some. the idea of spending $20.000 for a treatment that might not even work doesn t make sense. Others wouldn t even hesitate to spend that much or more for as long as it takes. Whether you agree with the former. the latter or something in between. make sure that you do your due diligence and ask yourself some tough questions before you make the call. For many families. the stakes involved in the choice to pursue expensive fertility treatment are too high to justify it.  Unfortunately. you may have to ultimately decide that it just isn t financially feasible.  Schulz said.  Our absurdly high-priced health care in this country forces people to make heartbreaking decisions about their health and their family s wellbeing every single day. That s true whether you re talking about cancer medications. fertility treatments or countless other things facing Americans today. It s an absolute tragedy. but it is where we are right now. Tatiana TsoirEven if you can t fully avoid incurring debt. starting a fund can reduce the amount you ll end up having to take out in loans. Think about it sooner rather than later. Tsoir advised. now passive savingsMintDigit Fertility has a lot of hidden costs. including mental health and physical health.  Tsoir said.  The drugs you take affect your skin and your overall health and can affect your self esteem and. in turn. affect your mental health. Think about the time you might need to take off work to deal with potential issues. She recommended reading other people s accounts of the fertility treatment experience to give yourself a sense of things that could happen. ‘Super Attractor. RedditFacebookAvoiding any debt might not be possible for your family. but you can set yourself up to take out less money in loans and manage it well.  It is critical to understand what you re getting into before you apply for any of these loans.  Schulz emphasized.  Fertility treatments are so expensive. so making a rushed or ill-informed choice on how to finance them can end up being very costly. He suggested looking into credit cards with a 0% introductory interest rate. but ensuring you know what the post-introductory interest rate is in case you can t pay off the entire amount in that initial period. A personal loan is another option to help you manage your out-of-pocket costs. IVF loansCarson noted that the more favorable your credit score is. the less interest you ll have to pay. Consider a fixed-rate loan over a credit card where your payments are variable.  she said. This will help to keep your payments consistent and often offer a lower rate to borrow. And consider the length of time it will take you to pay the debt back ― choose a length of time that is going to fit within your budget. ,Health News
When I lost my baby girl. I had just reached the 20-week mark in my pregnancy. When she died less than an hour after her birth. she weighed barely more than a banana.One week earlier. my husband Joe and I saw her during an ultrasound.  She looks great.  the doctor assured us. as we gazed dreamily at the fuzzy images on the machine. After we left the St. Petersburg. Florida. clinic. I breathed a sigh of relief. We were almost halfway through the second trimester. Our daughter was growing normally. This was real ― we were having a baby.Until suddenly ... we weren t.I noticed the back pain the following Tuesday evening.It will go awayAs the afternoon melted into evening. my discomfort gradually intensified. Eventually. I couldn t walk upstairs without hunching over. When I finally called my doctor s after hours emergency line. around 10 p.m.. the nurse stated what was pretty obvious: I needed to go to the emergency room. Stat.  You could have a kidney infection.  she said. after I described my worsening back pain. A dose of antibiotics will fix this in no timeBut the nurse continued.  Or. you might be in labor.  She spoke in a kind. yet matter-of-fact way.We left for the hospital. As Joe drove. I took deep breaths and stared out the rain-streaked passenger side window. praying the nurse was wrong. Colors from the stoplights whizzed by: a kaleidoscope in red. yellow and green. As we sped off into the black Florida night. my life suddenly felt like that kaleidoscope. spinning and spinning. out of control.The nurse s phone diagnosis was. unfortunately. spot-on. Five hours later. after an agonizing natural labor (with only morphine for pain). I delivered our baby girl. Despite my pleading with the medical staff to try anything and everything to keep her alive. her lungs were simply not developed enough. and we were told she would not survive.  Can t you give her steroids?  I had yelled during the delivery. frantically shouting out various fixes that I vaguely remembered from Lifetime movies. Except in those situations. each story had a storybook ending. with the baby surviving and everyone living happily ever after.The nurses asked if I wanted to hold her. No.  I answered. which probably made me sound like a horrible person. In my defense. I was delirious from lack of sleep and the morphine. But more than anything. I was terrified. How would it feel. touching her while knowing that she would die? I didn t want to face it.Thankfully. my husband and I finally took the nurses  advice and held her. She was wrapped in a pink knitted Barbie-size blanket. Her skin looked like tissue paper ― translucent and fragile. Her face. not fully formed. resembled an alien. She moved her arm once.We named her Kathryn. after my mom. who had died one year earlier.The next day. as I put my clothes back on to go home. I was momentarily surprised by my flat stomach.10-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriageJust get through the first 12 weeksbigOne morning. when I was about nine weeks pregnant. I spotted blood in my underwear and froze. This is itIt s over. Bleeding is a lot more common than people think.  she said.Once I made it to the second trimester. I naively thought that everything would be OK.Back at home after the delivery. I existed in a foggy haze of grief. How could this have happened? I felt like I was swimming underwater and could never surface for air. Days earlier. I felt Kathryn kick for the first time. Now. all I had left of her were our matching hospital bands. the pink Barbie blanket and a Polaroid photo of her given to us at discharge.putting cabbage leaves on themNot neededKatie had flown in from Massachusetts. She slept in the spare bedroom alongside the early baby gifts ― the days of the week onesies. a stuffed yellow duck. a silver rattle ― bestowed upon us by well-meaning family and friends. Each time I saw them. I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. but I couldn t bring myself to part with them either. After Katie left. I spent my days obsessively searching the Internet for clues ― any minuscule piece of evidence that I had not done anything to cause the early labor. I wanted to find other stories similar to mine (comfort in shared grief) and to discover an explanation for why this had happened. I also wanted a glimmer of hope that this would not reoccur if I got pregnant again. The thought of another loss of this magnitude seemed unimaginable. More than anything. I wanted to be a mom to a healthy baby. It was a freak accident.  the doctor told me the day after the delivery. as I lay in the hospital bed. the TV humming in the background. But how could he be so sure? I was pregnant the last time that I saw them ... and now I m not.I couldn t bear to face my class or the co-worker at my school who was two months ahead of me with her pregnancy. We were supposed to go to prenatal yoga together. and I had imagined us becoming close friends and someday taking our babies to the park together. Would she avoid me now? Would I burst into tears at moment I saw her?I cried constantly. even on my daily trips to Starbucks. Sometimes. I walked the one-fourth mile in tears. composing myself before entering. only to resume crying again once I was back outside. the hot sun beating on my back.To take my mind off Kathryn. my husband suggested taking walks around our palm-tree-lined neighborhood. On many occasions. we inevitably saw pregnant women. To lighten the mood. I had taken up the habit of covertly cursing at them.  Fucking bitch.  I would whisper to Joe. after we passed another expecting mother. This gave me a smile. yet there was still a vast emptiness inside me. What I really wanted was to be just like them. strolling hand in hand with my husband as we discussed baby names. gift registries and Lamaze classes. Why were their babies still alive and mine wasn t?Despite my enormous pain. my experience connected me to others in a new way. Although I felt lonely. I was not alone. Colleagues and acquaintances reached out to recount their own failed pregnancy stories. One co-worker drove to my house with a handmade card and a potted lemon tree. She sat with me. crying. and shared her story of her full-term. stillborn son. Another called and told me about her multiple miscarriages. A parent at my school opened up about her 19-week pregnancy loss. My principal. Gaye. sent a card with a picture of yellow daffodils on the cover and a note that read.  Daffodils have always made me smile in the darkest of times. I thought I d wish some daffodils  power on you. She also delivered a large. rectangular box. covered in pink satin.  To keep special items in.  she had written. Although I found her gesture thoughtful. I shoved the box aside. not wanting to remember anything about those moments. I wished that I could close my eyes and wake up in a few months. pregnant again and on the path toward a healthy delivery. Like a bear hibernating in winter. I just wanted to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything around me had changed for the better.It s been 16 years since Kathryn s birth ― and death. I have two more children. ages 13 and 15. and I am thankful for them beyond words. Recently. I opened the pink box Gaye gave me all those years ago. Inside. I found her note in her loopy handwriting. a card from one of the aforementioned co-workers and numerous other heartfelt messages. I also found the Polaroids of Kathryn taken by the nursing staff and the hospital bands and pink blanket.miscarriagesstillbirthsMeghan MarkleChrissy TeigenMichelle ObamaEven though I have two more children. Kathryn will always be my first child. She is a part of my life to honor. not hide away. Devastatingly. these losses happen. But telling our stories can make us feel less alone.When Kathryn died. all I wanted was to forget and move on. Although I couldn t see it then. Gaye was right: I did need something to hold special items in. I didn t ― and still don t ― want to forget those moments. If I did. it would be like saying Kathryn never existed.

When preparing for the birth of her third baby. Grace Greene of Jackson. Mississippi. had every reason to believe that her planned home birth would go smoothly. She had delivered her second child at home with no complications and was familiar with the process.  I went to my 40-week appointment and everything checked out perfectly.  Greene told HuffPost. But her plans changed drastically before contractions even began.  A few days after that appointment. I woke up and noticed my baby wasn t moving.  said Greene. She headed into the hospital for monitoring. where she learned that the baby had no measurable amniotic fluid and that labor would need to be induced. At that point. my birth plan completely changed because he needed to be born quickly.  Greene said.  I felt overwhelmed at the severity of the situation and the speed at which everything happened.  she said.  After I gave birth. I began to learn more about fetal movement and realized what a close call it was when he had stopped moving. The more I learned. the more I realized how necessary it was to change plans. Greene said that over time she  learned to sit with the tension of thankfulness over the outcome coupled with disappointment for not having the birth experience I had hoped for.  Though not all changes to a birth plan are so dramatic. they are common. Most births include at least one element of surprise. and it may or may not be a welcome one. Given that birth is so likely to veer from the plan. what is the point of making a plan to begin with? And how receptive are providers to birth plans. anyway? If you ve been avoiding thinking about your impending birth because it scares you. writing a birth plan can give you an opportunity to work through some of those fears. And if you can hardly bring yourself to think of anything else as the big day approaches. writing your birth plan can bring you peace of mind that all of your caregivers will know what your preferences are.  I love the process of the birth plan.  said Mandy Irby. a former labor and delivery nurse who currently works as a childbirth and nurse educator in Virginia.That process. she said. involves  listening to your intuition about what choices you might make or what you might want your experience to look and feel like. And you re going to find competing ideas.  Though you may write out a longer version for yourself. your partner. and perhaps your doula (if you ve hired one). Irby suggest keeping the version that you bring the hospital  short and sweet. one page. so everyone can read it.  In talking over your birth plan with your provider. you may find that you can omit a number of things.Maureen Hodges. a labor and delivery nurse who is training to become a certified nurse-midwife. explained that some preferences are likely to be the standard of care at hospitals. so you don t need to specify in your birth plan that you want them. These include skin-to-skin contact after delivery. delayed cord clamping. breastfeeding assistance and having a doula or support person accompany you to the operating room if you have a cesarean section. Hodges mentioned. too. that she sees many birth plans indicating people don t want intravenous fluids. which are also standard in a hospital setting — although you may be able to get a saline lock. which allows for quick access to a vein without tethering you to an IV pole. This is exactly the kind of thing that writing a birth plan will force you to consider and discuss with your provider when you share it with them. It s one of the most important days of your life. but to the doctors. midwives or nurses caring for you. it s simply Tuesday. A birth plan is an opportunity to present yourself as an individual with your own story. knowing you will help them care for you better. Rather than approaching it as a checklist of preferences. like items on a menu. Irby suggests using your birth plan to communicate something personal. She calls this the  connection section  of the birth plan.If you write. for example. your baby s name and explain that they re a rainbow baby you ve been waiting years for. you ve gone from being the induction in Room 3 to a complete person with your own history.Though your nurses will meet you and read your birth plan for the first time when you arrive at labor and delivery. your provider should have seen the plan before.  Discuss your birth preferences with your provider in your second trimester. and then discuss specifics with them during your weekly prenatal visits from 36-40 weeks pregnant.  Hodges advised. Your provider should be interested in explaining their usual practices to you. as well as hospital policy.  she said.  It s a warning sign that your provider and you might not be a good match if you feel dismissed when discussing your birth preferences.  For many people. delivering a baby is their first time staying in a hospital. You may not have had a lot of previous interactions with health care providers. and it s normal to feel somewhat intimidated by their expertise. But no one knows your body like you do. and writing a birth plan gives you the opportunity to practice communicating your preferences and needs. In an emergency situation. such self-advocacy can be lifesaving. Articulating your own needs also prepares you for your new role:  a parent who s going to have to advocate for this tiny human forever.  Irby said. Because they often end up changing. birth plans sometimes get a bad rap and the occasional eye roll from a provider. Medical professionals are prone to  bristle.  Hodges said. when they read a birth plan full of  I don t want this  and  Do not.  which she believes indicate  a distrust of the hospital birth setting.  Rather than writing down a list of demands. use your birth plan to let your providers learn something about you that they won t see on your medical chart. Perhaps you need to inform them of your partner s pronouns or explain that it would help you if they ask for permission to touch you before every examination. You might let them know that you re afraid of hospitals and are hoping dim lighting will help you forget where you are. No matter how your birth story unfolds. advocating for your family s needs can help you feel a sense of control.Even an unplanned C-section. which Hodges said she often sees mentioned in birth plans as  a terrible last resort.  can be a  necessary. lovely. family-centered. joyous experience.  When you ve communicated your needs and you trust your provider. it will be easier to accept a change in your birth plan and move forward without regret. ,Health News

Environmental Protection Agency Laredo. Texas. Ardmore. Oklahoma. and Lakewood. Colorado. are among the communities facing the highest risk from ethylene oxide emissions. EPA said.The agency has notified 23 commercial sterilizers — 19 in the continental U.S. and four in Puerto Rico — that their operations pose an elevated risk of cancer and other ailments. The notice follows a recent survey of emissions data from almost 100 commercial sterilizers nationwide.Ethylene oxide is used to clean everything from catheters to syringes. pacemakers and plastic surgical gowns.While short-term or infrequent exposure to ethylene oxide does not appear to pose a health risk. EPA said long-term or lifetime exposure to the chemical could lead to a variety of health impacts. including lymphoma and breast cancer. EPA said it is working with commercial sterilizers to take appropriate steps to reduce emissions. Today. EPA is taking action to ensure communities are informed and engaged in our efforts to address ethylene oxide. a potent air toxic posing serious health risks with long-term exposure.  EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Wednesday.EPA will conduct public outreach campaigns in each of the communities where elevated risks have been found. including an Aug. 10 webinar.Laredo. one of the communities targeted by the EPA notice. is a border city where the vast majority of residents are Latino and more than a quarter live in poverty. Missouri-based Midwest Sterilization Corp. operates a sterilization plant in Laredo. The company also owns a plant in Jackson. Missouri that is on EPA s watch list.More than 40% of Laredo s nearly 70.000 schoolchildren attend campuses in areas with an elevated risk of cancer due to ethylene oxide emissions from the Midwest plant. according to an analysis by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune.A spokesperson for Midwest declined immediate comment. But the company told ProPublica and the Tribune last December that cancer risk from its Laredo plant is overstated. Emissions it reported to the EPA are  worst case scenarios.  rather than specific pollution levels. the company said.The Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association. an industry group. said in a statement that ethylene oxide has been used for decades by the health care community to sterilize a wide variety of medical devices and equipment. More than 20 billion health care products are sterilized each year in the U.S. alone.In many cases. there are no practical alternatives currently available to ethylene oxide. the group said. adding that use of less effective cleaning methods  could introduce the real risks of increased morbidity and mortality″ at hospitals throughout the country.EPA called medical sterilization  a critical function that ensures a safe supply of medical devices for patients and hospitals.″ The agency said it is committed to addressing pollution concerns associated with EO. sometimes called EtO.  in a comprehensive way that ensures facilities can operate safely in communities while also providing sterilized medical supplies.″⁣Proposed rules to update control of air toxic emissions from commercial sterilizers and facilities that manufacture EtO are expected by the end of the year. with final rules likely next year. EPA said.Besides medical cleaners. EtO is used in a range of products. including antifreeze. textiles. plastics. detergents and adhesives. It also used to decontaminate some food products and spices. Two of the 23 facilities targeted by EPA — in Hanover and Jessup. Maryland — are used to sterilize spices. Both are operated by Jessup-based Elite Spice.Other commercial sterilizers cited by EPA are located in Groveland. Fla.. Salisbury. Md.. Taunton Mass.. Columbus. Nebraska. Linden and Franklin.

A nurse strolled into the cold. sterile hospital room. She cheerfully introduced herself. then said:  You must be so happy to have made it 40 weeks with twins! How lucky! My hands instinctively went to my belly. the palms protecting and supporting me and my babies. A couple of hours away from our scheduled cesarean section. all I could muster was a tired half-smile. My husband. seated next to me. gently squeezed my shoulder. knowing at that moment my mind had pivoted to the twins we had lost during the second trimester many years ago.Hours later. after the successful delivery of our baby boy and girl. a new nurse came in to help me and asked how I was doing. As I looked at this stranger sheepishly. tears welled up in my eyes.  I m so glad it s all over.  I confessed.  I hated every minute of that pregnancy. In that moment. I felt the burden of truth lifting from my being. It was a lightness I had not known in years.My path to parenthood made me one of many statistics. I am one of the 1 in 8 women requiring fertility assistance. and also one of the 1 in 4 womenexperienced a miscarriage or pregnancy loss.In 2003. a few years into our marriage. my husband and I sought help from a reproductive endocrinologist to create our family due to a previous illness. We were inadvertently thrown into a world that required vulnerability. courage and trust. Begrudgingly. we had to admit:  We can t do this on our own. We need help. We began our fertility treatments naively thinking it would result in a pregnancy without issue. After a few unsuccessful back-to-back IVF cycles. it became clear that we d gravely underestimated the difficult nature of conceiving via assisted reproductive therapy.Though I was in my mid-20s. I felt like I was in a race against time. Thus. we continued with IVF cycles for three years. starting new cycles the moment we were given the green light. I never gave my body a chance to rest from the daily hormone injections. egg retrieval surgeries and embryo transfers. During that time there were chemical pregnancies. miscarriages and flat-out failed cycles.Intertwined with infertility were myriad feelings. from shame and guilt to unmet expectations. isolation and despondency. I underestimated the effect that years of failing to conceive would have on my mental and emotional health.After three years. we became pregnant with twins. I carried them until 17 weeks without issue. We could finally breathe a sigh of relief. And then one day. out of the blue and for an unknown reason. that light of hope vanished when my water broke unexpectedly. There wasn t any way to save the pregnancy.I was so numb from shock that I could barely process what was happening to me. I gave birth to my twins and had to say goodbye immediately. After that. I experienced life through a veil of anguish and despair.It was during this grief process that we finally had the chance to pause and decide our next steps. Truthfully. I could no longer handle the physical. mental and emotional toll of another IVF cycle. Thus. half a year after the loss of our twins. we pivoted in our approach to parenthood and pursued international adoption.We realized that families are created in many ways. and we were ready to try a different path to reach our goal of creating our own.Almost a year after we lost our twins. we became the proud parents of a 10-month-old boy. He was the physical manifestation of our unyielding hope. The veil of sorrow that had become a part of our daily existence finally faded away. A year of joyful parenthood. however. renewed our sense of optimism. so we decided to try one more IVF cycle at a new fertility center in Denver. We became pregnant with twins again. but this time I carried the pregnancy to term and gave birth to a healthy boy and girl. A common misconception of pregnancy after ART and/or loss is that the birth of a child washes away the pain experienced from infertility. miscarriage or pregnancy loss. Alas. happy endings cannot erase the effects of trauma. Rather. the happiness just pushes the pain to the back of one s mind. The immense impact of the trauma of trying to conceive has stayed with me since.Failing to live up to society s expectations of  womanhood  resulted in tremendous shame. I struggled with years of degradation that eventually manifested in a fight for control of my body. A few years after the birth of my twins. my untreated mental health issues snowballed into bulimia.The eating disorder was a cry for help. I lived with this horrible secret for a year unbeknownst to my family and friends. One night. I was putting our 5-year-old and our 3-year-old twins to sleep. I had thrown up the dinner I d had with them earlier that evening. As I was tucking them into bed. I caught a glimpse of myself in their mirror. and I didn t recognize the person looking back at me. After so many years of trying to create my family. I finally had one ― but I couldn t fully enjoy life because I was so broken inside.I decided I was tired of living a lie. I confessed my secret to my husband and we found an outpatient facility where I received treatment.  I used my eating disorder recovery as an opportunity to finally begin the necessary work to heal from the damage caused by infertility. During the healing process. I unearthed many truths. Perhaps most profound was the idea that I felt the need to  control  my body through my eating disorder partly because it was uncooperative reproductively. My recovery has continued to teach me lessons on loving myself unconditionally.As life progressed. every year after the birth of our twins. we received a letter from the storage facility that safeguarded the many embryos from our last IVF procedure. Our embryos were born out of pain and suffering. but they were also created from a tremendous amount of hope. For four years we decided to keep them frozen. On the fifth year. my husband opened up the letter and said to me.  I think it s time we give these embryos a chance.  I closed my eyes and tried to visualize myself agreeing to another round of IVF. Could I reopen the wounds of trauma from all the years of failed cycles and the loss of our twins. enduring more physical. mental and emotional pain? Could I risk the ramifications of another pregnancy loss. now that I was a mother to three little children?I opened my eyes and felt my chest and back tighten. My heart raced and the words got stuck in my throat. After a drawn-out moment. I murmured another truth I had confronted during my healing journey.  I can t. I just can t do it again. I m so sorry.  As my apology trailed off. my body morphed into a messy convulsion of heaving sobs.In spite of this honest realization. my husband and I could not ignore the existence of our frozen embryos. We wanted a chance to grow our family. So we decided to pursue surrogacy. It was a privilege to be able to explore this option. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. gestational surrogacy accounted for just 1% of all ART cycles in 1999. but that figure rose to 2.5% by 2013. It was an unparalleled journey that was complicated to prepare for and experience.In addition to asking a medical team to help me have another child. I was now asking a complete stranger to extend a monumental kindness to me and my family. After finding a surrogacy agency. we waited almost half a year for our turn in the queue to receive and review the dossiers of surrogates. We reviewed many applications and interviewed a few candidates via Zoom. It was daunting to determine the right person to trust to carry our embryos and hopefully become pregnant. Once we finally matched with a surrogate. legal documents had to be drafted before we could even begin the medical treatments. When we finalized our paperwork. our surrogate had to undergo numerous physical tests to get medical clearance. Once this preliminary clearance was complete. our surrogate was able to go through the protocol for a frozen embryo transfer requiring daily shots and monitoring. At every step of the process. an unthinkable level of trust. vulnerability. collaboration and communication was required. When we first started our surrogacy journey. I was quick to highlight the physical reasons that led us to pursue this route: unexplained infertility. unexplained loss and an incompetent cervix that required surgery and bed rest in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy. I never disclosed another important factor in our choice ― the fact that I no longer had the mental and emotional bandwidth to carry a subsequent pregnancy.Throughout the course of our surrogacy process. I battled my insecurity. shame. jealousy and sadness. In the beginning. the feelings consumed me. However. as the pregnancy progressed and my relationship with our surrogate developed and strengthened. so. too. did my fortitude. Without complications. our surrogate gave birth to our twin boys. Forever indebted to her. I think of her whenever I look upon my boys  faces. A few years ago. after receiving more annual reminders of our remaining embryos. we decided to give our very last set of frozen embryos a chance. In addition to working with a new surrogate. my approach and mindset for this journey were markedly different. I had already confronted the mental hurdles during the last surrogacy process. I now walked into this relationship with more self-compassion and grace. Like a third of Americans trying to conceive. our path to parenthood was the complete opposite of a textbook experience. As we aspired to become parents. we confronted many challenges necessitating decisions that came with the stigma of choice and the pervasive effects of mental health issues. Almost two decades after our first IVF cycle. we are now the proud parents of seven children: a 15-year-old son. 13-year-old boy/girl twins. 6-year-old twin boys and 1-year-old twin girls. Our nontraditional paths to parenthood and life as a mother have taught me so many lessons. not least about the power of love and its role in creating families. Although becoming a mom required navigating countless hurdles. it was worth it. every time. to see my children s smiling faces and experience their joy and wonder.At first. it was difficult to discuss our decisions to pursue adoption. IVF and surrogacy because most people were unable to comprehend our unique circumstances and thus our actions. With the gift of hindsight and a lot of inner work. however. my perspective changed. I learned to view our choice to ask for help as a sign of our bravery and grit.Those in the infertility community often refer to themselves and one another as warriors. Some eschew this term. but I feel it to be an apt description of the war that I endured within my mind and body.For 17 years. I battled against my circumstances and made decisions that caused whispers behind my back. In spite of it all. it took our second surrogacy journey. and finding an online community of fertility advocates. to help me find strength in my story and my voice. I take pride in speaking up about women s physical and mental health issues in an effort to destigmatize and normalize these important conversations. As a fertility. pregnancy and parenting mindfulness coach. I often remind my clients that their past does not define them. Rather. your past can serve as a source of inspiration and strength.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

The phrase  fake it till you make it  can feel like a cliché. but there s some value to this idea in the mental health field.The expression is often evoked in describing the concept of behavioral activation ― a useful tool in managing conditions like depression and anxiety. But what exactly is this approach. and how does it compare to the idea of  faking  confidence. competence or positive emotions in order to achieve results?Below. mental health professionals break down the meaning and effects of behavioral activation. as well as the best ways to apply this technique in your everyday life.Playa Vista CounselingA common symptom of depression is the inability to engage in behaviors that used to bring a person joy ― even though those behaviors would likely help alleviate their depression. Examples include socializing. exercising. cooking nice meals. self-pampering with showers and skin care routines. trying new activities and more.@citytherapist Our mental health and emotional state is so tied to the behaviors we engage in.  Thomasian said.  Deciding to stay in bed and going on a morning walk release very different chemicals in our brain. create starkly varying thoughts in our mind that then reinforce or break our emotional state. Engaging in behaviors that foster a healthy mental state can create a positive ripple effect that in turn encourages you to continue participating in those activities. This concept is at the root of the popularization of self-care.Bisma AnwarInitially. these actions might feel daunting and require a lot of effort. But if you commit to just giving it a try. you activate the positive reinforcement system. Sue VarmaAnother way that behavioral activation can improve mental health is by helping people become more aware of which activities give rise to positive emotions. and which have the opposite effect. A person using this approach might also be reminded that they have the ability to experience joy. and remember how it feels.Marianela Dornhecker This technique is often accompanied by the idea of ‘fake it till you make it  because at the time. you may not feel like doing the things that are part of the behavioral activation. such as going for a walk or planning a nice meal with a friend.  Gitlin said.  The technique asks that you not think too hard about whether or not you genuinely feel like doing something ― i.e. fake it ― and instead focus on completing the task itself. In a sense. behavioral activation is like pretending that you feel better. But in doing this positive behavior. you ll likely develop some positive feelings that can lead to  an upward spiral of motivation.  Gitlin said. Still. some experts say there are crucial differences.  There is an aspect of ‘fake it till you make it  because you re activating behaviors that don t necessarily align with your current emotional state or idea of your sense of self.  Thomasian said.  However. I think the difference comes from the intent of the behavior. She offered running as an example. Following a pure  fake it till you make it approach.  you would fake being a runner even though you re a beginner. until you eventually get good at running.  In behavioral activation. there is a different end to the means.  Thomasian said ― it s more like  I m going to start running even though it s the last thing I want to do. because doing so will help my emotional state. Besides. if you think of behavioral activation as  faking  your motivation to do an activity. it could affect your intentions and make the technique less likely to work.author of  A Deeper Wellness: Conquering Stress. Mood. Anxiety. and Traumas. Dornhecker believes a better way to think about the mechanism of behavioral activation is the idea that  energy begets energy.  When someone is experiencing depression. their brain can feel like it is in a fog. or everything feels ‘underwater  or dulled out. which can lead to low activity.  she explained.  This low activity actually has the effect of creating even lower energy and decreasing motivation. However. when someone makes the decision to do an activity that requires energy (even if they don t feel like it). this actually has the effect of creating more energy in the body and thus increasing motivation and mood. Behavioral activation can take many forms. but here are some general steps for using this technique. 1. Monitor your actions and feelings.Shagoon MauryaYou can keep a journal or download an app to take notes about what you re doing and how you re feeling. As you track your actions and the emotions they evoke. make a list of the behaviors that make you feel good and commit to implementing them in your everyday life.Sanam HafeezOnce you ve determined which activities improve your mood and give you a sense of purpose. challenge yourself to do them more. even if you can t always find the motivation. Repetition is key.  Vermani said.  You want to become bored by what makes you anxious. apprehensive and uncomfortable. The more you do something. the less intimidating and threatening that activity feels. The less threatening an activity becomes. the less power cognitive distortions and maladaptive thoughts [have]. 2. Set achievable goals for positive behaviors.Vermani recommends setting achievable goals by focusing on one or two behaviors at a time and practicing them on a regular basis.  For example. a person who has difficulty getting out of bed could commit to putting on an outfit that makes them feel good every morning. even if they do not go out anywhere. or commit to setting their alarm to play their favorite music to motivate them to get out of bed.  she said.  The goal here is to create something that elevates and improves your mood. lowers your sense of dread and sadness. and limits potential stressors. Eventually. you can build up to bigger activities like organizing a social gathering or pursuing a major project at work. 3. Minimize the negative behaviors.As you identify and implement the behaviors that positively impact your mood. you should also take note of which ones don t bring you joy or fulfillment.  Reduce behaviors that make you feel bad.  Vermani said.  For example. someone may choose to limit the amount of time they spend on social media. and replace this with connecting one-on-one with friends. By getting rid of unneeded and unhelpful behaviors. you can increase self-esteem and self-confidence. 4. Don t confuse behavioral activation with busyness. Behavioral activation can sometimes be misunderstood to mean that being busy is the way to combat depression.  Dornhecker said.  Busyness for busyness  sake is not what helps someone feel motivated ― in fact. this can lead to burnout. She noted that some of the activities that are valuable in combating mental health symptoms involve being busy ― for instance. learning a new skill. But other helpful activities can be slow and relaxing. like spending time outside or sipping coffee as you listen to music. 5. Use the technique in combination with other coping strategies.Remember that behavioral activation is just one of many tools involved in cognitive behavioral therapy. It doesn t necessarily work for everyone. and that s OK. Although some people may respond well to behavioral changes alone. others may need a mixture of therapies to help.  Vermani said.  When behavioral activation alone does not help with a person s symptoms. a mental health professional may be able to treat the condition more holistically in partnership with their medical team. ,Health News
The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to expand health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans — less than a week after more than two dozen Republicans blocked it and drew outrage from the veterans  community. comedian Jon Stewart and others.The Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act. or the PACT Act. passed in a 86-11 vote. It now heads to President Joe Biden s desk to be signed into law.It should have passed the Senate last week. A similar version of the PACT Act passed the Senate in June. in an 84-14 vote. It s not particularly controversial: It would allow soldiers. sailors and airmen exposed to pits of burnt waste in combat zones to be covered by the Veterans Affairs health care system for related illnesses. Many of these vets got sick from exposure to burn pits during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.But last Wednesday. right after the news broke that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had struck a deal on a massive tax and climate change package. 25 Republicans unexpectedly blocked the PACT Act despite previously voting to advance it. It made no sense. except in the context of Republicans having a full-blown tantrum about a Democratic deal they didn t like and taking out their anger on a totally unrelated veterans bill.led the GOP effortThe GOP vote to block the bill spurred veterans to show up outside the Capitol in protest. some of whom had been camped outside of the building for days. Stewart. who has advocated on behalf of veterans for years. joined them and tore into Republicans as  stab-vets-in-the-back senators. If this is America first. then America is fucked.  Stewart fumed.But on Tuesday. Republicans folded and agreed to move forward on the bill on the condition that they could get votes on three GOP amendments. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wanted to reduce aid to other countries to help pay for the PACT Act. Toomey wanted to classify funding for the PACT Act as discretionary versus mandatory. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) wanted to shift veterans care into private community care.All of the amendments failed.Just before the bill passed. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). the bill s sponsor. tweeted a video of Stewart hugging him and thanking him outside the Capitol for getting the bill done. My man. pots and pans!  Stewart shouted at Tester.  You brought this thing through and you made this happen.  he said. walking with his arm around the senator.  And these guys know that. and they appreciate it. ,Health News

I recently attended a meeting made up of mostly men and by the end of it. I was feeling invincible. I had held my own in our debates. successfully rebutting some of their points. and I even had them questioning their own biases. Feeling on top of the world. I stood up to network with the other attendees and there. against the cream chair I d sat on. was a damning smear of red period blood. My previous victories were immediately forgotten and embarrassment thrummed through my veins. I had taken precautions ― how could this happen? I tried to be covert. but it was too late. The whole room had seen it. I made a swift exit with apologies to the host. but the mortification remained. I was so humiliated. I cried actual tears over this natural bodily function. Days afterwards the memory would continue to catch me off guard. and the shame would flood in all over again. As someone who is not particularly self-conscious. I analyzed why I was so triggered by this event. and I realized this shame is something I ve battled with for most of my life. When I was 9. I migrated to the U.K. from Nigeria. and this was the first time I d lived with my mother since I was 4. Puberty was not something we spoke about openly in my home. so when it began. I wasn t in any way ready. I recall my breasts materializing almost overnight when I was in primary school. and girls in my class whispered that I was stuffing my chest. The very suggestion was abhorrent to me. it made me want to rip off my jumper. and show them that it was all mine. whether I liked it or not ― and I certainly did not.As the new kid from Africa. I felt like a fish out of water and being the only student in school with fully formed breasts only served to make me the subject of more ridicule and gossip. which isolated me even further. My experience with menstruating proved to be an extension of this feeling. My first period was dreadful. I recall waking up and heading to shower only to be met with a pool of brown sludge in my underwear. An internal meltdown immediately ensued. I had overheard enough conversations to deduce that this was my period. but I was completely unprepared. My mother was essentially a stranger to me. and I was too embarrassed to tell my dad. so I resorted to dealing with it alone. I knew skipping school wasn t an option (my parents would never allow that). so I loaded my underwear with tissue and free bled. It was icky. uncomfortable and made my skin crawl. I remember walking into primary school next to a girl who looked up at her mother and said.  Mummy. she stinks.  I was absolutely mortified. but I couldn t go home. so I forged through the day trying to make myself invisible. My secret was finally discovered days later when my mother found my blood-stained underwear in the wash. While I had quietly hoped that she would hug me and reassure me that everything was going to be okay. instead she interrogated me about why I hadn t told her what had happened. The hurt and shame seared into me. She followed up by providing pads and period advice. but by this point I was ready to be done with the entire thing. This was my initiation into menstruation. As I got older. I got better at managing my period. My cycle was relatively painless. so my strategy was to ignore it as much as possible. yet my general aversion to the subject persisted. To combat this. my friends and I would nickname our periods. avoiding technical terms like  menstruation.  and instead opting for cliche alternatives like  aunt flo.  All the while I was inadvertently absorbing messaging that periods were taboo. which was affirmed by the actions of the culture and adults around me. On TV. I never saw period products advertised with anything resembling blood ― it was always a blue gel. In school. when we began sex education. the boys and girls were separated. which implied that boys were not required to know the details of female anatomy. In addition. I often heard the phrase  she must be on her period  thrown around as an insult. further supporting the notion that periods are bad. Because of what I d learned. I was part of propagating this belief. Whenever my friends and I needed to go to the toilet to change our period products. we would sneak them in our blazer sleeves as though they were contraband. When I needed to purchase period supplies. I opted for the longer self-checkout line over the shorter cashier queue to avoid other people seeing what I was buying. I had internalized all of the negative things I had seen and heard about menstruating. and I was trapped in the grip of our society s ― and my own ― period shaming. When I began to date and became sexually active. conversations about menstruation were unavoidable. but it took a lot for me to feel comfortable enough in my relationships to talk about it. With time. this became easier. and I realized that some men were open to being educated. but others were committed to staying ignorant. Still. I was proud of myself for broaching the topic with them. and I believed I was making some progress with my period shame.Then it happened: I had the most traumatic period experience of my life. heavyI decided to try my luck at the school. Mortified. I explained my situation to a male guard. but he refused to let me use the toilet. Panicking. I pleaded that he could escort me to the bathroom and back. but his answer remained no. A little part inside of me broke. Hyperventilating. I called my team leader and explained my humiliating predicament. Thankfully. she was understanding. She drove me to the nearest pub. but unfortunately their toilets didn t have any period product dispensers. I cleaned up as best as I could under the circumstances and used a hoodie to cover the stain. This was one of my first jobs. and I was eager to meet my quota. so rather than wasting the whole day. I chose to continue working. In hindsight. this was the wrong choice.Our job was to knock on doors and tell people about the charity. Despite my period unexpectedly arriving and bleeding through my pants. things were going well until a couple invited me into their completely white living room. They offered me a chair and despite refusing to sit. they persisted until it got so extremely awkward. I perched on the floor. By the time I finished delivering my rushed presentation and stood up to leave. I had a strong feeling I had left a stain. but I had been through too much to explain my predicament to one more person ― much less these strangers ― so I left without looking back. My mind s-eye vision of them discovering the stained carpet is a recurring nightmare that lives rent free in my head.While these instances may sound like scenes from a movie. they are my reality and the reality of many women and people who menstruate. They happen more frequently than we talk about and due to the stigma in our society surrounding menstruation. we are shamed into silence. This silence is made even more damaging because it breeds a lack of education and perhaps if we were more open about it. my younger self wouldn t have had such a traumatizing transition into womanhood. Yet. I am beginning to recognize that we are all complicit in this culture of silence. It is only in the last year that I have finally been able to tell someone about the incident at my job and even the act of writing this article has been extremely uncomfortable. which reminds me just how deeply ingrained period shame is in me. Despite how much I have grown. incidents like the meeting I mentioned at the beginning of this piece remind me of how negatively I can still sometimes feel about my period. and by extension. myself. However. these incidents also motivate me to do whatever I can to help eradicate period shame. both personally and for our society. I am more committed than ever to speak more openly about menstruation ― including writing about my own experiences on a very public site like this one ― and undertake simple tasks that subvert period shame. like not hiding my period products and questioning habits and behaviors that stigmatize periods. I now notice when books and tv shows overlook the fact that women menstruate. or when establishments don t provide adequate access to period supplies. It is only when we see and challenge these erasures that things will change. and thankfully. they are slowly changing. Social media has been a great tool in accelerating the progress and due to the work of candid creators like @theperioddoctor and many others. I continue to learn more about my period. Nevertheless. in a society where half of the population menstruates. it is not only the responsibility of those who menstruate to normalize periods. it everyone s responsibility to help destigmatize them.

TOPEKA. Kan. (AP) — Kansas on Tuesday will hold the nation s first test of voter feelings about the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. with people throughout the state deciding whether to allow their conservative Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion.the proposed anti-abortion amendmentRepublicansDemocratswouldn t say before the votesurge in early voting At what level does the insanity stop?  said Eric Sheffler. a 60-year-old retired Army officer and Democrat who cast a  no  vote early in the Kansas City suburbs.  What will they try to control next? The Kansas measure would add language to the state constitution saying that it doesn t grant a right to abortion. which would allow lawmakers to regulate it as they see fit. Kentucky will vote in November on adding similar language to its constitution.Meanwhile. Vermont will decide in November whether to add an abortion rights provision to its constitution. A similar question is likely headed to the November ballot in Michigan.a state Supreme Court decision in 2019Both sides together have spent more than $14 million on their campaigns. Abortion providers and abortion rights groups were key donors for the  no  side. while Catholic dioceses heavily funded the  yes  campaign. I just feel like people have become so nonchalant about abortion. like it s just another method of birth control.  said Michelle Mulford. a 50-year-old Kansas City-area teacher and Republican who voted early for the proposed amendment. adding that she supports exceptions to an abortion ban for cases of rape. incest or life-threatening pregnancies.Even though some early voters favor banning nearly all abortions. the vote yes campaign pitched its measure as a way to restore lawmakers  power to set  reasonable  abortion limits and preserve existing restrictions.Kansas doesn t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy. But a law that would prohibit the most common second-trimester procedure and another that would set special health regulations for abortion providers remain on hold because of legal challenges.Stan Ellsworth. a 69-year-old Republican retiree in the Kansas City area. said the argument that voting yes means an abortion ban is  crap.  I haven t talked to a single person who wants that.  he said after voting yes early in the Kansas City suburbs.  Most will accept reasonable exceptions and I think the other side knows that s true. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre weighed in on the Kansas vote Monday. saying:  If it passes. tomorrow s vote in Kansas could lead to another state eliminating the right to choose and eviscerating access to health care. The Republican-controlled Legislature has had anti-abortion majorities since the early 1990s. Kansas hasn t gone further in restricting abortion because abortion opponents have felt constrained either by past federal court decisions or because the governor was a Democrat. like Gov. Laura Kelly. who was elected in 2018.Kelli Kolich. a 35-year-old Kansas City-area pizza restaurant operator and unaffiliated voter. said she voted no because she believes people have a fundamental right to make their own health care choices and expects a yes vote to  eliminate that right.  Women would not have the ability to determine the best choices for themselves.  she said after voting early. as she played with her 18-month-old son.___Stafford reported from Overland Park and Olathe.,Health News
abortionlegislationTim KaineKyrsten SinemaSusan CollinsLisa MurkowskiThe bill unveiled Monday would allow states to ban abortion only after a physician determines that the fetus could survive outside the womb. which typically happens at around 24 weeks of pregnancy. In lieu of enforcing a firm cutoff date. the bill would task a patient s health care provider with making a determination about fetal viability.For now. the effort is more symbolic than anything else.  My colleagues and I have introduced this bipartisan bill today demonstrating that there s now bipartisan support and majority support in the United States Senate to protect reproductive freedom for all.  Kaine said on the Senate floor Monday. DemocratsRepublicans I m very well aware. as are my co-sponsors in introducing that bill. that we do not have the votes today. should it be put up. to get 60 votes in the Senate.  he said.passedBill co-sponsors Collins and Murkowski did not support a previous attempt in the Senate to codify Roe v. Wade s abortion protections. nor did Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).A coalition of more than a dozen abortion rights groups responded to the legislation with disappointment. saying its text is not clear enough. Roe v. WadeNancy Northup. president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. pointed out that this new bill  does not prohibit the citizen-enforced bans which. even before the Dobbs decision. shut down the clinics in Oklahoma and limited Texas clinics to providing only up to six weeks of pregnancy.  What we need from the bill s sponsors is a commitment to end the filibuster to pass abortion rights legislation that will meaningfully restore access to abortion throughout the nation.  she said in a statement. referring to the current Senate rules that allow Republicans to easily stop a bill from coming to a vote unless 60 senators vote to advance it.,Health News
DOVER. Del. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed against Delaware government officials who recalled a vanity license plate issued to a breast cancer survivor because of what the state transportation secretary described as a  perceived profanity. The judge said in a ruling that the lawsuit by Kari Lynn Overington of Milton raises a  significant constitutional issue.  I am ready for my day in court.  Overington. 41. said in a brief phone interview.In December 2020. Overington applied for a vanity license plate reading  FCANCER  and received it two months later.In June 2021. she received a letter from the manager of the Division of Motor Vehicles office in Dover telling her that the plate  does not represent the division and the state in a positive manner.  DMV manager Levi Fisher wrote that any plate considered offensive will be denied or recalled. if issued in error.Overington responded by emailing state Transportation Secretary Nicole Majeski and asking for her help. She argued that the average person would not consider her vanity tag to be obscene. She also said court rulings in other states suggest that First Amendment rights apply to vanity tags. and that any regulations must be  viewpoint neutral.  My vanity plate receives positive feedback everywhere I go. and I have had more than a few deep conversations with complete strangers about my cancer and how cancer has touched their lives because of it.  Overington wrote.  The community of cancer warriors. cancer survivors. and those who love them is far reaching and very supportive. Majeski stood by the decision to recall the vanity plate. saying officials must ensure that they are not approving license tags that contain  obscenity. vulgarity. profanity. hate speech or fighting words.  Your vanity plate FCANCER contains a perceived profanity. the abbreviation for the word  F(asterisk)@k . and for that reason. it must be recalled.  Majeski wrote. apologizing for the oversight by DMV staff in initially approving the plate.Overington then asked DOT officials to seek input from Gov. John Carney. In other states the governor has gotten involved in these cases and the person was able to keep their vanity tags.  she wrote.  I d be disappointed if Governor Carney was not willing to at least consider stepping in. especially given his work with the Delaware Cancer Consortium and his connection to Beau Biden and the entire Biden family. Joe BidenOverington noted in a later email that there are plenty of other  F  words in the English language. including  freedom  and that her license tag did not actually spell the word about which DMV officials were concerned. She also pointed out that the DMV itself has used implied profanity on electronic signs advising motorists to drive safely. Those messages include  Get your head out of your Apps  and  Oh Cell No. DMV Director Jana Simpler stood fast. however. insisting that Overington could no longer display the vanity tag.Overington responded by filing a lawsuit last year. claiming that the state officials had violated her First Amendment rights by imposing content-based and viewpoint-based restrictions on her speech.State officials sought to dismiss the complaint. arguing that it failed to state a a proper claim and that the defendants — Fisher. Simpler and Majeski — have qualified immunity against claims raised against them in their individual capacities. This lawsuit is one of those instances where an individual seeks to push the boundaries of what DMV will permit to be displayed on a vanity license plate. to allow the display of profanity.  an attorney for the state wrote.Judge Richard Andrews denied the dismissal motion and granted a motion by Overington to amend her complaint to clarify that the defendants were being sued in their official. not individual. capacities.Citing a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Andrews wrote that challenges to laws that burden free expression are permitted when a licensing statute places  unbridled discretion in the hands of a government official. Andrews also noted that. while Overington has represented herself well without a lawyer. the constitutional issue in dispute should be decided through a process that includes lawyers on both sides. He said he would ask the court clerk whether an attorney could be obtained as a  friend of the court  supporting Overington s position.A spokesman for the Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.,Health News

This morning. as could be anticipated. his SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing remained positive. The letter also stated Biden will continue  strict isolation measures as previously described. The New York Times  Peter Baker saidBiden is having  lingering minor symptoms.  including a  dry cough and sniffles.  according to the White House.HuffPost has reached out to The White House for more information.Biden tested positive for COVID-19 a second time on Saturday. He first tested positive for the virus on July 21tested negative O Connor said Biden s symptoms when he first tested positive included a runny nose. fatigue and a dry cough.In a memo sent Saturday. O Connor described Biden s second positive diagnosis as a  rebound  case affecting a small percentage of individuals treated with Paxlovidan antiviral medication that stops the coronavirus from replicating in the body. After testing negative on Tuesday evening. Wednesday morning. Thursday morning. and Friday morning. the President tested positive late Saturday morning. by antigen testing.  O Connor said.  This in fact represents ‘rebound positivity.

 You have an ectopic pregnancy.  my doctor told me. I felt the energy leave my body like a balloon deflating.My doctor went on to explain that the embryo could not move out of my fallopian tube. and without treatment. the ectopic pregnancy would result in the tube rupturing with life-threatening bleeding.  It needs to be treated immediately.  she added. firmly.I d felt an intense. stabbing pain on the side of my stomach earlier that day at work. It was so severe that it caused my knees to buckle beneath me at my desk. I felt light-headed and on the verge of passing out. As this feeling waned. I tried to focus on typing. But then another dizzy spell hit. And then another.  I don t think this is good.  I remember thinking.I told my manager I wasn t feeling well. and I drove myself to the doctor. My doctor confirmed I had an ectopic pregnancy. Coupled with the pain was the disappointment that this was my third nonviable pregnancy. To trigger a miscarriage. my doctor gave me two shots of methotrexate in the butt and prescribed several weeks of rest. The medical term for ending a pregnancy. even a nonviable one. is abortion. I only took one more day off of work. and I told my immediate manager what was happening. and they were understanding and supportive.Instead of joining my family for holiday skiing. I hung out in the base lodge. The rest of my Christmas holiday consisted of follow-up doctor appointments to ensure my hCG levels were dropping. which indicated the pregnancy was dissolving.I hadn t told anyone at work I was pregnant. nor would I tell them I had to terminate that pregnancy. At the time. I couldn t fathom sharing my fertility struggles with my employers. Dealing with the emotional rollercoaster of failed pregnancies was difficult enough with my then-husband and I. The last thing I wanted to do was add my co-workers or bosses into the mix of grief and disappointment. I was devastated about losing yet another pregnancy. This manifested as feeling totally numb. emotionally. Thankfully. I went on a two-week Christmas break a few days after the miscarriage. While I wanted to keep my fertility struggles private. a part of me also wished I could reach out to my colleagues for support.A couple of years and one divorce later. I started my IVF journey with my current husband. At this point. I was running my own business. and I chose to keep my fertility journey private. again. When I started my IVF journey. I had no idea how disruptive it would be. It included multiple pills every morning. a patch that I wore during the day. different medications that I had to mix and inject in my stomach every night. and regular (unpredictable) monitoring appointments. I was running my business at the time. and undergoing IVF meant that I had to say no to thousands of dollars in potential income and risk losing professional relationships. I worried that I d be seen as a less capable leader and business partner because I found myself turning down opportunities. rescheduling clients at the last minute and failing to support my business partners due to unpredictable IVF monitoring appointments.In my work as a leadership coach. many of my clients have shared that they faced increased scrutiny when their pregnancy or fertility struggles were brought to their co-workers and employers  attention. One of my friends chose to tell her boss — who she viewed as an ally — about her IVF appointments. While he expressed initial verbal support. whenever she had an IVF appointment. he communicated annoyance at being inconvenienced. Another client recently told me that she was reported to HR for  drug use  on company grounds while administering her IVF shots at work. During a process that should be treated with sensitivity. this client had to defend herself to her bosses and co-workers. and she was subjected to routine drug testing.A study conducted by the American Psychological Association shows that discrimination against women employees starts the moment she announces that she is pregnant. Women in the study reported experiencing microaggressions such as hostility. reduced eye contact and being cut off. While more than half of working mothers experience workplace discrimination. only a quarter of fathers report experiencing this.Choosing to keep my struggles with fertility private made the most sense for me and my family. It is also a choice that I believe everyone should have across the spectrum of reproductive care — including abortion care.In light of Roe v Wade being overturned — many companies including Netflix. Yelp. Starbucks. PayPal and Microsoft — have agreed to cover travel costs for employees to get abortion care in a different state. (Buzzfeed. HuffPost s parent company. also has a similar provision for its employees.)I believe this comes from a well-intentioned place of advocacy. But I worry about how this will play out since relying on company-provided benefits places the emotional burden and exposure on pregnant people to come forward and ask for these benefits.In theory. claims could be handled through the insurance provider and employees wouldn t needto tell their employers about requiring the abortion travel benefit. but there are other ways the company can find out. While many companies are promising confidentiality. a Jezebel article reported that at Citi. employees will need to apply for leave. pay for the travel and abortion costs out of pocket and apply for reimbursement from insurance. In many workplaces. employers will question the reason for the leave. The chief compliance and privacy officer at Favor. Michi McClure. further explained to Business Insider that businesses are obligated to ensure the funds are being spent as intended — and this is not possible without the employee disclosing the purpose of these funds. It s not difficult to imagine the type of scrutiny and microaggressions employees who choose to rely on company-provided abortion care could be vulnerable to. Qualitative studies done by the Women s Health Issues journal found that abortion stigma in the workplace led to fears around disclosure. social judgment. social isolation and discrimination. This can adversely affect employees who have managers or bosses that are either unsympathetic or have a moral opposition to abortions. As someone who struggled to communicate miscarriages and IVF to her colleagues. I can t imagine the amount of psychological safety required to tell a leader why I needed a few days off for medical travel reasons. I will repeat: I believe that the intention behind these benefits comes from a place of advocacy. But placing the onus on women and people with uteruses to come forward and ask for this care adds to the existing burdens that women specifically and historically have had in the workplace. (Obviously. trans people also face their own set of challenges at work.) Being forced to take leave and possibly facing scrutiny (or worse) from employers could impact women employees  ability to advance in the workplace.Because people in the United States primarily access health insurance through their employers. it s time for organizations to reconsider their approach to supporting these team members through their entire reproductive cycles. So much of a woman s quality of life is related to the health of her reproductive system. and therefore it only makes sense that women (and anyone with a uterus) have full access to an entire spectrum of reproductive-related care. This should include the times when — for a variety of reasons that are only the business of the pregnant person. possibly their partner and their doctor — this care includes needing an abortion. Ultimately. I want to live in a world that embraces medical privacy and equal reproductive healthcare. and where anyone can easily access this healthcare without fear of judgment or scrutiny.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

We know that big life changes ― layoffs. health events. a new baby ― can cause a lot of stress. However. there are also tiny shifts in our lives (and even our days!) that are often overlooked when it comes to anxiety. Maybe you dread lying down in bed for the night. or maybe the morning rush has you stressed out.These are called  micro-transitions.  which experts define as smaller moments where something is ending and another event is starting. These can include little points in your day. like the aforementioned bedtime. or slightly bigger events. like a vacation ending.  Whether it s called triggers or micro-triggers. we all certainly have things that set us off.  said Jeff Temple. a psychologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. who adds that sometimes even dreading those transitions can be triggering.  There s anticipatory anxiety. which is anxiety about being anxious. as opposed to actual things to be anxious about. Whether you ve been officially diagnosed with anxiety or just feel stressed in those moments. there are ways to identify which micro-transitions are toughest for you and strategies for coping. Here are some micro-transitions to watch out for and what to do to counteract them:Dark thoughts like to show their ugly faces at night. Temple said. so the sun going down or similar evening-related transitions can trigger anxiety. One study found that sleep disruption can be caused by an inability to control emotionally negative information at night. Some psychologists blame our caveman-esque brains. which used to scan for danger before bed in hunter-gatherer times. Additionally. our brains  active  negativity bias  ― where our minds subconsciously focus on bad news over good news ― can be at play. At night. we can reminisce on various negative events that occurred during the day.Maybe you ve spent weeks preparing for your upcoming vacation with family. only to obsess over your last day as the end of your trip is approaching. Temple said this can be caused by having a great time and not wanting it to end. or conversely. having high expectations and feeling like whatever happened wasn t as fun as you wanted it to be.  So therefore. there s a sense of dread or let down.  he said. These emotions can materialize as anxiety that you wouldn t have felt otherwise.Do you change how you are parenting when your partner leaves the room and your mother-in-law walks in? Maybe you are stricter. or more laid-back. Either way. Dr. Whitney Casares. a private practice pediatrician and founder and CEO of the Modern Mamas Club. said that an  audience change  can be a micro-transition that causes anxiety. This can also show up as  putting on a good face  at a party when you aren t up for it. or feeling like you can t be your true self around certain peers.If you have a Zoom call coming up. and you know your kid will be waking from a nap at the same time or that a repair person is about to arrive. you might feel pulled in two directions at once. Or maybe it s a slightly bigger scenario: Say you ve committed to a distant relative s wedding and you get an invitation in the mail for your friend s wedding the same weekend.Dreading this inability to balance obligations or responsibilities can lead to some anxiety around those micro-transitions. Casares explained. Anticipating or worrying about issues that may come up can cause your body to go into fight-or-flight mode.The first step to handling this type of anxiety is identifying the micro-transitions that are triggering to you. which can be easier said than done. Temple explained. Some of the hardest parts are recognizing your negative thoughts. or your anxious thoughts ... it s really difficult. It s about being ― I really hate this word ― mindful and reflective. and paying attention to your body and your thoughts.  he said. suggesting people write it down when they perceive an  automatic thought  popping up.These are thoughts that we don t even notice we are having. like  tonight s going to suck.  or  I m not going to be able to sleep tonight because I have to do this tomorrow.  Once we can recognize which thoughts are automatic. we can challenge them. Temple said. That s when you need to back up. and sit down and think about what just happened and what was going on. so then you can figure out what you were thinking.  he said. When you do this. you ll start to notice a certain time of day. activity or anything in your environment that s causing your anxiety.Once you know your micro-transition triggers. you can work to prevent them. Then you can approach those transitions in a relaxed state.Temple said. So if. say. the evening is an anxiety-inducing period of time. practicing sitting down and deep breathing as that time begins can help.You can also try creating a designated worry time to help compartmentalize your thoughts. This may be especially useful if you feel anxiety before sleep. Spend 10 minutes sometime in the mid-morning. not right before you go to bed. and write down every single thing that you are worried or anxious about. Stay seated for 10 minutes.  Temple said. Later in the day. if something feels worrisome. validate the thought but move it to that worry time.  We re not saying don t have that thought. because that s impossible ... we re saying you re allowed to think that. you re allowed to be anxious about that. just not right now. So let s make a note and we ll worry about that tomorrow during worry time.  Temple said.Finally. know you are not alone in your anxieties. Casares said. For example. in scenario of a Zoom call while your child is napping.  you could fill a colosseum full of parents who might feel this exact same way.  she said. By realizing anyone in your situation might be experiencing the same emotions. you give your feelings some permission and some room to breathe.,Health News

I was a cancer nurse. I thought I knew what living with cancer was about. Then my 4-year-old son. Brennan. got leukemia.But I m not the  normal  parent.. I should have seen the signs.afterThe leg pains started at Halloween. Cloaked as a ghost. Brennan sat rocking on two legs of the kitchen chair. waving his arms as he talked to Grandma on the phone about the first bag of Halloween candy he was old enough to remember. He didn t tell her about the leg pains that had flickered on and off throughout the day. so maybe they weren t so bad.Then came the fevers. and on some days. the sharp abdominal pain around his belly button. both always gone after 12 hours. It was easy to ignore symptoms that went away. By Christmas. the purple velvet robe he wore. as the King carrying frankincense to baby Jesus in the preschool reenactment. dwarfed his rail-thin body. Even his smile was crooked in the picture. I started to worry. His pediatrician could find nothing wrong.We expected this to be the last Christmas with my father. so we drove to my family home two hours away. where Brennan curled into a fetal position all day to assuage the pain. That evening. he insisted on trying out his new ice skates. a coveted Christmas gift. He fell. got up. and fell again. over and over. until he threw up his hands and shouted.  I can t do this anymore!  We didn t know then that his hemoglobin was half of what it should have been. and there wasn t enough oxygen to feed his muscles.Back home in the new year. we resumed our routines ― until one morning. when his hand shook like an old man s as he showed me his Lego figure. He scrunched his brow. averted his eyes and silently. swiftly pulled the toy back and tucked it into the pocket of his sweatpants. Neither of us said a word. I wish that I had swooped him up in my arms. held him close and asked him how he was feeling. Instead. I gave him a quick. reassuring hug and set off for work. Our nanny paged me at noon. concerned.  Make me an appointment.  I said. relieved to be taking action.Brennan s leukemia took two months and nine days to progress to the point where it could be detected in a routine blood test. This didn t affect his prognosis. But waiting one more day might have. and it would have put him in a higher risk category. requiring even more aggressive treatment.Within six days. acute lymphoblastic leukemia was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. We enrolled Brennan in a clinical trial with 2.000 other children. a central line port-a-cath was surgically placed to inject chemotherapy. and he started induction therapy. the first phase of what would be 38 months of treatment.mom do.The first day in the hospital. he drew a house with a smiling figure huddled alone in the attic. Outside. a large. blue body reached between red spears jutting from the thick. black roof.  It s a birdhouse.  he told me.  There is a little yellow bird inside. There is a warning to stay away. Two days later he added lights and toys outside.  To look pretty for Mom.  he said. His little yellow bird still hovered in the attic. splattered with red dots. signifying all the pokes it had endured.  The window is the only way in.  Brennan whispered in my ear. giving him some imagined control in his new world.In that first year of intense treatment. I collected a portfolio of his pictures. He drew his bones with a heart and brain. so they would feel love and know how to  make the right kinds of cells.  He outlined a figure in black and purple. showcasing his own anger bursting to escape. and he gave the Headless Horseman a candle  to help him find his way.  By summer. he drew a flower. standing straight and tall amid the rain and swirls around it. Over the year. my son found courage and strength. despite the invasive. fatiguing treatments and the chaos in his young life.doingA decade after the treatment ended. I had a dream in which Brennan died. Friends of his without faces handed me a horse. a dog. a basketball. a football. All stuffed. All white. All memories. I didn t want them. I didn t accept them. But I took them. My hands. like robots. dropped each one onto a pile on the white painted ledge of the bay window. I turned back to take the next gift. as if the rhythm of moving back and forth would keep me alive. The next day I saw his body in a coffin in a cloud on top of the hill.one of 500.000 in the United StatesWhatever we face — cancer. pandemic. death or some other crisis — there can be a temptation to bury our emotions to avoid feeling the discomfort in the moment (for whatever reason). If we do this. we can hide those feelings from our awareness. but not from our subconscious. Emotions encode themselves in the brain s limbic system. where motivation. long-term memory and the sense of smell reside. The feelings resurface when triggered by a memory. an odor or a new related event. Ultimately. it takes more energy to suppress and control emotions than it does to just feel them in the moment.When my dream woke me up. my son was scheduled for a routine tonsillectomy. On the 15th anniversary of his leukemia diagnosis. I sat alone in the muted surgical waiting room and stared at a black heart in the abstract picture on the wall. Fears blurred into one. Memories flooded back. and a torrent of tears caught up with time.It was time to face my fears of losing my son — to feel them. make sense of them and then let them go. But how?Some people talk. I started writing. I wrote in the pages of journals. on my computer. on notes scattered here and there. And then I wrote a memoir to make sense of all the scattered thoughts — and feelings. Writing down my thoughts allowed my feelings to show up on the page. separate from my body. Once they had an identity. my cognitive mind could make sense of them. analyze them and find ways to deal with them.Writing was my first step into awareness. Expressive writing. pioneered by the social psychologist James Pennebaker. is a therapeutic technique of writing about an experience to discover emotional meaning and gain perspective. Writing required patience. effort. time and fortitude. but I felt driven to understand and make sense of events so I could release the hold they had on my psyche. It was safe now. The risk of relapse was behind us.Still. it was hard. I had to recreate. relive and process all those feelings I d avoided for the sake of getting through. I learned to be gentle with myself. to forgive myself. to honor the fact that I was a mom with feelings. (Kristin Neff calls this  self-compassion. ) In the process of looking back. of reliving the events surrounding my son s leukemia. I learned to face my fears. let go of my expectations for myself — and the guilt at not recognizing his symptoms — and be present in the moment. the one I was living now. Forgetting doesn t heal. remembering does. There is no training to be a cancer mom. I had to learn to live from my heart as well as my head.Janice Post-White is a cancer nurse. researcher. writer and mother of a childhood cancer survivor. Her memoir.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has the legal authority to provide abortions and abortion counseling to hundreds of thousands of female veterans and spouses of veterans ― and it should  immediately  begin doing so. more than two dozen Democratic senators argued in a Thursday letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough.The Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade  removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country. including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant.  reads the letter. signed by half of the Senate Democratic Caucus.  This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled.  Thus. the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rule-making to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.  the senators wrote.Current federal regulations bar the VA from providing any abortion-related services. Beyond that. CHAMPVA. the department s insurance program for certain dependents and survivors of veterans. only offers abortion services in cases where the mother s life is in danger. But McDonough has the authority to change all of these regulations through the rule-making process ― and the senators say he should do so. now. The VA s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary ‘shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed  to certain veterans.  the senators  letter says.  Importantly. the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services. even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.  We call on you to take swift and decisive action to ensure all of our veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can access abortions and all abortion-related services.  they conclude.The letter is signed by Democratic Sens. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii). Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). Tammy Baldwin (Wis.). Michael Bennet (Colo.). Richard Blumenthal (Conn.). Cory Booker (N.J.). Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.). Tammy Duckworth (Ill.). Dick Durbin (Ill.). Dianne Feinstein (Calif.). Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). John Hickenlooper (Colo.). Angus King (I-Maine). Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). Ed Markey (Mass.). Patty Murray (Wash.). Alex Padilla (Calif.). Jack Reed (R.I.). Jacky Rosen (Nev.). Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Tina Smith (Minn.). Chris Van Hollen (Md.). Raphael Warnock (Ga.). Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).Here s a copy of their letter:Hirono. who co-led the letter with Warren. said the  chaos  created by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade means that it s time to revisit longstanding regulations for reproductive health care. The VA policy in particular. she said. is ripe for change. As far as I m concerned. I would like the secretary to act now.  Hirono told HuffPost.McDonough himself said he believes he has the authority to change this policy during an April hearing before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. which took place before the fall of Roe v. Wade. He danced around saying whether he d actually do it. though. Our statute would allow us to provide abortion services. We do not provide abortion services pursuant to rule-making.  McDonough said.  At the moment. I don t have anything to report on such a policy change. When Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) followed up to clarify whether the law permits McDonough to change VA policy to allow for veterans to have access to abortions and abortion counseling. he replied:  The law does permit it. Does. Frankel. puzzled. asked why he wasn t already trying to change the policy. It s not been VA policy now for several decades.  McDonough said.  I have just not changed what is existing VA policy across Republican and Democratic administrations for decades.  Well. I would urge you to consider that.  Frankel replied.On Thursday. HuffPost asked Hirono about McDonough not appearing particularly ready to change the VA s abortion policy during his testimony in the April hearing. Well. if you acknowledge you have the authority to do it. expect people like me. Elizabeth [Warren] and others to say ‘Go do it.   she said.Warren. similarly. told HuffPost on Friday that just because a rule has been on the books for a long time doesn t mean it s a good one. For decades and across administrations. women s reproductive health has too often been an afterthought at the VA.  she said.  With this extremist Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe. the VA must step up and exercise its authority to provide full health care services to all veterans. including abortion. If McDonough ultimately did change the VA s abortion policy. it would still leave the question of what happens to female veterans who live in states that have banned abortions. Nearly 400.000 female veterans of reproductive age live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions in the wake of Roe v. Wade s demise.But Hirono said that shouldn t matter. because the health care services provided by the federal government are not something states can regulate. We can t have the states telling the federal government what to do and what kind of services to provide.  said the Hawaii senator. who is also an attorney.  I acknowledge it does raise a legal issue. but it s one that we should take on. She didn t seem particularly concerned about McDonough s seeming indifference to the VA s abortion policy during the April hearing. My experience with Secretary McDonough is that he is a doer.  Hirono said.  And so. my hope is that this letter will spur him to act. A VA spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether McDonough is considering changing the VA s abortion policy.,Health News
COVID-19authorized emergency useonly 30%authorized in June for ages 6 months to 4 yearsKaiser Family Foundation (KFF) COVID-19 Vaccine MonitorThe survey also asked parents to explain their reluctance to having their children vaccinated. We presented some of their most common concerns to medical experts to see how they would address them with parents. Here s what they had to say:The No. 1 concern raised by vaccine-hesitant parents in the KFF survey was that the vaccine is  too new.  or has not undergone enough research or testing. The vaccine isn t new. This has been around for some time.  said Dr. Amesh Adalja. senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.Dr. Ruth Kanthula. a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at MedStar Health. explained several factors that led to the COVID vaccine s relatively quick development. While you may not have heard of it before the pandemic. the mRNA technology scientists used to create the vaccine was discovered in the 1960s. During the COVID-19 pandemic. there was a large infusion of funds to support clinical trials for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.  Kanthula said. The increased funds allowed research programs to hire more staff to work across multiple sites and to help manufacture the vaccines. Additionally. clinical trials were able to recruit a large number of study participants. including children. in a short period of time. This allowed for vaccine safety and efficacy data to be reviewed sooner than past vaccine trials. Adalja also pointed out that newness isn t a reliable proxy for danger.  Just because something is new. that s not evidence that it s unsafe.  he said. adding that we don t hesitate to purchase the newest version of the iPhone over safety concerns.  At some point. every piece of technology that improved human life was new.  Adalja said.No one wants to see their child in pain or discomfort. but side effects like fever and soreness at the injection site are fairly common after many vaccines. These can happen with the COVID-19 shot and tend to pass quickly. myocarditis He explained that illnesses such as rotovirus and chickenpox also rarely cause severe illness. yet we routinely vaccinate against these diseases.And just because cases are generally mild doesn t mean issues can t happen. When infections with the omicron variant surged last winter. so did pediatric hospitalizations. Nine in 10 children ages 5-11 who were hospitalized during the omicron wave were not vaccinated ― meaning their hospitalizations were likely preventable.  Yes. children tend to get milder infections.  said Kanthula.  However. children are still at risk for severe infection requiring hospitalization. supplement oxygen and possible intubation ― placement of a breathing tube.  Furthermore.  pediatricians are limited with regards to the medications we can use to treat COVID-19 infection in children.  Kanthula added. Treatments such as Paxlovid and monoclonal antibodies are only approved for ages 12 and up. MISC-Crecent studyYou many have heard people talking about their vaccinated children becoming infected with COVID-19. While it s true that a child. or an adult. may still test positive for COVID after getting vaccinated. this isn t the most important measure of a vaccine s effectiveness.Vaccination offers strong protection against severe disease and complications. If your vaccinated child does get COVID-19. Adalja said.  it s unlikely they re going to need to be hospitalized.  That. he noted. is the true goal of vaccination. What we re really trying to prevent is severe disease.  he said. 75% of children and adolescentsSince infection brings temporary protection against the disease. parents may wonder if it is still worth having their children vaccinated. Experts stress that it is. Hybrid immunity.  meaning from both prior infection and vaccination. is  the best type of immunity to have.  offering the most protection against multiple variants of the disease. Adalja said.Some parents are confused about the varied dosing of children s vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. for example. is given in two 10-microgram doses to children ages 5-11. and in three 3-microgram doses to children 6 months to 4 years. A 4-year-old and a 5-year-old. however. aren t very different in size. and a parent may wonder. for example. if they should wait until their child turns 5 in order to receive the higher dose. But dosing doesn t hinge on a child s weight.  The dosing is based on what is the minimum amount of vaccine dose necessary to gain a sufficient immune response.  said Adalja. who noted that it  took so long for 5-to-11-year-olds because they were trying to get the dosing right  in order to minimize side effects.  As a pediatrician.  said Kanthula.  I know children are not little adults and one vaccine dose does not fit all. Children have different physiologic and immune responses depending on their age.  One of the biggest predictors of whether or not a child gets vaccinated has nothing to do with their health. The KFF survey found that parents who identified as Republican or Republican-leaning were most likely to say they were  definitely not  planning to vaccinate their children.Other parents  concerns were less ideological and more financial or logistical. The survey found that 44% of Black parents with children ages 6 months to 4 years worry about needing to take time away from work to vaccinate their child or care for them if they have side effects. And 45% of Hispanic parents with children of the same ages said they worried about not being able to get their child vaccinated at  a place they trust.  One potentially hopeful finding is that 70% of parents of children ages 6 months to 4 years said that they had not yet spoken to their pediatrician about vaccinating their child. meaning that health care providers may have an opening to allay families  concerns in person when they bring children in for checkups. But there s no need to wait for your annual visit. If you have questions about the vaccine. call your pediatrician and make an appointment to discuss them.,Health News

This is true for the food you buy anywhere. not just viral TikTok products.Partnership for Food Safety EducationThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Those who are pregnant. children under the age of 5. adults 65-plus. and those with a compromised immune system are at higher risk.  Saunier explained.  Food poisoning is no joke and more than just a rough night in the bathroom. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates foodborne illnesses cost $17.6 billion annually in medical expenses. lost productivity and death.Experts also warn about the risk for botulism ― as well as other pathogens like listeria monocytogenes. salmonella and E. coli.Jory LangeConsumers can take steps to minimize the risk of foodborne illness. Below. experts share their advice for determining whether any new food product was created with safety in mind.The USDA oversees meat. poultry and processed egg products. with the FDA regulating the rest of the food world. As a general matter. food producers are required to follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) to help ensure the safety of food.  an FDA spokesperson told HuffPost.  CGMP regulations generally address matters including appropriate personnel hygienic practices. design and construction of a food plant and maintenance of plant grounds. plant equipment. sanitary operations. facility sanitation. and production and process controls during the production of food. There are requirements for pH and water activity to protect against botulism. for example. Labels should be accurate and disclose the presence of allergens. which could be life-threatening to some consumers. Food producers also need to adhere to state and local health department regulations. These regulations vary by food type. and how the food item is provided to the customer.  Saunier explained.  Food producers ― small and large ― are required to be licensed or registered to sell food to the public and comply with all the applicable food safety regulations. Although the government generally requires food manufacturers to produce their products in commercial facilities that have been inspected. most states have  cottage laws  that allow for the sale of food items created in home kitchens.Mindy BrashearsIt s worth noting that cottage laws often require producers to register their products and tend to apply only to low-risk foods like bread. Whenever ordering any food item online. check to see if the manufacturer seems legitimate.  Lange advised.  Do they have a well-made website? Does their website identify the manufacturer. and where it is located? Are the ingredients in the product listed (and spelled correctly)? Does the nutrition label make sense? Do they have a local business license where they are located? Check to see if there s a way to contact the manufacturer and a physical address and phone number. Avoid any food manufacturers who don t want to be contacted by their customers.  Lange said.In your research. see if there s any information about the manufacturing facility. any safety measures in place. delivery methods. ingredient sourcing. allergen information and whether the producer is registered or licensed to sell food.Grocery stores and farmers markets typically require any products they sell to adhere to safety regulations. So. just as you d expect safe production. packaging and labels for common store products. the same should go for food you buy online.establishment number If you re not sure of the safety of the product or you have questions. that s OK.  Saunier said.  Contact the producer before making a purchase and ask questions like. ‘How should I store this product? . ‘What are the safety steps taken in making this product? . ‘What safety steps are taken to ensure safe shipment of the product? . ‘Has this product passed inspection?  and ‘Are you registered/licensed to sell food?  Make a phone call or send an email or direct message on social media to politely inquire about manufacturing facilities and procedures. If they refuse to provide any information or get defensive. that s likely a good sign to stay away.ASI Food Safety We understand that this issue can feel complicated.  Saunier said.  Keep it simple. Identify the state the producer is in and contact that state s department that oversees food production to check if they are authorized to sell. Some of these departments might be called the health department or department of agriculture. for example. If you have further questions. Saunier recommended calling federal food safety regulators like the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) and the FDA s Food and Cosmetic Information Center at 888-SAFEFOOD (888-723-3366).If the food vendor is affiliated with a retail establishment like a restaurant. the city or county health department might be more helpful.Marc SanchezFDA-registered facilities are only inspected about every seven years. according to the Congressional Research Service. and third-party food safety certifications are  time-intensive  and probably  not suited to a company racing to market.  Sanchez said. The U.S. food system relies on trust. but there s no reason that needs to be blind trust.  Sanchez said.  I always encourage my students and friends to be skeptical about food. Look past the marketing hype and make an informed decision about what you re buying. That skepticism should extend to the moment you first try the product. Before you scarf down a new food item. take a moment to examine how it looks. smells and feels.Maggie MichalczykPay attention to the product s packaging and label as you unbox it. The label can tell you how closely the company is paying attention to the regulations.  Sanchez said.  For example. odd serving sizes. all even numbers in the nutrient declarations. a missing U.S. address. a missing allergen declaration ― if simple things like this are overlooked. what s that say about how safely the product is made? experiences symptomsCDC public health gatewayelectronic formconsumer complaint coordinatorBeing skeptical doesn t mean refusing to try new products from small food companies. I am fully supportive of new food products and new items entering the market.  Brashears said.  There are many co-packers who can make the product in a sanitary facility overseen by the FDA to ensure food safety of the final product and to assist in getting label approval. ,Health News
If you check the weather on your phone frequently. you ve probably been seeing lots of orange and red bars on those daily temperature predictions. We don t need to tell you that it s hot out there. But does temperature affect how much sunscreen you need? And. if the UV index is also high. what does that mean for your skin?Even though both the temperature and the UV index can be higher in the summer. meteorologist Sven Sundgaard explained that air temperature and the UV index are not tied to one another directly.  That ‘UV  stands for ultraviolet radiation.  he explained.  The index. which runs from a low of 1 to a high of 11+. is a good indication of how quickly you can get a sunburn. The higher the number. the quicker the burn. so more precautions should be taken.  The index. which is compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). is calculated on a next-day basis for dozens of cities across the United States. The EPA considers 6-7 on the UV index to be  high risk. To track your risk of skin damage. pay attention to the index and the time of day. not necessarily the temperature.  The highest sun angle. or strongest sun. happens midday. which is between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. for most places.  Sundgaard said.  But the high temperature of the day usually occurs between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on a sunny day. You may be most uncomfortable from the heat at 5 p.m.. when it s 95 degrees. but the sun is actually stronger at 11 a.m. and you ll burn more quickly then. You can burn nearly 1.5 times faster at 11 a.m. versus 5 p.m. Angela KimintensityArash AkhavanRebecca MarcusAnd if temperature isn t necessarily a factor. why are there more sunburns during a scorching-hot summer?Nava GreenfieldSandy SkotnickiWondering how the index was developed?  It s calculated using a person with a Fitzpatrick Skin Type 2 as a reference point.  Marcus said.  That s a type of skin that s fair. burns easily and tans minimally. When the UV Index is low. this ‘reference  person would have a low risk of burning when exposed to peak sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for one hour. As the UV index increases. so does the risk. Those index numbers are worth watching. dermatologists said.  The higher the index. the more those damaging rays are penetrating the atmosphere.  Skotnicki said.  Those rays cause oxidation damage to our cellular genetic material and DNA. If you want to check on the UV index but don t have a smartphone handy. try this trick:  If your shadow is taller than you are. the UV index is likely low.  Kim said.  If your shadow is shorter. the UV index is likely high. and you should seek shade and wear sunscreen SPF 30+ or higher. Kim went on to explain that there are three types of UV rays.  UV-C is mostly blocked by the ozone layer. so UV-A and UV-B are the ones we talk most about.  Kim said.  As long as it s light out. UV-A can affect your skin. UV-B generally affects your skin late morning and early afternoon times like 10 a.m. to 4.p.m. According to experts. none of these rays are friends for your skin.  UV-A penetrates deeper into skin. causing hyperpigmentation and lines and wrinkles by breaking down collagen and elastic fibers.  said dermatologist Loretta Ciraldo. founder of Dr. Loretta skin care.  Its role in causing melanoma is also becoming more evident. UV-B specifically causes the death of skin cells in the upper layer of the skin. causing redness. burning and peeling. We believe it s a major cause of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. All this talk of UV radiation made us wonder why sunscreen is our most frequent go-to for protection. What does it do for us. anyway? Sunscreen helps protect the skin from UV damage. which. over time. can lead to skin cancer. hyperpigmentation. melasma. rosacea and premature aging.  dermatologist Nkem Ugonabo explained. We dermatologists actually use the term ‘photoaging  to describe the role UV radiation plays in the development of wrinkles. age spots. rough texture and sagging.  Ciraldo said.  In addition to helping to prevent skin cancer. sunscreen also helps to prevent unwanted aging changes in the face. neck. chest and hands. If you think getting a sunburn now and then is no big deal. think again.  Having even one blistering sunburn can double a person s risk of developing deadly melanoma.  Kim said. Even if you re not seeing damage now. that doesn t mean it won t show up someday.  Some sun damage can be repaired by the skin cells. but. because your skin cells have memory. some damage doesn t become apparent for 10 to 20 years.  Greenfield said.When the UV index is at least 6 or 7. reach for that tube of sunscreen.  It may not be as effective for as long as it typically is when the UV index is very high.  Greenfield said. Heat can play a role in reapplication needs. too.  When it s super-hot out. we need to wear more sunscreen because we re sweating it off.  Kim said. No matter what the season. sunscreen is always a good idea.  It should be applied every day. regardless of whether it ‘feels hot  or not.  Ugonabo said.  Even on cloudy days. up to 80% of the sun s harmful UV rays can penetrate the clouds. ,Health News

The head of the Women s Institute. a government body. said gender stereotypes are at the root of discrimination based on physical appearance. Expectations are projected onto women about how they should look.  Antonia Morillas told state news agency Efe.  That doesn t only affect our self-esteem. it also takes away our rights and limits how we behave in and whether we enjoy public spaces.

Once the suffering catches fire. you can t ignore it. Our relentless pandemic. cruelly paired with escalating white supremacist violence. has killedmore than a million Americans. Faced with such widespread grief. many of us have noticed our mental health deteriorate in unexpected ways. If you re like me. this has also meant confronting the question-turned-grenade of self-judgment: Are you so weak and broken that you require a magic pill to put yourself back together? In a system already built to exhaust us and make us feel disconnected from the ability to change shit. people who were already tired have been pushed to breaking points.  says Shahem Mclaurin. a therapist and social worker based in New York.  But the stigma is really strong when it comes to psychotropic medication being something that deems you ‘less than.  This stigma surrounding antidepressants. and how it manifests in Black communities specifically. is why even when my own pain became so pronounced that I could no longer ignore it. I still insisted on running away from it.I started avoiding the possibility of my depression at the onset of the 2020 lockdowns. when my mother s rare form of cancer ― a cancer that grew perversely in her womb like a hardheaded child ― revealed itself to be terminal. When I moved from New York to North Carolina to care for her. the combined stress of keeping her safe from COVID-19. relocating to another state. planning a wedding and finishing up my book made it evident that I needed to take more drastic steps to safeguard my mental health. Still. I stubbornly refused to consider medication.At one point. I was seeing three different therapists at the same time. I turned further toward spirituality and meditation. I significantly reduced my drinking and my social media use. and invested more into deepening relationships with my family and community. All of this helped. but my mother still died. and there was still this brokenness I couldn t seem to repair.Perhaps it just needed time. my shame told me. And so. a few months after my mother s passing. I started a new job that required me to move again. this time away from the partner I d just married. It was my dream gig. although my fantasies had somehow omitted the parts about regular 1 a.m. work nights and on-call weekends. Meanwhile. a new protest seemed to erupt every day ― not that my work schedule allowed me to attend ― because every day a new Black person. including one of my best friends earlier this year. was killed by the state. Every day. the grief and the work and the loss compounded.My coping efforts kept me from having a full breakdown. but eventually I couldn t focus. I couldn t sleep. My anxiety got so physically intense that I felt like I might throw up if I got stuck in a prolonged conversation with someone I didn t know. If I didn t write down every task. brain fog erased it from my memory.At the end of my rope. I finally set up a psychiatrist appointment. Even then. because I d learned to manage my most acute sadness. I was focused on feeling good enough to get work done. like the good capitalist this society encourages us all to be. I still didn t want to imagine myself with depression. so I convinced myself I might have ADHD. This avoidant misdiagnosis arose from a lack of clarity about how depression manifests. There are so many ways depression can show up: disinterest. having a hard time getting through things. anger and irritability. anxiety.  Mclaurin explains.  You can miss it very easily. especially because of stigma. Of course. the stigma against mental health treatment is prevalent in every community. but for Black people it can take certain insidious forms.  Where other people can be like. ‘I m scared I m going to lose my personality.  Black people are like. ‘I m scared that I will stop caring about my people or the struggles that we face.   Mclaurin says.In facing the monster I d made depression to be. I first had to face the fear Mclaurin alludes to: losing my connection to Black people s pain. On top of this. I had to face the fear of utilizing a system that has been complicit in our oppression. and the fear that I was the weakest link among parents and peers who never had access to treatment and still ostensibly survived. On the other hand. if I pursued treatment and it was successful. I d have to face the possibility of leaving behind the folks in my community who didn t have access to this resource. and the survivor s guilt that would accompany this. I have a lot of Black clients who are like. ‘I need resources. My material reality needs to be shifted.   Mclaurin says.  That s real. But we can t shift these systems overnight. And we especially can t shift these systems. period. if we don t take care of ourselves. Any good mental health expert will tell you that medication is not an all-encompassing solution ― but it can be an extremely helpful tool. And we should use every helpful tool we can. Mclaurin insists. especially since we are systematically denied so many. It turned out that my other coping tools complemented my meds rather than competing with them. I d thought that to seek further help was a sign of weakness. but therapy and spiritual work helped me understand that it s really a practical act of self-preservation.I used to think my parents and peers survived without help. before unpacking this myth with therapy and ancestor work I believed it even as I watched my mother die of a cancer that kills Black people with uteruses at more than twice the rate of other groups. even as I saw a burgeoning suicide epidemic end too many of my friends  lives. I was convinced that living in pain. which inherently drains us of the energy to battle. was actually a sign of putting up a good fight.By the time my psychiatrist confirmed what I secretly already knew. I understood the need to reject antidepressant stigma on a theoretical level. But I couldn t shake the feeling that accepting her prescription of Lexapro would mean I was somehow giving up on my own ability to heal. Will I have to keep increasing the dose?  I asked anxiously. explosions going off in my head.  Not generally.  she replied.  And if you ever feel like you don t need it anymore. we can talk about coming off. too.  Hearing her reframe medication as a journey. and not as a type of surrender. morphed this monster of depression into something a little less terrifying.And who knows? Perhaps my own ability to fight will never be quite enough. Sometimes. I still fear being so weak and broken that I need that magic pill. But I m beginning to understand that only someone intent on keeping me weak and broken would want me to feel so much shame about my  brokenness  that I don t fight for my peace. I don t want to be my own enemy. I don t want to be the person lobbing those judgment grenades. no matter how strong and put together I m  supposed  to be to survive. Those who set these ableist. anti-Black rules never cared about our well-being in the first place.Besides. I m now a few months into taking antidepressants. and I can confirm they aren t magical. They might take a while to work. and can have nasty side effects. Some might not work for everyone. and all of them are marketed by profit-driven pharmaceutical companies that have no real interest in our overall well-being. Any new medication should be approached with education and curiosity. And even amid my largely successful journey with antidepressants so far. I still get sad. I still need to work at community building and mindfulness and drinking less. And I still need for us to be free of the systems that have contributed to my pain. But because I ve begun to stop equating this journey with failure. I can now work at these things with a clearer head. more stable moods. and a stomach no longer constantly churning from anxiety. I can work at these things after a full night s rest. I can work at these things and still experience genuine joy and be present in my body. for what feels like the first time since my mother s cancer forced me to face a monster. And maybe now. I ll be better able to help someone else face their own.If you re going through it and looking for a little help navigating your journey. know that there are resources specifically for you.

Much like our underperformance in the ongoing plague still ravaging the world. the United States leads in infections for the latest global medical scare.The U.S. has reported 4.639 known monkeypox cases as of Wednesday. according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — surpassing Spain s 3.738 cases for the world s highest tally. Globally. over 20.600 cases have been confirmed in 77 nations. Of that figure. more than 20.300 were confirmed in countries that have not historically reported monkeypox infections.In response to the rising numbers. our government has issued a familiar call to the public. The international community must work together to protect individuals that have been impacted by monkeypox. and those most at risk of contracting the virus.  White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said during a press briefing Tuesday. We want to make sure that we — all Americans ― understand that we have taken. continue to take this virus seriously.  Jha added.  We re going to continue working on increasing access to testing. vaccines and treatments. and making sure that Americans understand what risks and challenges this virus faces and what the administration is doing to respond to it. Yet. much like the federal government s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. there is reason to question just how seriously the people in charge of protecting public health are taking the problem. based on choices that have only led to needless pain and suffering among vulnerable populations.Last Saturday. the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global health emergency. Although the Biden administration is said to be weighing a similar declaration. one thing is for certain: Unlike with COVID-19 in 2020. there is already a vast quantity of vaccines available to help contain the virus.A month ago. when the outbreak first reached New York City. there were reportedly nearly 300.000 doses of the ready-to-use Jynneos vaccine owned by the U.S. sitting in a facility in Denmark. They could have been shipped to the U.S. at the time. But. as noted by New York Times reporters Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Otterman. the government was slow to deploy the vaccine. originally developed and stockpiled for use against smallpox. and as a result. failed to contain the largest monkeypox outbreak in America. The U.S. government intentionally de-prioritized gay men s health in the midst of an out-of-control outbreak because of a potential bioterrorist threat that does not currently exist.  James Krellenstein. a Brooklyn-based gay health activist. explained to the Times.So. our government saw a real problem and opted for a wait-and-see approach in case a nonexistent one arises.If that weren t all embarrassing enough. bureaucracy is apparently delaying vaccine shipments: The Food and Drug Administration still has yet to inspect and certify a new facility outside Copenhagen where the company now fills the vaccine into vials.Against the backdrop of the government s sluggish response is the widening stigmatization of gay. bisexual and other men who have sex with men. who have accounted for the bulk of cases so far.Already. there is a misconception that the virus is a sexually transmitted infection. Monkeypox transmission typically occurs through close contact for an extended period of time ― which can include sex ― but it can also spread via articles of clothing. bedding or towels that have been in contact with an infectious patient.As Dr. Amy Arrington. medical director of the special isolation unit at Texas Children s Hospital. told ABC News:  You cannot get this virus from touching an elevator button. from walking past someone in the mall casually. It is spread by close contact ― contact with lesions. so touching infectious lesions or infectious scabs. Not enough people understand that we have to venture back to the days of letting disinfectant wipes be our BFFs until we get more vaccines rather than keeping away from men who are into other men.The longer America goes without a public health campaign centered on monkeypox. the likelier it is for misinformation to spread. The longer misinformation is allowed to shape the discourse around monkeypox. the greater worry we should have about the safety of gay and bisexual men. It is no secret that the LGBTQ community has been vilified by the Republican Party and conservative media.The last thing the community needs in the midst of a health crisis is a rehash of 1980s-style stigmatization combined with the 2020s climate of rising violence.Dr. Anthony Fauci. President Joe Biden s chief medical adviser. said on Tuesday that the administration should work to remove any homophobic stigma attached to contracting monkeypox.In an interview with NPR s  All Things Considered.  Fauci said the U.S. needs to  get rid of anything that even smacks a little bit of stigma.  Concentrate on what the reality is.  explained Fauci. who also serves as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  You fight the virus. You don t stigmatize the people who are infected with the virus. You reach out to the community. You make it very easy for them to have access to testing. to treatment. and to vaccines. as opposed to making it a situation where people are afraid to come forward for those types of things. But as the federal government awaits the arrival of millions of vaccine doses in the coming months. there remains a lack of access to antiviral treatments and testing. according to The Washington Post. We are essentially rationing health care.  Anthony Fortenberry. chief nursing officer at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. an LGBTQ provider in New York City. told the paper.  Those that are most connected and privileged are able to access those resources. I can speak from experience that there are not enough shots of the Jynneos vaccine to protect all sexually active gay and bisexual men.And like many reading this. I have mostly learned about the impact of monkeypox thanks to TikTok videos. local press. and newly infected people offering testimonials.To those of us who lived in New York City at the start of the pandemic. when many of our days and nights were scored by the sounds of ambulances that signaled sickness and death. the failure to act when people in the city are in pain is incredibly frustrating.For men who have sex with men and have been the predominant group of people experiencing monkeypox infections. the federal response ― lacking in testing. vaccinations and other treatments ― is especially maddening given long-standing health care disparities plaguing our community.But with infections now being found in county jails and in school-age children. I worry that come fall. monkeypox will affect all Americans ― and that once again. only the privileged will be able to grapple with the pain associated with it.As much as government officials profess to be working feverishly to stop the spread of monkeypox. their inaction thus far has given way to a predictable result: The virus is moving wildly across the country with no real plan to fight back.Our federal government should be better than this and is failing us once again. ,Health News
Mena SuvariThe GuardianSuvari. who is best known for her roles in the 1999 films  American Beauty  and  American Pie.  says her ex. a lighting engineer. coerced her into using uncomfortable sex toys and forced her to pick up other women for threesomes.The 43-year-old writes about the experience in her 2021 memoir.  The Great Peace.  From name-calling to needing medical treatment after repeated. rough anal sex. she said she was so desperate for his affection that she dealt with the abuse by doing drugs. I was not being loved. I was just a body. a receptacle for his desires.  she wrote in her memoir.While in the relationship. Suvari said. she endured countless acts of sexual abuse. such as being forced tobring in other women for threesomes ― even those she met while working.She told The Guardian that after the relationship ended. she ran into one of the women she had a threesome with and told her.  I want you to know that I never wanted to do any of those things. The woman was surprised and said the ex told her that Suvari  wanted to do that. Suvari called the moment an  eye-opener.  allowing her to see how she had been manipulated by him. The circumstances had been created for me. and I was just swallowed up by it.  she added.she was raped by a friend of her older brother s when she was in the sixth grade. Suvari also pointed out that she s not judging others who may enjoy threesomes or sex toys. I ve never wanted to speak negatively about things that can be very healthy for other people. I was not given the choice or the permission to do it. and that s what was so destructive for me.  she told The Guardian.Suvari added that the  messed up thing  about experiencing sexual abuse is that part of it is  like. satisfying. But then the other part is an absolute nightmare. so you re confused. you don t know what s right. All of that still weighs on me because I never got the opportunity to discover myself in that way.  She said the idea of dating someone in high school and then deciding to lose your virginity to that person  sounds so beautiful to me.  but  all of that was lost for me. works with disadvantaged youth at Vista Del Mar in Southern California.Need help?

international studyResearchers at the University of Calgary in Canada examined data collected from 36 emergency departments in eight countries. The families of 1.884 children who tested positive for COVID while in the emergency room were contacted 90 days later and asked about post-COVID conditions ― defined as  persistent. new. or returning symptoms or health problems  associated with the condition that brought them to the emergency department.Overall. 5.8% of children who had tested positive for COVID reported post-COVID conditions. Rates were higher in children who ended up being hospitalized for 48 hours or more. who reported four or more symptoms in their initial visit to the emergency department. or who were ages 14 and up.Approximately 9.8% of children who were hospitalized for 48 hours or more reported post-COVID conditions. while 4.6% of those who were discharged from the emergency room reported post-COVID issues. Researchers also found that children who were hospitalized and experienced  severe outcomes  within 14 days were more likely to report symptoms 90 days later than hospitalized children with less serious illness.adultsstatement Our finding that children who had multiple COVID-19 symptoms initially were at higher risk for long COVID is consistent with studies in adults.  said Dr. Todd Florin. co-principal investigator of the study. Unfortunately. there are no known therapies for long COVID in children and more research is needed in this area.  Florin said.  However. if symptoms are significant. treatment targeting the symptoms is most important. It s worth noting that all the children enrolled in the study had been brought to emergency departments. so they may have been more likely to exhibit serious symptoms. It s also possible that some children were brought to the emergency room for an unrelated issue and tested positive for COVID while they were there. Regardless. the study shows that children who were sicker. as indicated by their hospitalization or the number of symptoms they reported. were more likely to report post-COVID conditions 90 days later.Researchers followed a separate group of children who were seen in the ER but tested negative for COVID. and some of these children (5% of those hospitalized and 2.7% of those discharged from the ER) also reported symptoms such as fatigue. weakness and shortness of breath 90 days after they were seen in the emergency department.Data from the study shows that post-COVID conditions such as these were reported approximately twice as often among children who had tested positive for COVID. compared to children who d tested negative. Because of this study.  we may be able to predict which kids are at risk for long COVID.  Dr. Candice Jones. a board-certified pediatrician not affiliated with the study. told HuffPost.Jones also noted that the rate of post-COVID conditions in children that researchers found is much lower than the rate among adult patients.Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAmerican Academy of Pediatrics We know vaccination can prevent COVID infection. prevent severe illness. prevent hospitalization and death ― thus minimizing the child s risk for long COVID.  Jones said.,Health News
heat wavesrecord-setting temperaturesgo for regular walksBelow. pet experts break down what you need to know about letting your cats out in the heat.Mieshelle NagelschneiderCat Behavior ClinicAmerican Association of Feline PractitionersTry to let them out during cooler times of day. like early in the morning and in the evening. Give them plenty of fresh. clean water and use a bowl that isn t metal. as that can get overheated in the scorching temperatures. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals You ll also want to make sure your cat is able to get back inside easily in the event that they get too hot. Consider investing in a cooling mat where they can seek relief as well.  Outdoor cats may seek shelter in unlikely places in an attempt to stay cool. so carefully check for cats under cars before driving and in open sheds and garages before locking them up.  Valuska advised. NOLAs Finest Pet CareShe recommended having a properly fitted harness for your cat s walks so that you can keep them safe and supervised. Make sure their paws are protected as well. Sidewalks and pavement can be extremely hot and cause burns to the paw pads.  said Dr. Emily Cross. a veterinarian at Purina.  It is best to have animals in the grass versus on hot surfaces. You can touch the sidewalk or pavement with your hand or bare foot. If it feels hot to you. it is too hot for them as well. paw wax As pets are close to the ground. the hot asphalt can also contribute to their body heating up very quickly.  Ball said.  Pets with paw pad burns will limp. refuse to walk. and the top layer of skin will look like it s blistering and peeling. or may even be absent. Hot asphalt can burn the sensitive paw pads on our pets. Always check for redness between toes and cracks on your pet s paw pads.  Just like dogs. a cat s only means of cooling itself off is by panting and sweating through its paws.  Nagelschneider noted.  You never want to see your cat pant. even during a play time. You ve overexerted your cat if you see this. Indeed. panting is not typical behavior in cats. so if you observe this. you should immediately move them to an air-conditioned and shaded place and give them water. Contact your vet. especially if they show other signs of heat stroke. like vomiting. dizziness. lethargy. drooling or bright red gums. Look out for sweaty paw prints as well.  Have an action plan in place so you can act early if you see a problem.  Valuska said.  Get to know your cat s normal behaviors during milder temperatures so that you re better equipped to notice a change in behavior indicating they may not be coping well with heat. Cat behavior changes can be subtle. so close observation of your cat is key.  Young cats and kittens and older cats are especially susceptible to heat stroke.  Nagelschneider said.  Overweight cats and breeds with shorter faces like Persians are at higher risk for heat stroke. Certain breeds of cat are brachycephalic ― which means their skull bones are shorter. giving them that flat-faced appearance. These breeds. which include Persian. Himalayan. and Burmese cats. tend to have breathing issues and don t pant as effectively. so you ll want to pay extra-close attention to them in hot environments and keep them inside when possible. Like humans. pets can also get sunburned. especially on noses. ears and any exposed skin.  Ball said.  This should be considered for any pet. but especially hairless cats. Avoid putting sunscreen that was formulated for humans on your pets.  Check with your vet about recommendations for a cat-safe sunscreen for noses and ears. especially on cats with white fur.  Valuska advised. Ball also recommended antiparasitic products (like preventative sprays. drops. and oral medications) to ward off fleas. ticks and worms during the summer months.  Always be sure to read the labels before applying to your pet.  she said.  Cats don t have a thirst drive like humans and dogs do. so they may need extra encouragement to stay hydrated.  Valuska said.  Consider supplementing their diet with wet food or liquid complements and making their water more attractive by investing in a ‘cat fountain  and sanitizing their water bowl regularly. In higher temperatures. food might spoil more quickly and attract bugs. so be sure to change it more often. International Cat Care sInternational Society of Feline MedicineDowgray also recommended adding flavor to their water with the liquid left over from a can of tuna in spring water or from poaching a piece of chicken or fish. In hot weather. cats often won t eat during the day but will eat at night or in the early morning when it s cooler. so you might need to adjust your feeding times to suit your cat s preferences.  Dowgray added. Cat Behavior AllianceIf you have a shaved cat. refrain from taking them out in the sun. as their skin is fragile and susceptible to sunburn.  Fur protects skin from heat and sunburn. so consider a trim instead.  McGee advised.  Consult with your groomer about summer cuts. Regular grooming practices like brushing can also remove shedding hair and help your cat feel more cool and comfortable. For pet parents that have cats with beautiful long fur such as Maine coons and Norwegian forests. make sure to brush daily.  McGee added. ,Health News

SEATTLE (AP) — The Seattle City Council voted Tuesday to make the city a sanctuary for abortion providers and patients. meaning Seattle police will not cooperate in arrests or investigations related to abortion bans in other states.reportedWhile abortion remains legal across Washington state. the new legislation bars Seattle police from arresting people on warrants issued in other jurisdictions or helping in investigations related to seeking or performing abortions. It follows the model of Seattle s Initiative 75. which similarly stopped the Seattle Police Department from pursuing charges based on cannabis. which remains federally illegal. Laws violating basic bodily autonomy and criminalizing reproductive health care are fundamentally unjust and we should not allow Seattle to be complicit.  Sawant said Tuesday. touting support from 5.500 community members who signed a petition backing the legislation.joined with Oregon and California to refuse nonfugitive extraditionAll three states anticipate an influx of people seeking abortions in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court s June 24 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. the 1973 decision that had provided a constitutional right to abortion. especially as neighboring states such as Idaho move to outlaw or mostly restrict the procedure.Sawant said she hopes Seattle is setting the example of how to protect those denied reproductive health care elsewhere. noting that council members in Minneapolis and Chicago had reached out. indicating their intent to pass similar policies. If bringing it here can help it spread to other cities and states. the impact could be truly profound.  Sawant said before the vote.The bill was approved by all six council members at Tuesday s meeting. while three were absent.Mayor Bruce Harrell said in June that Seattle police would not pursue related arrests  that are inconsistent with Washington laws and most important our values.  but Sawant s is the first concrete protection established in the city since the U.S. Supreme Court decision.The council in August will consider two bills designed to protect those seeking abortion care from discrimination and penalize people who interfere with health care including abortions and gender-affirming care. The bills were introduced last week by Councilmembers Lisa Herbold and Tammy Morales. I m really looking forward to working to find ways to expand abortion access and protect what can only be called medical refugees. people who are coming here and cannot receive basic health care in their home states.  Herbold said Tuesday.,Health News
Two new studies provide more evidence that the coronavirus pandemic originated in a Wuhan. China market where live animals were sold – further bolstering the theory that the virus emerged in the wild rather than escaping from a Chinese lab.The research. published online Tuesday by the journal Science. shows that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was likely the early epicenter of the scourge that has now killed nearly 6.4 million people around the world. Scientists conclude that the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2. likely spilled from animals into people two separate times. All this evidence tells us the same thing: It points right to this particular market in the middle of Wuhan.  said Kristian Andersen a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and coauthor of one of the studies.  I was quite convinced of the lab leak myself until we dove into this very carefully and looked at it much closer. studyThey asked.  Of all the locations that the early cases could have lived. where did they live? And it turned out when we were able to look at this. there was this extraordinary pattern where the highest density of cases was both extremely near to and very centered on this market.  Worobey said at a press briefing.  Crucially. this applies both to all cases in December and also to cases with no known link to the market … And this is an indication that the virus started spreading in people who worked at the market but then started to spread into the local community. Andersen said they found case clusters inside the market. too.  and that clustering is very. very specifically in the parts of the market  where they now know people were selling wildlife. such as raccoon dogs. that are susceptible to infection with the coronavirus.other study Now I realize it sounds like I just said that a once-in-a-generation event happened twice in short succession.  Wertheim said. But certain conditions were in place — such as people and animals in close proximity and a virus that can spread from animals to people and from person to person. So  barriers to spillover have been lowered such that multiple introductions. we believe. should actually be expected.  he said.jumped from bats to humansBut in June Have we disproven the lab leak theory? No. we have not.  Andersen said.  But I think what s really important here is there are possible scenarios and there are plausible scenarios and it s really important to understand that possible does not mean equally likely. The pandemic s origins remain controversial. Some scientists believe a lab leak is more likely and others remain open to both possibilities. But Matthew Aliota. a researcher in the college of veterinary medicine at the University of Minnesota. said in his mind the pair of studies  kind of puts to rest. hopefully. the lab leak hypothesis.  Both of these two studies really provide compelling evidence for the natural origin hypothesis.  said Aliota. who wasn t involved in either study. Since sampling an animal that was at the market is impossible.  this is maybe as close to a smoking gun as you could get. ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Walking is a powerful tool for both our physical and mental health ― perhaps even more powerful than we think.Harvard Healthhas been used oftenunderscore the importance of going for a walkIn other words. walking has serious health benefits. along with being a free workout that doesn t require any equipment or much planning.If that information alone doesn t convince you to hit the pavement. here are a few other reasons to embrace walking and some advice on how to incorporate more of it into your day.Dr. Tamanna SinghAnd. while walking isn t associated with the same kind of energy exertion as spin classes or interval runs. it s just as valuable and can help people of all ages and health backgrounds better their health outcomes. Anyone can benefit from walking.  Singh said. People who have minimal or no cardiovascular risk can prevent disease. while those who deal with things like high blood pressure. high cholesterol. diabetes or obesity can use walking to reach their health goals and prevent future strokes or heart attacks. she added.In fact. walking is so good for so many different things. the Harvard Health report stated that  the next time you have a medical check-up. don t be surprised if your doctor hands you a prescription to walk. Working from your living room. your kitchen or your office may have its perks (no commuting!) but there are also some disadvantages. Many of us are sitting more than ever because of the current work-from-home lifestyle. and sitting all day can affect our bodies over time.previously told HuffPostSingh noted that walking in any capacity keeps you from prolonged sitting. which can only be a health benefit in the long run.Singh said that going for a walk with friends is a great way to create accountability for both you and your walking buddies. Think about it: You re more likely to lace up your sneakers if your friend is heading over to meet you for a walk you agreed to earlier in the week. You ll each hold each other accountable to developing a walking habit and sticking to it.  Singh said. And you don t have to task your friend group with high-stress. quick-paced walks. As long as you get out there. you re benefiting your body. Plus. if you re someone who likes to walk and talk. you ll get some enjoyable conversation and laughter out of a walk with a friend. Singh noted. If you are more of a solo exerciser. Singh suggested that you save a good podcast. audiobook or soundtrack for your walks to make them more enjoyable. Try telling yourself that you can only listen to these things during your walks. It ll get you excited to go on a walk. and [you ll] get the ‘reward  of listening to your favorite thing.  Singh said.Between work. errands. family obligations and household chores. life is busy. Taking time for yourself may not be feasible right now and that s OK. If you can t fit in the recommended 21 minutes of walking a day. start small.  Even a quick one-minute jaunt pays off.  according to the report by Harvard Health. The report noted that a 2014 study from the University of Utah found that  for every minute of brisk walking that women did throughout the day. they lowered their risk of obesity by 5%. So start small. Task yourself with a minute-long walk down your driveway this afternoon. or take that 10-minute work check-in call as you walk around your block. No amount of time is too short.Once you feel ready. you can start to incorporate different walking distances and intensities. like speed changes and hills. Singh said. Both of these things. plus  maintaining a consistent habit will likely yield the biggest bang for its buck.  she explained.,Health News

The electric bill Chantel Watkins pays every month costs more than a week of groceries for her family of four.Yet at any given moment. the power might flicker off. setting in motion a series of expensive and potentially deadly events. Depending on how long it takes for electricity to be restored. the food might spoil in the fridge. If there s heavy rain. like last year. the basement of her townhouse on Detroit s East Side might flood with the electric sump pump disabled. If her partner or 11-year-old stepson have an asthma attack. especially if the power goes out during a lung-constricting heat wave. she might need to call an ambulance. since the breathing machines they use need power and don t have batteries. Outages are so routine in the Detroit suburb where Watkins  parents live ― up to six times a year ― that the retirees depleted their savings buying a generator to shore up her father s breathing machines. Detroit s long-neglected power grid failed her most recently on a hot afternoon in May. At home with her infant son. Watkins. 31. a nonprofit worker. lost electricity for six hours. She had to frantically call her partner and her stepson to tell them to stay at work and school. lest the 90-degree air in the house trigger an attack.  It was not even summer yet. but I told them not to come home because it was too hot. But I also have a 1-year-old. and he cannot be in a hot house.  Watkins said.  Not having power.  she added with a huff.  It sucks. Millions of people across the United States may soon join Watkins in teetering on the edge between modernity and darkness. The patchwork of power grids that kept the country s lights on for much of the last century is dangerously strained. Extreme weather and growing electricity use are demanding more of the grid at just the moment when the supply of 24/7 power is shrinking. With heat waves already roasting broad swaths of the nation. this summer s brutal forecasts mean rolling blackouts are more likely than at any other point in living memory ― and the risk only gets worse by the year. In Texas this month. where ideologically guided deregulation caused rolling blackouts last year that left hundreds dead. the grid operator urged customers to cut back on power use as demand surged. In New York City. where a nuclear plant that once provided the bulk of the five boroughs  zero-carbon power shut down last year. the local power utility sent text messages last week urging ratepayers to cut back amid a heat wave.In California. rolling blackouts have become a feature of wildfire season as the utilities prefer shutting down power lines to the legal liability of potentially having some equipment spark a blaze.Of the country s nine grid regions. none is more vulnerable this year than the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). It covers Watkins and the 42 million other people living in 15 states along the Mississippi River. from Louisiana to Michigan and beyond. into the Canadian province of Manitoba.  We re the greatest country in the world.  said Tony Anderson. the general manager of the Cherryland Electric Cooperative in Grawn. Michigan.  And now we re talking about shutting people off because we don t have the generation to serve them.  To understand why the MISO (pronounced MY-so) is in such peril. one could look to southwest Michigan. where the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station closed in May despite a last-ditch scramble by state and federal leaders to save the plant. which was deemed safe to produce enough zero-carbon power for 800.000 homes. The closure came just two days after the North American Electric Reliability Corp.. the federally backed nonprofit responsible for developing standards for keeping the lights on across the continent. released its annual report listing the MISO as the system most at risk of blackouts this summer. Across the Upper Midwest. coal and nuclear plants have come offline faster than new generators capable of matching demand are coming online. and routine infrastructure repairs have temporarily shrunk supply even more. The seeds of chaos were sown in the 1990s. when states began  restructuring  electricity markets to force more competition among power plant operators. Undergirding this change was the belief that pitting plants against each other in hourly battles for market share would take profit away from the power plants and hand it back to the consumer in the form of lower prices on energy bills. As a result. electricity rates went from reflecting what monopoly utilities and the elected commissioners that regulated them said was needed to cover long-term costs to the lowest price in a daily bidding war. The market shift not only failed to deliver steadily cheap electricity. it allowed short-term thinking to dominate the system. a National Bureau of Economic Research study concluded in 2015. That year marked something of a turning point for the grid. In 2015. as new federal regulations limiting toxic mercury emissions from coal stations were poised to come into effect. plant owners were forced to decide between investing in costly equipment upgrades or shut down. Many. already nearing the end of a coal plant s ordinary lifespan. chose to close. Construction of new coal plants is unlikely. Though coal has stubbornly defied forecasts of its demise. the extraordinary toll its pollution takes on the climate in the long term and on surrounding communities in the short term raises doubts over whether a new plant would last long enough to earn back the initial investment. Financial pressures mounted on coal plants over the past decade as the U.S. boom in hydraulic fracturing. the drilling technique known as fracking. made natural gas cheap. The plummeting price of wind turbines. photovoltaic panels and batteries squeezed coal even tighter. Another wave of closures even bigger than 2015 is set to crash in 2028. when a record number of coal plants will cease operation. Nuclear plants can most easily make use of the grid infrastructure built around coal stations. Butnuclear power. which can deliver a bounty of coal-quality electricity without the climate-changing emissions. faces a similar problem. The nation s aging fleet of roughly 90 reactors has struggled to compete against gas and renewables in markets that aren t typically designed to factor in nuclear plants  unique dependability or the subsidies and loans making renewables and gas cheap. As with coal plants. environmentalists have fiercely protested to close nuclear stations over concerns about Chernobyl-style accidents and the lack of permanent disposal for radioactive waste that remains dangerous for millenniums. In many places. shutdowns of coal and nuclear plants have been lauded as steps toward cleaner futures. While that may be true of coal. new. cleaner forms of generation have not kept pace with closures. and the grid s infrastructure has not undergone the costly overhauls needed to accommodate more renewables. If that mismatch of goals results in blackouts. environmentalists  victories against coal plants could prove Pyrrhic. Eliminating the 40% of U.S. climate-changing emissions that come from things like fueling automobiles and heating buildings will. in most cases. require swapping internal-combustion-engine cars for electric vehicles and gas furnaces for electric heat pumps. Even with more efficient appliances and conservation measures. that shift could drive up demand for electricity by 38% by 2050. according to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory study. And that estimate isn t factoring in the myriad other potential new sources of intense energy demand in a hotter world. such as desalination plants to turn saltwater to freshwater or direct air capture machines to suck CO₂ from the atmosphere ― to say nothing of phenomena such as Bitcoin mining.  Demand is going up and supply is going down. That s the problem.  said Jim Matheson. chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. a trade group representing nonprofit co-ops in 47 states.  We can t have some aspirational policy where if we remove these plants. somehow the market will take care of this in an orderly fashion. That s not going to happen. Before the mercury regulations kicked in for coal plants. Eric Baker. chief executive of Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative. said he had never seen what is known as a  max gen  event ― a moment when demand is so close to eclipsing supply on the grid that operators halt all maintenance and planned outages to generate maximum volumes of power.  Prior to 2016. there were none. Since 2016. we ve had 40. and last year we had a record.  said Baker. whose co-op distributes power around rural Michigan.  That s what I see as a canary in the coal mine that says the grid is being taxed.  It s partly a transmission problem. High-voltage power lines are critical for moving renewable electricity from where it can be plentifully generated to where it s needed. connecting vast solar parks in the desert or wind farms in rural fields to energy-thirsty cities and towns. But power lines are notoriously hard to build in a country where property laws tilt in favor of not-in-my-backyard landowners and where corporations bent on slowing the transition to cleaner energy wield tremendous political influence.It salso an issue of what kinds of generators are being built and closed. Coal and nuclear plants run continuously as long as there s enough fuel to heat the water that spins the turbines that produce electricity. Coal-fired units typically keep about a month s supply on site. Nuclear reactors usually need access to cold water as coolant. which can be a restriction on hot days. but can go two years without being refueled. Along with hydroelectric plants. which are limited only by droughts and regulations dictating water levels in dams. those stations are considered sources of  baseload power.  an industry term for the amount of electricity needed to meet constant. year-round demand.Renewables such as wind and solar. by contrast. depend on the weather being gusty and sunny. and they require very large arrays of turbines and panels to produce equivalent volumes of electricity to a coal or nuclear plant. This poses a challenge for system operators. whose job is to ensure electricity supplies match the grid s Goldilocks need for power levels that are just right. If a field of turbines on the Great Plains is spinning hard one blustery afternoon but the operator doesn t have enough spare room on its transmission lines to convey that electricity to a distant city s roaring air conditioners. then it s necessary to keep that wind farm off the grid during that time. It s a different story if that turbine funnels into a battery that the grid operators can tap into on demand. But batteries on that scale remain costly and scarce. particularly as growing demand for electric vehicles saps the already-limited supply of minerals and metals needed to make them. As a result. a record 1.44 terawatts of proposed wind. solar and battery generation ― enough to power 80% of the country s electricity needs by 2030 ― is on hold. waiting for the greenlight from grid operators so construction can begin. Most will likely never be built. but it shows a tremendous push. Compared to a decade ago. that s a roughly 230% increase. an unprecedented clean-energy feast that the grid can t stomach. But what if the air is still on a scorching day. as is often ― and perhaps increasingly. as global warming weakens winds in the central U.S. ― the case? Until there are enough powerful batteries to do the trick. operators need to be able to fire up generators to avoid blackouts as air conditioners hum away. That s where natural gas plants come in. Over the past decade. cheap loans from Wall Street flooded into fracking companies  coffers. rendering gas cheap and transforming the U.S. into one of the world s top exporters of oil and liquefied natural gas. Gas-fired plants are relatively inexpensive and simple to build. and they offer clear advantages. On a day when electricity demand is peaking. it s no easy task to rev up an idle coal generator or a nuclear reactor. A gas turbine. however. can reach full capacity in minutes ― if there s fuel to burn. That s a big if. Unlike with coal or nuclear fuel. natural gas is pumped into a power plant and used instantly. not stored on site just in case. If pipelines freeze or a compressor station stops working or increased demand for heating fuel shrinks the supply of natural gas for power. then gas plants can t produce electricity. New pipelines. like transmission lines. are difficult to build and face stiff opposition. There s good reason for climate activists to protest pipelines. While natural gas produces less carbon and fewer toxic air pollutants than coal. its main component. methane. traps 80 times as much heat as carbon during the first 20 years it s circulating in the atmosphere. And gas infrastructure frequently leaks. But for coal-fired generation to keep shrinking and renewables to keep growing. gas will remain the go-to source of backup generation. at least until other options become cheap and abundant.Blackouts are no minor inconvenience. Without electricity. traffic lights stop working. Lifesaving medical equipment becomes useless. Crime increases. including potentially violent episodes.When the Texas grid buckled amid February 2021 s Winter Storm Uri. hundreds ― far more than initially counted ― died in freezing weather. in darkness and often of chronic diseases that went untreated by overwhelmed emergency services. Few of the 4.645 people killed in Hurricane María. which decimated Puerto Rico s ailing power grid in 2017. died during the storm itself. Instead. most perished in the resulting 11-month blackout. the second-largest electrical outage in world history. when desperate citizens of the most powerful country on Earth lost access to medicine or were forced to drink contaminated water. Losing air conditioning during a heat wave can be an especially brutal way to die. From what scientists understand. high temperatures quickly cause brain swelling and organ failure. particularly in people who already suffer from illnesses that weaken their bodies  defenses. But  there s still a lot we don t know about heatstroke and who s most susceptible to it… because we can t ethically study it in humans in the laboratory.  W. Lawrence Kenney. an expert in human thermoregulation at Penn State University. previously told HuffPost.Demands on the grid only grow as climate regulations nudge more homeowners to switch to appliances and vehicles that use electricity instead of fossil fuels ― making the ability to stay safe in freezing temperatures or drive a car to warmth contingent upon a reliable power service. That could make the reliability of the grid in wintertime an even bigger concern. as some regions where demand peaks in summer predict reaching new cold-weather heights in the coming decades. In a separate report examining reliability issues throughout 2021. the North American Electric Reliability Corp. ― the organization. better known as NERC. that issues the annual grid reliability reports ― warned this month that the interdependence of the electrical and natural gas system was becoming a real threat. since the steady flow of gas depends on electricity. and vice versa. The report also recorded the first increase in the number of  unknown  or  unexplainable  errors that caused electrical disruptions across the country. up to 129 from 88 in 2020. But the sum of extreme weather disasters. from the heat dome that settled over the Pacific Northwest last summer to the Category 4 hurricane that walloped the East Coast months later. astounded even the NERC forecasters. NERC s most recent planning assessments have warned of the potential for the loss of large amounts of generating resources due to severe weather.  the most recent report said.  In what can only be described as extraordinary. 2021 saw the manifestation of each of these risks. Canned political narratives are becoming as common a feature of blackouts as tins of nonperishable foodstuffs. When California faced blackouts in recent years. critics on the right blamed renewables while those on the left highlighted the disruption as yet another sign of the need to get off fossil fuels even faster. When the Texas grid crumbled last year. the same talking points circulated. The truth. experts say. is more complicated. There were two issues at play in California. After one of its transformers sparked the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state s history in 2019. Pacific Gas & Electric faced nearly $2 billion in fines over the blaze. Though the utility giant ultimately reached a deal to pay just $55 million. the company started switching off its power lines when the risk of fire was high ― a strategy a federal judge upheld. In August 2020. however. millions lost power in the Golden State s first rolling blackouts in two decades because the grid operator had failed to correctly forecast demand during a heat wave and thus did not line up enough supply. according to a 121-page report that the state s three energy planning organizations published last year. When freak Arctic temperatures settled over Texas in February 2021. gas pipelines froze. nuclear reactors stopped working and homes that were not designed to stay warm demanded far more power than the state s uniquely deregulated electricity market could deliver. California avoided a worse disaster by importing electricity via transmission lines to neighboring states. But those transmission lines are limited. and officials in Sacramento are adding pressure as the state charges ahead with plans to shutter its last nuclear power station. which. unlike some reactors in the Midwest. functions well even in high heat because it uses ocean water for cooling. Texas could have benefited from connections to other grids. But the extreme deregulation that gave the Lone Star State cheap electricity rates in exchange for a brittle grid could have also spread blackouts even farther. to other states. But the problem in both states was that the existing playbook for forecasting electricity demand and delivering adequate supplies no longer works in an era when weather is becoming more extreme and less predictable. And under the market system that governs most grids. there is little incentive to build the kinds of generation that work all the time. For one full day in May. California generated virtually all of its electricity from renewables for the first time. In Texas. meanwhile. renewables were  bailing out  the beleaguered grid last week as record heat sent demand for electricity soaring. Since solar and wind require a fast-acting fuel like natural gas for backup generation on days the weather reduces sunshine or wind. markets with a larger percentage of renewables tend to have higher prices. That s because the grid is both paying for electricity from the generators themselves and for gas or hydro plants to wait on standby in case demand spikes.In California. that  works great for them because they have an economy that doesn t rely on a lot of energy.  said Jim Robb. NERC s president and chief executive. But. compared to California or Texas. manufacturing makes up nearly twice as large a share of Michigan s economy. National Association of Manufacturers data show. Michigan paid an average of about 12 cents per kilowatt of electricity in 2020. according to the most recently available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Missouri and Illinois. that price was less than 10 cents. California power. by contrast. cost 18 cents.  If you impose those rates on the Midwest or the South. where we still have a lot of metal-bending industry. it d be devastating to the economy.  Robb said. Without adequate transmission capacity to move huge volumes of renewable electricity around the grid. replacing nuclear or coal plants with solar and wind generation affects costs and supply the way swapping tractor-trailer shipments for whatever fits in the trunk of a passenger car might increase retail store prices. said Meredith Angwin. a grid reliability expert who has long argued that losing nuclear and coal plants would raise the risk of blackouts. If you have a semi going down the road. that is a really inexpensive way to move a lot of goods. but on the other hand. it s not very flexible.  Angwin said.  So when people say we don t want semis because they re not flexible. then what do you want? All goods to move by flexible sports cars? That s going to be expensive.  In theory. once more homes are equipped with solar panels and batteries. or have a battery in the form of an electric vehicle parked in the garage. grid operators could use remote technology to tap those resources. making them less reliant on big power plants. But that would require near-constant real-time monitoring of individual households  electricity use. stoking concerns over privacy and cyberattacks. That tension is particularly acute in the Midwest. where several states have enacted rules or laws limiting the data that so-called  smart meters  can collect.  Real-time monitoring of electricity would do essentially nothing to change behavior in rich households because electricity is a small cost compared to other life essentials.  said Mark Nelson. a Chicago-based engineer and energy consultant who advocates for more nuclear power.  But you can t always adjust. and the people who have to adjust are the people who suffer the most from adjusting.  Meanwhile. there are climate-friendly sources of backup generation in the works. Battery deployments in the U.S. grew by nearly 360% last year. according to a Business Council for Sustainable Energy report. But battery prices. once in precipitous decline. are leveling out and may even rise as supplies of materials. such as lithium. cobalt and copper. fail to keep pace with demand. Hydrogen. which burns like fossil fuels but produces water rather than CO₂ as a byproduct. could offer an attractive alternative. But nearly all the hydrogen on the market today is made with coal or natural gas. while just a tiny sliver is produced with electrolysers powered by solar or wind power ― the only type of H2 that does not generate greenhouse gas pollution. Another option on the horizon is the small modular reactor (SMR). a miniaturized type of nuclear reactor that proponents say can more easily rev up or down to provide power when demand peaks. But even optimistic estimates suggest the technology won t hit the market until the 2030s. and that assumes there are no accidents or regulatory hurdles that turn public opinion against small reactors.  In a world where you have a lot of wind and solar. which is going to be the vast majority of capacity additions we see in this country. maybe for the foreseeable future. having flexibility in the rest of the fleet is really. really important.  Robb said.  Until we have batteries. hydrogen. or SMRs. gas is the fuel that can provide that service.  The MISO declined an interview request. but a spokesperson directed HuffPost to an emergency declaration in June that it said was aimed at  keeping the power flowing  by providing  operators access to resources that are unavailable under normal grid conditions.  There s a chance there won t be any major blackouts this summer.  The situation is not as dire as what you get from the NERC report.  said Rob Gramlich. president of the energy consultancy Grid Strategies LLC. Rather. he accused those who are  nervous about the new world  of overemphasizing the report s findings in an attempt to  slow down everything  with the energy transition.  I sort of think it s like watching your teenagers grow up.  he said.  The first time they wear something to school that makes you cringe. you want to go back and for them to be an 11-year-old again. But you can t do that. You have to adjust to the new reality.  Like California. the MISO can tap neighboring grids. including the PJM Interconnection. The PJM ― which stands for Pennsylvania. New Jersey. Maryland ― is the oldest grid system in the U.S. and has generally resisted calls to shut down functioning coal and nuclear plants. The PJM readies up to 17% more generation than its forecasts show will be needed to provide ample backup on high-demand days. said Brandon Collins. a partner at the Philadelphia-based environmental and energy law firm Ballard Spahr. That means the PJM s  capacity markets.  the bidding pools that pay power plants to stay open and available. make maintaining a coal-fired unit or a reactor more financially viable. Still. Matheson from the NERC said the risk of blackouts grows worse by the year. This is something. not just in the summer of 2022. but 2023. 2024. 2025 and 2026. when more plants are scheduled to come offline.  the former Democratic congressman from Utah said. This is a very haphazard way to go about some type of transition here.  he added.  When you look at the 10.000-foot level. it s a very uncoordinated process if you want to maintain the reliability of the grid.  To avoid that. state and federal regulators could provide more direct aid to generating stations deemed vital to grid reliability. The Trump administration attempted to boost coal units this way but failed to enact specific policies to do so beyond diverting COVID-19 funding for small businesses to coal plant operators. The Biden administration secured $6 billion in funding for financially distressed nuclear reactors in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. though the program is just beginning to take shape. Illinois and New York included similar subsidies to shore up nuclear plants in their state-level decarbonization laws. Another option might be to relax pollution and climate regulations to give plant operators an incentive to invest in maintaining coal stations that might otherwise close. The Biden White House is also pushing forward with new regulations at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to make building transmission lines easier. Similar regulatory changes. like relaxing environmental impact assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act. could make it faster and easier to build more renewables with batteries. There s little appetite for new coal-fired generation. which would torpedo the U.S. s already-tenuous climate goals. New. more favorable regulations and federal support could make building new nuclear reactors easier. according to a report by the Breakthrough Institute. a pro-nuclear think tank in California. While government support did not save the first new U.S. reactors in a generation ― two units at Georgia s Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant ― from massive delays and cost overruns. nuclear advocates blamed bad engineering and project management. Future nuclear projects. they argue. could avoid those problems in part through having workers with actual experience building new fission reactors. States could also roll back the markets that sprang from the 1990s-era restructuring. Re-regulating electricity in that way could incentivize utilities to reintegrate operations and build more costly plants. like nuclear reactors. if those long-term investments come with the guarantee that future electricity prices will reflect actual costs. The U.S. could also bring parts of the electrical sector under direct government control. Such a policy has deep roots in the country. Since the 1930s. the government has played a major role in the utility sector through the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority. which was set up under the New Deal to bring electricity to the poor. rural Southeast that the market wasn t serving. It may sound old-fashioned ― or like easy fodder for red baiters ― but government takeover remains a popular tool in conservative. avowedly capitalist democracies. In April. the United Kingdom announced plans to nationalize part of its electrical grid in hopes of maintaining reliability as the country s right-wing government seeks to avoid potholes on the road to decarbonization. Earlier this month. France proposed bringing EDF. the country s largest electrical utility. back under the center-right government s complete ownership in a bid to alleviate its financial pressures and focus its efforts on building more nuclear reactors. Matheson called nationalization  a bridge too far.  Robb demurred. but. referring to the Eisenhower-era federal highway buildout. said that  it seems like we almost need that kind of thinking.  Though the 2020 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for bringing the country s power grid under public ownership. there is no active push for nationalization in the U.S. beyond some left-wing nonprofit proposals and state-level legislation to allow New York state authorities to build and own more clean electric generation. In the meantime. those with enough money are trying to shore up electricity for themselves. Over the past five years. Huck Krieger. a construction contractor in Michigan. said the number of clients hiring him to install solar panels. batteries and wiring for electric vehicles has soared. But most have been wealthy enough to not even bother negotiating prices with him. he said. That. he noted. doesn t bode well for the vast majority of people who can t afford to generate their own power.  If you don t have a way to cool down. it becomes a real threat.  said Krieger. 33. whose company is called Island View Improvement.  Once the grid goes down. people start to die.  Watkins. whose father struggles with severe breathing problems from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. said regular power outages in his Detroit suburb have stressed her family emotionally and financially.  My parents. they used a lot of retirement money to invest in a very expensive generator because my father is on oxygen.  Watkins said.  We know a lot of times when it comes to choosing who gets less. it s usually the people who have less to start with. Not only can we barely afford the power we do have. we are now facing our power in jeopardy.  ,Health News

Both opponents and supporters of abortion rights gathered to protest at the Indiana statehouse on Monday as legislators assembled for a special session on banning the procedure. Republicansabortionoverturned Roe v. Wadeso loudshakingThe demonstrations took over all three floors of the rotunda. with competing chants of  My body. my choice  and  Not your body. not your choice  booming throughout the building. reporters said. Nearly 300 people are signed up to deliver public comment.that such  life-saving  exceptions are poorly definedWhen pressed by Democrats on Monday as to why the bill doesn t include a clearer exception for abortion based on the pregnant person s physical health. Glick said the bill s sponsors are planning to  tighten up  that language.Glick added that as lawmakers propose amendments to the bill throughout the special session. her party will likely add language limiting the window of time when victims of rape and incest may seek an abortion. One of the first speakers during the public comment period was Dr. Mary Ott. a pediatrician testifying against the bill on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics  Indiana chapter. She argued that lowering abortion rates in Indiana should be done through better sex education and access to contraceptives. not by banning a procedure that should be a private decision. Dr. Mary Abernathy from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists followed shortly after. warning lawmakers that the law would disproportionately affect low-income women of color while more affluent white women could afford to travel out of state for abortions. Some of the commenters in support of ending abortion access said they were unhappy with the bill s rape and incest exceptions.Indiana Republicans. who hold a 71-29 majority in the House and a 39-11 majority in the Senate. have until Aug. 14 to pass the bill. but party leaders have expressed confidence they can wrap up ahead of the deadline with a week to spare. Vice President Kamala Harris met with nearly all of the Indiana Senate Democrats on Monday ahead of the special session to express her support for them as they begin a long-shot effort to block the legislation.  I would also say that on this issue. one does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision for her.  she said at a roundtable meeting.  An individual should be able to choose based on their personal beliefs and the dictates of their faith. But the government should not be telling an individual what to do. especially as it relates to one of the most intimate and personal decisions a woman could make. Perhaps. Harris added.  some people need to actually learn how a woman s body works. There has been an intense spotlight on abortion in Indiana throughout July after Republicans targeted a doctor in the state for providing an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim. The child traveled from Ohio. where the procedure has already been banned. for care. pursue chargesHe accused her of not following the proper protocol and called her an  abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failing to report  the procedure to the state. which Indiana doctors are required to do within three days when performing abortions on a patient under 16.But media investigations quickly confirmed that Bernard had reported the abortion and had no history of misconduct regarding the law. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost also attacked Bernard on Fox News. baselessly claiming there was  not a whisper anywhere  of a 10-year-old being raped in Ohio. Within a matter of days. multiple media reports confirmed that a 27-year-old man was arrested and charged after he confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.suing,Health News
As we begin to unpack the horrifying ramifications of the Supreme Court s decision in Dobbs. little discussion is given to what happens after birth. Those celebrating the decision for  protecting life  ignore the millions of women who lose their life from the physical and mental complications that follow a pregnancy. I know because I almost lost my life to postpartum depression.My husband and I were surprised. but excited. when I became pregnant within the first month of trying. After giving birth to my beautiful son in March of 2016. I returned to work three short months later. I began experiencing what I now know was postpartum depression ― though I didn t realize it at the time. I felt like I was stuck in a tunnel. where life passed me by. and I was on autopilot fighting to make it through the next minute. During my long commute to work. I d figure out how I would theatrically make it through the day. planning the words. emotions and the faces I d use to make everyone believe that I was okay. Sometimes my thoughts drifted to images of what would happen if I was in a deadly car crash.Suicidal ideation is a strange thing to explain. In the middle of doing a perfectly normal activity. my brain would drift into  what ifs?  No one knew what laid behind my eyes as my brain created a detailed image of everything that would happen if I died. I began to think it would make everyone s life easier. and everything would be fine without me.Looking back. I realize that my postpartum depression was triggered and exacerbated by the financial stress that came with having a baby in America. I grew up in an unstable household surrounded by emotionally unstable adults and experienced periods of homelessness as a child. I was determined to give my child a better life. In the midst of my suicidal ideation. the stress of becoming a financial burden scared me out of indulging the thoughts. But it also scared me out of seeking help. for fear I d be a financial burden on my family.My life changed overnight. but I never got the time to adjust to motherhood. I worked for a small business and was only able to take 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave after giving birth to my son. In order to pay bills. my husband and I took out a home equity line of credit. No mother wants to leave their baby with a stranger to return to work. but I had this huge loan looming over my head and feared losing my career.America is the only developed country in the world that doesn t guarantee at least some form of paid parental leave. In its absence. parents. typically mothers. are expected to make a decision: Give up your career to care for your baby or return to work and find a way to pay for the exorbitant and ever-increasing costs of child care.Lack of paid parental leave leads to physical and mental health problems for both parents and their babies. And in a country with the highest healthcare costs. many parents are forced to ignore their own health concerns. This contributes to America s status of having the highest and only increasing maternal mortality rate of any developed country. Forcing people into parenthood only serves to worsen the physical and financial wellbeing of all Americans.People like to place blame on poor planning or irresponsibility of families experiencing economic hardship. but nothing about having a baby in America is guaranteed. Our childcare plans fell through in my third trimester. when the family we trusted to be our child care provider moved out of state. When my son was born. he had medical complications that brought unexpected medical bills. After losing three months of income. taking out a loan on our house. paying these enormous medical bills and paying for unexpected child care expenses. the financial stress compounded the  mom-guilt.  Women often feel pressure to have a thriving career and be a present wife and mother. But. when you pour everything you have into work and family. there s rarely anything left to keep you going. The final straw was feeling like I  failed  at breastfeeding. Through my postpartum stress and depression. I became fixated on  succeeding  at breastfeeding. But my son was born with a lip tie and tongue tie that made breastfeeding extremely difficult.One night. while my son wailed out of hunger because I couldn t feed or pump. I found myself on the floor. blinking through tears and staring at packages of formula. unable to bring myself to accept defeat in my internal battle to be the  perfect mom.  As I began to succumb to these horrible feelings. I found myself alone in the kitchen with a knife in my hand. I thought it would be easier to die. I was sure my husband could do everything better than me ― better without me. Luckily. my husband walked into the kitchen and found me holding the knife. After confiding in my husband. I started digging myself out of the pits of postpartum depression. He convinced me to seek out mental health resources and coached me out of my fear of the financial burden that taking care of myself might bring. In therapy. I found strength to share my experience with others and realized I wasn t alone. My friends and colleagues opened up about their own postpartum struggles and shared resources. But even with a strong support network. and two incomes supporting our household. I had to fight to access basic mental health services.When I think about the fall of Roe. I think that I  did everything right  in planning for a family. and yet. I almost lost my life. For the people with far less than I. how will they cope with something as life-altering as becoming a parent. without any support? Raising a family in America is an adversarial process. If you don t have time. money. familial support. an understanding employer with guaranteed income. great health insurance and you and your baby are fortunate enough to avoid any medical complications. you might not make it. By placing people who don t want to become parents into this situation. we guarantee more children will suffer in poverty while their parents struggle to exist in a system that sets them up for failure. And while I overcame my battle with postpartum depression. many parents won t. Forced parenthood won t provide parents paid parental leave to care for their children. Forced birthwon t guarantee homes for children struggling in the system or surviving in abusive households. Stripping parents of reproductive healthcare won t ensure their child has healthcare. The death of Roe won t save a single life. Rather. it guarantees more parents will suffer silently. or worse. until they lose the battle that I narrowly won.If you or someone you know needs help. dial 988 or call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Have you ever looked at pictures of your high school self and longed to look like that again? Or maybe you found a pair of pants in your closet that you know don t fit. but you can t make yourself donate them because you want to get back to that size.Letting go of our previous bodies (or even the body we never had. but wish we did) is an emotional thing. And no wonder: We live in a society where thinness is praised and seen as morally better. even though weight isn t a moral issue.If you re longing for the body you wish you had. you may be struggling with  body grief.  You may notice body grief mostly pops up when you re accepting what your body looks like now (or trying to). Body grief is the distress caused by the perceived losses that come when you stop attempting to change your body size.  said Bri Campos. a body image educator and the founder of Body Image With Bri.  Body grief is the loss of the ‘thin ideal  and can be the loss of a body size you used to have. While people who experience fatphobia. chronic illness. other forms of discrimination or eating disorder recovery might be most affected. anyone can struggle with body grief. Campos said.She shared other times when you may experience it:Campos noted body grief isn t just weight-related. either. you may also feel it when you lose physical strength or motility.Other than feelings of loss. body grief can lead to social challenges and make you wonder what you truly want: wellness or being thin.  It can cause feelings of questioning identity. social isolation. hopelessness. no light at the end of the tunnel.  Campos said.The effects of body grief are. therefore. far-reaching.  Body grief also includes grieving the loss of all the amazing things you imagined would happen once you achieved your ideal body.  said Samantha DeCaro. a clinical psychologist and the director of clinical outreach and education at The Renfrew Center.  It may also involve grieving the precious time. energy and money lost to the pursuit of a weight. shape. size or appearance that was ultimately never meant to be. or deeply regretting the times you ignored or punished your body for not looking a certain way. Since attempts to change your body can also be a cover-up for trauma and anxiety. those struggles may come up again as you dedicate less brain space to dieting or similar behaviors.  Using mental space to think about your body can function as a distraction from other deeply painful thoughts or emotions. so body grief might also involve grieving the loss of a powerful avoidance strategy.  DeCaro explained.Unfortunately. body grief is one of those things that may get worse before it gets better. Like other types of grief and recovery. there are ups and downs. For lots of people. body grief can deepen dissociation and detachment from our bodies. especially as we work through painful or heavy emotions.  said Meredith Nisbet. a national clinical response manager and certified eating disorders specialist with Eating Recovery Center. She explained you may experience physical aches and pains along with the emotional ones. We can also expect that the experience of body grief will not be linear. and must be moved through intentionally and with compassion for ourselves and our bodies.  she added.So what are some intentional. compassionate ways to deal with that grief? Here are tips you can try on your own or with a therapist.First. I want to validate that for people experiencing weight discrimination — aka people who lose out on jobs because of their weight. can t fit into most stores  clothes. fear going to the doctor because the doctor blames every single problem on their weight. etc. ― being thinner would likely yield a different outcome. and struggling with that is valid. Also. remember that s a problem with society — not you or your body — and that weight loss isn t healthy. good or achievable for everyone. anyway.Other than that. know weight loss isn t the answer we sometimes (understandably) dream it is.  We often tell ourselves things like. ‘If I could only have [this type of body]. I would be happy. I would be successful. people would like me more. my partner would love me more.   said Amber Claudon. Lightfully Behavioral Health s vice president of clinical training.  With these desires and associations. we begin to correlate the voids in our lives to the lack of body changes that we might pursue or chase. Unfortunately. this pursuit is futile and never-ending. it perpetuates feelings of defeat and despair. DeCaro blames this on the diet industry.  The diet industry sells us the lie that our basic human wants and needs like love. happiness. respect and belonging will all be part of the package once we hit our ‘body goals.   she said. So. we have to find success. meaningful relationships. health and happiness in other ways. whether that s through hobbies. spending time with loved ones. exercising for fun rather than punishment or something else.Did you know the idea that  thin is best  actually has racist origins?  As early as the 1600s. society deemed certain bodies desirable. moral and ideal. According to Sabrina Strings s ‘Fearing the Black Body.  the most hated and undesirable bodies were those of fat Black women.  Campos explained.The thin ideal isn t even health-related. We know from research that body size isn t the sole predictor of health. people can be healthy in differently sized bodies. The BMI scale is racist. too. and not an accurate way to measure health.Also. let s not forget that people are out there trying to make us feel insecure so we ll give them our money. (Uh. no thanks.) Campos shared the diet culture industry is worth $72 billion. Campos uses a four-part framework to help her clients navigate grief:DeCaro also believes in the importance of accepting your feelings and realizing they won t last forever.  It can be helpful to remember that all emotions are temporary. and avoidance tends to make emotions stronger in the long run.  she said. She suggested talking about it. journaling. crying. expressing your pain through art. finding a safe community and/or therapist. living into your other values and more. The best encouragement I have for someone struggling with body grief is to practice radical compassion towards yourself.  Nisbet said.  This is your one body. your one life. and cultivating gentleness and forgiveness towards your body can help you come home to yourself.  She encouraged you to spend some quiet time with your body. breathing and practicing grounding techniques. Courageously choosing body grief can be an uphill battle that is lonely and isolating in a fatphobic society.  Claudon said.  We must get to the root of the issue versus attempting to control our bodies in a way that is [hollow] and perpetuates self-hate and shame. ,Health News

expanding monkeypox outbreakscarce vaccinesAlthough monkeypox has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades. it was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May. when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe. North America and elsewhere.Declaring a global emergencyThe emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak. Past announcements had mixed impact. given that the U.N. health agency is largely powerless in getting countries to act.Last month. WHO s expert committee said the worldwide monkeypox outbreak did not yet amount to an international emergency. but the panel convened this week to reevaluate the situation.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. more than 16.000 cases of monkeypox have been reported in 74 countries since about May. To date. monkeypox deaths have only been reported in Africa. where a more dangerous version of the virus is spreading. mainly in Nigeria and Congo.In Africa. monkeypox mainly spreads to people from infected wild animals like rodents. in limited outbreaks that typically have not crossed borders. In Europe. North America and elsewhere. however. monkeypox is spreading among people with no links to animals or recent travel to Africa.WHO s top monkeypox expert. Dr. Rosamund Lewis. said this week that 99% of all the monkeypox cases beyond Africa were in men and that of those. 98% involved men who have sex with men. Experts suspect the monkeypox outbreaks in Europe and North America were spread via sex at two raves in Belgium and Spain.Michael Head. a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University. said it was surprising WHO hadn t already declared monkeypox a global emergency. explaining that the conditions were arguably met weeks ago.Some experts have questioned whether such a declaration would help. arguing the disease isn t severe enough to warrant the attention and that rich countries battling monkeypox already have the funds to do so. most people recover without needing medical attention. although the lesions may be painful. I think it would be better to be proactive and overreact to the problem instead of waiting to react when it s too late.  Head said. He added that WHO s emergency declaration could help donors like the World Bank make funds available to stop the outbreaks both in the West and in Africa. where animals are the likely natural reservoir of monkeypox.entrenched sexually transmitted disease The bottom line is we ve seen a shift in the epidemiology of monkeypox where there s now widespread. unexpected transmission.  said Dr. Albert Ko. a professor of public health and epidemiology at Yale University.  There are some genetic mutations in the virus that suggest why that may be happening. but we do need a globally-coordinated response to get it under control.  he said.Ko called for testing to be immediately scaled up rapidly. saying that similar to the early days of COVID-19. that there were significant gaps in surveillance. The cases we are seeing are just the tip of the iceberg.  he said.  The window has probably closed for us to quickly stop the outbreaks in Europe and the U.S.. but it s not too late to stop monkeypox from causing huge damage to poorer countries without the resources to handle it. In the U.S.. some experts have speculated that monkeypox might become entrenched there as the newest sexually transmitted disease. with officials estimating that 1.5 million men are at high risk of being infected.Dr. Placide Mbala. a virologist who directs the global health department at Congo s Institute of National Biomedical Research. said he hoped any global efforts to stop monkeypox would be equitable. Although countries including Britain. Canada. Germany and the U.S. have ordered millions of vaccine doses. none have gone to Africa. The solution needs to be global.  Mbala said. adding that any vaccines sent to Africa would be used to target those at highest risk. like hunters in rural areas. Vaccination in the West might help stop the outbreak there. but there will still be cases in Africa.  he said.  Unless the problem is solved here. the risk to the rest of the world will remain. ,Health News
As I heard the sci-fi clangs and bellows of the MRI scanner. all that rang through my mind was the near-familiarity of this experience. As a neuro-oncologist. I have often listened to my patients  experiences in MRI scanners. from the loud noises to the claustrophobic abyss. and seen their anxiety that preceded the results. Though I have had MRIs before. this time felt different. possibly because of the proximity to my own neurological awareness and because of the intimacy of having this scan performed in my own hospital s facility. When the phone rang the next day and my otolaryngologist said the words.  You have an acoustic neuroma.  I surprisingly phewed a sigh of relief. Because my aunt. grandmother. and great-aunt all died of what was likely glioblastoma. I have cautiously expected the most-feared of malignant brain tumors and anticipated that someday I would hear those fateful words. In actuality. all I could think was that as long as it wasn t a glioblastoma. I would readily accept any other diagnosis.After the diagnosis. the whiteboard in my mind was a flurry with pro/con list-making. I distilled my experiences with other patients and ultimately decided to pursue surgery at the outset. At the same time. the chasm in my physician-patient body opened ― how would I cope from brain tumor surgery and would I set a good example for my patients by maintaining resilience through the process? On a crisp October day. I entered the hospital. ready for the 7.5-hour surgery. knowing that I would lose hearing on my right side. cautious about preservation of my facial function. but most of all. eager to have the tumor out. When I awoke and discovered my facial function had been largely preserved. I was relieved: I ve always valued my smile. I heard the typical post-operative whooshing tinnitus and vomited four times immediately after receiving my first intravenous steroid dose. In the hundreds of patients I ve ordered dexamethasone for. I d never heard of anyone vomiting. despite this apparently well-known idiosyncratic effect.Unfortunately. those weren t the last of the post-operative complications. Salty spinal fluid started dripping out of my nose and down my throat. and I spent 12 days in the hospital to address this problem. One of my attendings during neurology residency often said that complex hospitalized patients needed to go on  all the rides.  The same could be said of me. cast in the role of the patient in a hospital drama where I was usually the one standing at the bedside. Though these days in bed were by no means pleasant. the journey awakened my inner physician. allowing me to diagnose each new setback and formulate a plan of action. After I was hospitalized for 12 days and lost 11 pounds during that time. I realized just how feeble one can be after spending so long in bed ― and with so many days of nausea and lack of sleep. Flashbacks to my patients  requests to see the physical therapist more than twice a week encircled me. I. too. longed for a better position to eat in bed. For the first time in my medical career. I truly internalized that patients often measure their care not in billable procedures and medical decision-making but in predictable simplicities. I chose the next days  meals each afternoon. timed my teams  morning rounds within a 5-minute window. and squinted up at the clock each evening at 11 p.m. just as I was awoken by the nurse to take my evening vital signs. Even more. I processed my experience in the context of my patients. an  ah ha  bell ringing daily with the newly recognized truths they told me as I sat across from them in clinic. I was discharged on a blindingly sunny November day. hoping for a bumpless ride home with my head wrap precariously positioned against the back seat. After settling into my new routine. all that preoccupied my mind was returning to my lab and clinic. taking my own diagnosis out of the limelight and lowering this whole journey to background noise. What I didn t expect in the days and weeks after my surgery was how much this experience would inform my practice. As a junior attending. I routinely convey brain tumor diagnoses or sit across from my patients as they tell me all they want to do is go home. all the while helping them mentally cope with their cancer. Gradually. I began to glimpse the hospital environment from the vantage point of a physician-patient. zooming out from the day-to-day bustle on the wards and magnifying the alterations that this journey has had on my professional encounters.Recently. a patient was fearful of undergoing brain tumor surgery. afraid of what she would feel like afterward and apprehensive of surgical site pain. Without a moment wasted. I chimed in.  I went through this same surgery. and here I am in front of you. doing just fine.  I felt a sigh of relief from my patient. as though our therapeutic alliance had morphed into a familial connection. I began to ponder when to share ― and consider not sharing ― details of my journey. For example. I recognize that my diagnosis of a benign brain tumor may pale in comparison to the incurable malignancies growing within many of my patients  brains. Even worse. my surgical cure may be at odds with their experiences and may be counterproductive to an empathic therapeutic connection. Likewise. I am careful not to shift the focus of my patient encounters to me: Office visits are meant to address their concerns. not to coerce them into a provider role to facilitate my own recovery. Even when not sharing my own experience. I have found that patients  stories can be quite triggering. Recently. a patient told me that after she returned home from her own brain tumor surgery. she fainted in the tub after showering for the first time. She said the heat and flowing water were all too much for her. As I heard her story. I felt immediate resonance. When I stumbled into the shower awkwardly for the first time after surgery. holding onto the curtain rod to step in and the towel bar to steady myself amid the rush of warm water over my body. I felt like a clumsy skeleton. The sensation felt somewhat allodynic but also refreshing. as if the water was cleansing off nearly two weeks of hospital gunk. With these experiences. I have learned that sharing my story is not without risks ― of over-sharing. of my own vulnerabilities coming out. and even of triggering encounters. for myself and my patients. I even wondered whether these triggering experiences would alienate me from my patients. forcing me to bury my own medical record. But having been on the receiving end of a difficult diagnosis. of tiptoeing into an MRI machine. and of having a tumor tweezed out of my brain. I know that shielding myself from my patients backfires. preventing ignition of a therapeutic  on  switch. Personal stories of my physicians and friends living with single-sided deafness or hearing about coping strategies for dizziness were the fuel in my recovery engine. Though I don t have a precise algorithm for when to share my own experience as a patient in neuro-oncology. I generally rely on cues from my patients as a guide. Some patients may be afraid of undergoing surgery. not understanding what a surgical scar might feel or look like in the weeks after surgery. Some patients may worry about post-operative pain or wonder what it s like to lose hearing on one side. In these instances. I find that my experience can help them prepare for surgery. taking the edge off the anxiety of proceeding with a major surgery. I emphasize that undergoing brain tumor resection. recovering from surgery. and learning how to return to life is difficult ― but possible. I talk about the problems I have faced with unilateral deafness. or how to regain balance. or to make sure to eat as well as possible in the hospital. I emphasize physical therapy for the wondrous benefit it had on my return to work and life. So far. I have shared my experience with about half a dozen patients in whom I sensed fear and apprehension about brain tumor surgery or their post-operative recovery. I have leveraged my own experience not to convince patients of my clinical recommendations. but to illuminate one possible path of recovery. In all of these situations. I feel that this sharing has helped ― rather than harmed ― the relationship with my patients. Though not all physicians commiserate with their patients  journeys. we all bring our personal lives to our patients ― whether we admit it or not. What I find most useful when looking through the lens of this past year is that thoughtful sharing can humanize us in the eyes of our patients. Our patients look to us not just for our professional opinion but often our personal opinion on the right direction of care. And sharing direct medical experience as a patient or loved one can ring true for them. validating these opinions and comforting our patients during isolating periods of decision-making. As a physician. this process has taught me that our experiences can be relevant to our patients and that appropriate sharing is a powerful means to better connect with our patients. Having been strapped into the metal mask atop the MRI gurney before my surgery and waking up with a C-shaped line of sutures concealed behind my ear after surgery. I now consider this experience perhaps the most useful tool that I can bring to my clinic.

In June. Kat and Mitchell Delancey s newborn son died as a result of infection with parechovirus. a common but little-known virus they told the New York Times they were  blindsided  by.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory about parechovirus last week. stating that it had received multiple reports of infections since May. The CDC recommended doctors consider the virus as a possible diagnosis when caring for infants presenting with fever. sepsis or seizures and other more common symptoms like rash and lethargy.Here s what parents need to know now.Unlike COVID-19. parechovirus is not a new disease. and serious complications are usually limited to infants less than 3 months old.  Parechovirus are common viral infections that are in the same family as enteroviruses.  said Dr. Jen Trachtenberg. a board-certified pediatrician. Like other enteroviruses. parechovirus often causes no symptoms. or only mild ones.  Infections tend to occur early in life.  said Dr. Ruth Kanthula. a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at MedStar Health. Most children have been infected by age 5. she said. although they may never exhibit symptoms.There are at least 19 types of parechovirus. and it is often seen in summer and fall. although it can occur year round. All samples tested by the CDC recently were the A3 variant of the virus. which is associated with more serious symptoms. Because the CDC doesn t normally track parechovirus. it s hard to know if cases have actually gone up this year or whether an increase in testing for the virus has led to more cases being identified. Symptoms of parechovirus can range from non-existent to mild to severe. explained Kanthula. Babies and young children are most likely to exhibit symptoms. which may include fever and rash. upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose and cough. or gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. Most children  recover fully with supportive care like fluids for hydration. fever/pain reliever as needed. and some extra rest.  said Trachtenberg.In more serious cases. parechovirus can cause respiratory illness such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis. an inflammation of the small airways in infants. Neurological complications such as meningitis and encephalitis can also occur. and it s possible for the virus to affect other organs such as the heart. liver or kidneys.Kanthula said that there have been reports of abnormal neurodevelopment in children who had neurological complications or sepsis — a state of severe infection — as a result of parechovirus. meaning that it s possible these complications had a long-term impact on the brain. This outcome is rare. however. as are deaths.Severe cases generally occur in babies less than 3 months old. and particularly in those less than 1 month old. Trachtenberg said. People with weakened immune systems may also be at risk. Parechovirus is just one of many viruses and bacteria that can cause serious illness in infants.  Infections in this age group can spread throughout the body quickly because of the size of the infant and [their] developing immune system.  Kanthula said. Unfortunately. there are no antiviral treatments for parechovirus or vaccines to prevent its spread. Sick children may be given medication to reduce their fever as well as fluids to stay hydrated. When it comes to young infants. the guidelines for when to consult a doctor are no different for parechovirus than any other illness.  A baby under 3 months with fever over 100.4 [who is] not feeding. pale. lethargic. very cranky. or [in] respiratory distress — that baby should be seen and evaluated by their pediatrician.  said Trachtenberg.Other symptoms that you should report to your pediatrician include diarrhea and dehydration. blood in stool. distended abdomen. decreased urine output. mottled skin. or feeling warm and clammy to the touch. Any baby less than 6 weeks old who has a fever should be evaluated by a doctor. Kanthula added.Parents should be aware that. because young infants are more vulnerable. a visit to the ER may include more testing than they would expect for similar symptoms in an older child. Doctors may collect blood and urine samples and even order a spinal tap to check for signs of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid. which surrounds the spine and brain. Families can prevent parechovirus by using the same methods they ve become accustomed to over the past two years. Because the virus is found in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. frequent hand-washing with soap for at least 20 seconds is key. Masking can also reduce the spread via airborne droplets.Such measures will protect against parechovirus and many other diseases. including COVID-19. It s particularly important to take these precautions during the first four weeks of your child s life.  As a pediatrician. I urge parents to limit baby s contact with many guests. anyone sick. or young children that can pass on germs during the newborn period.  Trachtenberg said. ,Health News
heatwavechildrenbabiesHeatstroke is a serious condition which needs to be treated as an emergency and can occur in anyone. There are similarities in the way heatstroke presents in adults and children. but some are more common in the latter. Here are the signs to watch out for.Kidshealthdrinking enough fluids.Although painful. heat cramps on their own aren t serious. But cramps can be the first sign of more serious heat illness. so they should be treated right away to help avoid any problems.The signs of heat exhaustion include:a headacheThe symptoms are often the same in adults and children. although children may become floppy and sleepy.If someone is showing signs of heat exhaustion. they need to be cooled down.The most severe form of heat illness is heatstroke. Heatstroke is a life-threatening medical emergency.In a heatstroke. the body cannot regulate its own temperature. Body temperature can soar to 105 degrees F or even higher. leading to brain damage or even death if it isn t quickly treated. Quick medical care is needed to bring the body temperature under control.Kids are at risk for heatstroke if they overdress or do intense physical activity in hot weather without drinking enough liquids.Heatstroke also can happen when a child is left in. or gets trapped in. a car on a hot day. When the outside temperature is 93 degrees F. the temperature inside a car can reach 125 degrees in just 20 minutes. quickly raising body temperature to dangerous levels.Call for emergency medical help if your child has been outside in extreme temperatures or another hot environment and shows one or more of these symptoms of heatstroke:severe headacheIf someone has heat exhaustion. follow these four steps:Move them to a cool place.Stay with them until they re better. They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes.There s a high risk of heat exhaustion or heatstroke during hot weather or exercise.To help prevent heat exhaustion or heatstroke:drink plenty of cold drinks. especially when exercisingdehydrationKeep an eye on children. the elderly and people with long-term health conditions (like diabetes or heart problems) because they re more at risk of heat exhaustion or heatstroke.,Health News
If you were disturbed by  The Handmaid s Tale.  the dystopian story of a totalitarian regime that treats women as property and values them entirely based on their ability to produce babies. you should see what s going on in Congress right now.In the past week alone. House Republicans have overwhelmingly voted against a woman s right to travel for abortion care. to access birth control and to marry someone they love.Each of these votes was appalling in its own right.When the House voted last week to ensure that women are able to travel across state lines for an abortion. 205 Republicans voted no. When the House voted Tuesday to codify same-sex marriage. 157 Republicans voted no. On Thursday. when the House voted to protect women s right to access birth control and other contraception. 195 Republicans voted no.Taken together. the broader message that Republicans are sending with these votes is even more horrifying: Women should be viewed as little more than baby incubators.House Democratic leaders lined up votes on all of these bills in direct response to the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade last month. breaking from 50 years of precedent to deny women a constitutional right to an abortion. Republicans in Congress argued that none of these bills are necessary because the right to birth control and the right to same-sex marriage are safe. In no way. shape or form is access to contraception limited or at risk of being limited.  Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) said during Thursday s debate on the birth control bill.  The liberal majority is clearly trying to stoke fears and mislead the American people once again because in their minds stoking fear clearly is the only way that they can win. But this is the same thing Republicans said about Roe v. Wade. And there s no reason to think the current crop of conservatives on the Supreme Court ― all of whom are there because of their ties to the very anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ legal organization. the Federalist Society ― won t try to roll back more of these protections. They ve said so themselves. In future cases. we should reconsider all of this Court s substantive due process precedents. including Griswold. Lawrence. and Obergefell.  Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion when the court overturned Roe v. Wade. He was referring to the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception). Lawrence (sexual conduct with a member of the same sex) and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito previously called for revisiting same-sex couples  constitutional right to marry. too. In October 2020. they said the court s 2015 decision on marriage equality was  undemocratic  and that  the court has created a problem that only it can fix. Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) said Thursday that it s not hard to connect the dots between what the Supreme Court just did and what Republicans in Congress are making very clear they d like to do when it comes to legislating what women can and can t do with their bodies. When Clarence Thomas said he wanted to take away a woman s right to birth control. some told me that is just his opinion.  Kim tweeted.  But now I saw 195 of my Republican colleagues reject protection for contraceptives. This is not just an opinion of one man. This is their plan. Even GOP Rep. Nancy Mace (S.C.). who opposes abortion rights and who celebrated when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. said that barring women from having access to birth control is a step too far. She was one of just During the House vote on that bill. Mace wore a sign on her back that read.  My state is banning EXCEPTIONS. Protect CONTRACEPTION.  My state is banning almost all exceptions for women including who ve been raped & victims of incest. Today I voted to protect access to contraceptives ― to protect every woman in South Carolina.  Mace tweeted.  You can t ban abortion and then not protect women s access to contraceptives. Despite so many Republicans voting against these bills. they all passed because Democrats hold the majority. But there s a good chance Republicans will win control of the House in November. That would put Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) ― both of whom just voted against protecting women s rights to travel. to birth control. to abortion care ― in charge of setting the chamber s agenda.just introduced a billOf course. even if Republicans win control of the House in the midterms. they d have to win control of the Senate. too. to control all of Congress. And even in that scenario. Joe Biden will still be in the White House until at least 2024. That means even a GOP-led Congress wouldn t be able to pass laws rolling back these kinds of protections for women until a willing Republican is in the White House.But if this week showed anything. it s that Clarence Thomas is not an isolated case of a conservative ready to strip fundamental protections from women in order to make them more likely to get pregnant. stay pregnant and make babies. It s virtually everyone in the House Republican conference.,Health News
The current COVID-19 variants are more transmissible than ever. leading to a higher rate of infection throughout the country and increased risk associated with most activities. he current variants. which are BA.4 and BA.5. constitute for about 82% of our current variants within our health system.  Dr. Janak Patel. director of the Division of Infectious Disease and Immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch. told HuffPost.The current strains are unique for reasons beyond their transmissibility. too. They also can cause some different symptoms compared to earlier strains of the virus.Here. experts share the COVID-19 symptoms that are most common right now and other differences they ve seen with these current variants.David SoulelesSore throats are very commonly reported.  he said.However. it s important to remember that this may not be exclusive to BA.5. It takes the scientific community time to compile recent infection data since variants change so quickly. Souleles said. And the medical community doesn t know on an individual patient level who has what variant. Plus. if you test with an at-home test. there s no way of knowing what variant you had.Dr. Pritish ToshBut. Souleles said  if you talk to the average person who had COVID. many will tell you it s the sickest they ve ever been without going to the hospital.  Think persistent headache. frequent cough and restless nights as a result. Plus. the overwhelming anxiety that having COVID-19 brings. Additionally. there s also the risk of long COVID. It s estimated that about 16 million people may have the condition after being infected with the virus. So. even though the symptoms may be described as or seen as mild. there are still issues that can happen. Loss of taste and smell was a very common symptom that was reported in earlier variants of COVID-19.  Souleles said.  We re hearing that a lot less than we used to. This likely has to do with how the virus has mutated. and how it interacts with the parts of our brain that govern taste and smell. he added.According to Souleles. people are testing positive after exposure at a faster rate than earlier in the pandemic. A year ago. it  might have been more like seven to 10 days after their exposure period.  he said. Now. most people will test positive three to five days after exposure.  We re definitely seeing a more rapid progression to symptoms after exposure.  [BA.5] is a variant that can evade antibodies from other recent variants.  Tosh said.But. the reason most people aren t experiencing outcomes like hospitalizations or death has to do with the built-up immunity that many of us have. whether that s from vaccinations. prior infections or both. And that protection goes beyond antibodies. it s also because of our T-cell immunity. which increases every time we get vaccinated. boosted or infected.  Antibodies keep people from getting infected.  Tosh explained.  T-cells keep people from getting super sick  and requiring hospital care.T-cells are far more robust in keeping people from getting very sick from different variants. including from the current BA.5 subvariant. We know that the vaccines continue to provide pretty good protection from the more serious outcomes that would result in hospitalization or death.  Souleles said. And when you look at hospital data across the country. the majority of folks who end up in the hospital because of COVID-19 are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated. [Unvaccinated people] are getting more of those severe outcomes that we might have seen earlier in the pandemic when we didn t have vaccines or medicines like Paxlovid.  he said. Keep in mind that it s not guaranteed that unvaccinated people will become more ill. there is just a higher chance that they will face more severe outcomes.100.000 hospitalizedRoughly 3% of the countryhealth conditionsface severe outcomesThat s why it s important for immunocompromised individuals to get all of their vaccinations and for everyone to follow smart health precautions — especially when coming into contact with someone who is high risk.Vaccinate. boost. wear a mask. test before attending events. test three to five days after you have had a known exposure. and isolate if you re sick. Souleles said.  All of those things that have applied throughout the entire pandemic apply to BA.5 and all of the variants of omicron. We have the tools to control this. we know what to do. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication. but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

Wooten said.  Even normal activity for these dogs can be harmful. so keep at-risk dogs inside as much as possible when the heat index is 85 degrees or higher. Also. greyhounds are at increased risk of heat distress than other breeds. Lastly. don t shave double-coated dogs. Their fur actually can protect them from heat ― Australian shepherds. huskies. goldens. collies. corgis. etc. ZoetisAskeland recommended seeing if you can comfortably place your hand on the ground and hold it for 10 seconds. While some dog boots can prevent paws coming in contact with the hot surface. it may simply be too hot to walk your dog regardless of paw protection.  she added.If you determine it s safe to take your dog for a walk on a hot day. make sure to carry lots of water with you and offer it throughout the outing. Focus on hydration throughout the summer as well.  Always keep them hydrated.  Wooten said.  In addition to always having water on hand. you can also offer small amounts of water-rich fruit. like melons or berries. You can also add water to their dry kibble to increase hydration. or toss ice cubes made with chicken broth in the water bowl to entice them to drink more.  If it is very hot. it s better to walk very early or very late in the day to avoid the extreme temperatures and direct sun.  Askeland said.Going out during cooler times of day and keeping those walks short is best for your dog s health. Full Moon Pet Treat the walks as a chance to stroll and sniff instead of trying to move quickly or cover a lot of ground.  Askeland added.  There are some helpful items you can purchase. such as bandanas or vests that can be put in the freezer. to help your pet stay cool.  Berst noted. A cooling vest or neck wrap can provide relief and protection from the sun. You just soak it in cold water. wring it out and then place it on your dog. Through the process of evaporation. heat is released and there s a cooling effect similar to sweating for humans. Cooling vests can be useful to help keep a dog cool during a walk. but most cooling vests will not last very long.  Askeland cautioned.Additionally. cooling gel mats and beds are a good option for your dog to use when you return home from a walk.Small Door VeterinaryWooten also offered a DIY toy option for overheated dogs.  You can freeze water in soda bottles. wrap them in socks. and place them on the floor for the dog to lie beside.  she said.  If you do decide to walk your dog on a very hot day. consider doing things that you like to do to personally stay cool yourself on a hot day.  Berst advised.  For example. pick a shaded route or walk on grass versus pounding the payment. Take breaks throughout your outing to cool down in shady areas as well. Dogs often continue to move. even when they re getting overheated.  Dogs that are avid ball chasers or otherwise very active may not regulate their activity because they re so focused on chasing the ball.  Wooten noted.  So you will need to do it for them. Monitor when your dog has had enough and be sure to take a break. Wooten also suggested using sun protection. Dogs can get sunburned. so apply dog sunscreen ― yes. it is a thing! ― and bring an extra umbrella. or make sure there s some shade to avoid sunburn or heat stroke.  she said. Generally. heat exhaustion is a milder form of heat stroke.  Askeland explained. adding that it s important to know the signs and monitor your dog when they re outside. Pay attention to see if they re ever lagging behind. looking for shade. trying to sit down or hyperventilating.  A dog may pant heavily. seek water. and take breaks during a walk.  Askeland noted.  These are signs a dog may have heat exhaustion and you should cease the activity. get to a cool area and offer water ― but don t force your dog to drink. Heat exhaustion can quickly progress to heat stroke. so it s important to monitor your dog. take its temperature. and go to your veterinarian immediately if symptoms worsen. She noted that dogs with heat stroke can have a high temperature. rapid breathing. bright red gums and tongue. dry or tacky gums. and may have trouble balancing or even collapse. Other symptoms include vomiting. excessive drooling. uncontrollable panting and lethargy. If heat stroke is a concern. a dog owner should apply cool. wet cloths to the dog s skin and get to a veterinary hospital immediately.  Askeland said. What you feed your dog before and after your walk can help counteract the effects of the hot weather.  Many dogs love ice cubes as a crunchy treat.  Richardson noted.  You can also give them frozen chunks of watermelon or other melon. Just ensure the rind and any seeds are removed. as these can pose a choking hazard. Like ice cubes. these have the added bonus of a high water content ― very useful to keep your pet hydrated on a hot day. She recommended using your ice trays to freeze chicken or beef broth (as long as it s low sodium. fat-free and doesn t contain onion or garlic) or coconut water with strawberries or blueberries. Another option: buy the dog-friendly  ice cream  that pet brands sell. or make it yourself by mixing mashed-up banana. unsweetened plain yogurt and a tablespoon of creamy peanut butter and freezing it for a few hours.  You could also make fruity ‘pupsicles  by diluting fruit juice. so it s not too sugary.  Richardson added.  Ensure the juice does not contain any artificial sweeteners like xylitol ― it s toxic to dogs. the Kong brand s signature toy Stuff a Kong toy with a soft food and freeze it to create a tasty. long-lasting treat.  Richardson suggested.  Good options include unsweetened plain yoghurt. some mashed banana. canned pumpkin. mashed sweet potato. or canned pet food.   When it s very hot. you may not be able to safely walk your dog and can look to indoor games and activities to help your pet get some exercise and mental stimulation.  Askeland noted. She suggested games like hide and seek. in which you hide and your dog finds you. or a scavenger hunt where hide treats. toys or even their meals throughout the house. Set up an indoor obstacle course using pillows. boxes. or other household items.  she added.  Or do short training sessions. Brush up on your dog s cues or teach them a new trick! Wooten noted that very active dogs can be trained to run on indoor treadmills as well.  If your dog is comfortable. go swimming or engage in water-related activities.  Wooten recommended.  When at home. you can set up a sprinkler. mister or kiddie pool for them to play in. Keep in mind though for lakes. pools and other bodies of water: When the water is above 75 degrees. dogs can still overheat if they are exercising hard in the water. Whether indoors or outdoors. however. the most important thing is to take cues from your pet. Do not force your dog to exercise in the heat.  Wilhite said.  If they seem like they d rather not. it s a good time to take a day off. ,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — An unvaccinated young adult from New York recently contracted polio. the first U.S. case in nearly a decade. health officials said Thursday.Officials said the patient. who lives in Rockland County. had developed paralysis. The person developed symptoms a month ago and did not recently travel outside the country. county health officials said.It appears the patient had a vaccine-derived strain of the virus. perhaps from someone who got live vaccine — available in other countries. but not the U.S. — and spread it. officials said.The person is no longer deemed contagious. but investigators are trying to figure out how the infection occurred and whether other people may have been exposed to the virus.Most Americans are vaccinated against polio. but unvaccinated people may be at risk. said Rockland County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert. Health officials scheduled vaccination clinics nearby for Friday and Monday. and encouraged anyone who has not been vaccinated to get the shots. We want shots in the arms of those who need it.  she said at a Thursday press conference announcing the case.Polio was once one of the nation s most feared diseases. with annual outbreaks causing thousands of cases of paralysis — many of them in children.Vaccines became available starting in 1955. and a national vaccination campaign cut the annual number of U.S. cases to less than 100 in the 1960s and fewer than 10 in the 1970s. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 1979. polio was declared eliminated in the U.S.. meaning there was no longer routine spread.Rarely. travelers have brought polio infections into the U.S. The last such case was in 2013. when a 7-month-old who had recently moved to the U.S. from India was diagnosed in San Antonio. Texas. according the federal health officials. That child also had the type of polio found in the live form of vaccine used in other countries.two typesU.S. children are still routinely vaccinated against polio with the inactivated vaccine. Federal officials recommend four doses: to be given at 2 months of age. 4 months. at 6 to 18 months. and at age 4 through 6 years. Some states require only three doses.According to the CDC s most recent childhood vaccination data. about 93% of 2-year-olds had received at least three doses of polio vaccine.Polio spreads mostly from person to person or through contaminated water. It can infect a person s spinal cord. causing paralysis and possibly permanent disability and death. The disease mostly affects children.Polio is endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. although numerous countries in Africa. the Middle East and Asia have also reported cases in recent years.measles outbreakwarned parents___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

A few months ago. we believed recovering from COVID-19 meant the chances of getting the virus again so soon were low. Scientists thought we were protected for at least six months after the initial infection.But now. as the hyper-transmissible BA.5 variant whips around the country. more and more reinfections are being detected in people who ve already had COVID once. if not twice. before.  Reinfections are due to several reasons. including more relaxed safety precautions such as masking and social distancing. as well as declining antibody levels and additional viral mutations. which can result in immune escape by omicron sub-variants.  Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster. an assistant professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and advisor to the Illinois Department of Public Heath. told HuffPost. In addition to SARS-CoV-2. there are four other coronaviruses that circulate and cause the common cold. These viruses are known to reinfect people after an average of about 12 months. Though there was hope that we d eventually gain herd immunity against COVID. it appears that SARS-CoV-2 is behaving like the other coronaviruses that we re exposed to year after year.  Extrapolating from data with other coronaviruses. reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 variants are expected.  Penaloza-MacMaster said. pointing out that BA.5 also has several mutations on the spike protein that make it easier for the coronavirus to enter and attach to our cells. These mutations help it appear somewhat invisible to the antibodies that our body produced during previous infections and vaccinations.  That sets up for higher risks for people being less protected against getting any infection.  said Albert Shaw. Yale Medicine infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine.It s tough to pin down how soon people are susceptible to reinfection. Shaw said. That timing largely depends on when you were last vaccinated or boosted. the state of your immune system. your age and presence of underlying health conditions.The variant you were last infected with. and when. also impacts your risk of reinfection. A pre-print study from Qatar recently found that effectiveness of a pre-omicron infection (like delta or alpha) against a BA.5 infection was about 28% whereas effectiveness of an omicron infection against a BA.5 infection was closer to 80%. This most likely has to do with how many vaccines people had at the time and when people got infected. according to Julie Parsonnet. an infectious diseases epidemiologist with Stanford Medicine.  If you got infected with delta. you were infected a relatively long time ago. and if you were infected with omicron. you were infected relatively recently and that may mean your immunity may be a little bit better just because it hasn t waned over time.  Parsonnet said.Shaw said most people are still probably well-protected for a few months. but beyond six months. the immunity that prevents symptomatic infections is likely waning substantially. Some people have been reinfected in as little as four weeks. According to Parsonnet. no matter how many times someone has been infected. there is no way to ensure they are 100% safe from getting COVID again.  I don t think there s anyone out there who can say.  I m immune — I m just not going to get it.   Parsonnet said.Though we can t prevent reinfections (yet). the vast majority of them will be less severe since the body has memory immune responses that will likely stay intact for years. Penaloza-MacMaster said that though symptoms depend on the person. they may involve headache. difficulty breathing. coughing. fatigue. fever. among others — or no symptoms at all. The symptoms also depend on the variant and the amount of virus a person is exposed to. he added. At the same time. reinfections — even if they re less severe — may lead to new health issues. A pre-print study from Washington University School of Medicine recently found that repeat COVID infections increase the risk of persistent health issues — like lung and heart problems and digestive or kidney disorders — after the infection.  The potential for some unpredictable consequences for these organ systems probably increases with subsequent reinfections as well.  Shaw said.The vaccines and boosters still do a good job at keeping us safe from serious outcomes. even with the new variants. Vaccination triggers a more robust immune response against severe outcomes from COVID-19. which is why it s so crucial to stay up to date on booster shots.  It s clear that the vaccines and prior infections still protect against severe illness and serious illness. so that s the good side.  Parsonnet said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication. but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

That Thursday in the middle of March. some part of me already knew. That afternoon. at the end of our session. my therapist Gayle. asked what else needed attention. I mentioned my sister Tracey.  She s in a rough patch that just isn t getting better. I m worried.  It felt like a bookmark. something we would come back to in our next session. Tracey s depression was chronic. For most of her adult life she fought through loneliness. addiction and depression. Her seven siblings were her primary support. she had a check-in call with one of us each day. I m the youngest. I talked to her almost daily. but always on Thursday. That week. we had lunch together on Monday. Tracey. our sister Lisa and our Mom. What I remember is Tracey s energy that day ― her words were sharp. her tone brittle. She was miserable. wildly unsettled in her own skin. Lunch was awkward for the four of us.I remember Trace was rude to the server. frustrated at her being slow and a little bit clueless. I found myself feeling annoyed at my sister for her surly attitude.Mom was in an uncharacteristically good mood. telling stories and asking questions about preposterous things because she couldn t remember if they had really happened or if she had dreamed them. Lisa and I shared the neutral role that day. Engaging with Mom. trying to connect with Trace. Each of us sisters filed her stories away to dish about them with each other later. We each left from lunch. Tracey walking out a different door than we did. That week. I called her first thing Wednesday and left a voicemail. Her lack of response wasn t unusual. On bad days she didn t reach out much. On Thursday. I left voicemails in the morning and midday. As a mental health therapist in private practice. I was hard to reach during my work day. I called repeatedly in between client sessions. but didn t receive even a half-hearted text reply back to say she d received my calls and didn t want to talk. Curiosity turned to concern as the day went by without hearing from her. By 8:30 p.m.. when another attempt to reach her went unanswered. I knew something wasn t right. The silence was too loud.I texted Lisa. to see if she d heard from Trace that day. but she hadn t. We quickly surveyed our five brothers by text. No one had talked to her since Tuesday. Intuition rang a warning sound in my veins and tied knots in my belly. I felt an urgent. pressing need to go to her. I m going to her apartment.  I told Lisa on the phone.  I ll meet you there.  she promised.  I have a key. Driving the 10 minutes across town I added up the lack of contact. her unusual silence. I was afraid I knew what it meant. There really were only two possible scenarios. She would either be furious at us for waking her up at 10:15 p.m.. or she was dead. I turned into the apartment complex from the back entrance and saw lights on in Tracey s place. My chest folded in on itself in fear. seeing her apartment lit up was not a good omen.Lisa and I arrived at the same time and parked side by side. As we hurried up the short stairwell I said.  She s going to be so mad if we re waking her up.  I don t give a fuck how mad she is.  Lisa doesn t usually swear. so I found this oddly comforting. Tracey being pissed off was better than the alternative. We knocked. rang the doorbell. Nothing. With shaking hands. Lisa unlocked the door. We stepped inside. first Lisa then me. Turning the corner from the entryway into the living room. Lisa screamed.  Oh my god! Tracey. no! She was sitting in a chair in the corner of her living room. She appeared to be asleep. It was eerily peaceful. Not at all messy. We had no idea how long she d been there.The first call I make is to 911. Lisa feels for a pulse on Tracey s wrist and recoils from the cold skin. 911 answers and I panic that I can t remember her address.  It s my sister. She s dead. We just found her.  Stay with me here. Ma am. It s okay. We found your location. We re sending an officer now. Just stay on the line.  Lisa and I begin calling our brothers. She tells John and Toby. I call Bob and Pete. We can t reach Jeff. These are the hardest phone calls I ve ever made.When the police arrive. they enter the apartment and begin asking questions.  Is there any reason to suspect foul play?  No.  I answer.  This is exactly what it looks like. She had a history of prior attempts. She was depressed.  I want my sister back. I want to return to the last day I saw her. chase her down for the hug and kiss goodbye we didn t share that day. I want to confront her jagged. brittle energy. ask the questions I d avoided out of an unspoken bargain we d struck.Months before. I asked her point blank if she was suicidal. We were in a 50s-themed diner in the mall eating cheeseburgers and fries. She met my eyes and refused to answer. My follow-up question of whether she had a plan also went unanswered. I had to back off to keep her as close to me as she would allow. This uneasy balance went against my clinical therapist training and my desperate need for my big sister in my life.The medical examiner comes to talk with us.  Your sister probably died late on Wednesday.  she explains. citing her body temperature. etc. She hands out her business cards in case we have questions later. The transport vehicle arrives to move my sister s body out of the apartment. I can t make myself watch the gurney covered in a white sheet. But I also can t quite ignore it. Once they re gone. we go back in. My great grandmother s ring. the one Tracey wore every day. sits alone on the table beside the chair where she died. I wish you could feel the way I loved my sister. The way she d ramble on my voicemail. always starting with.  Hey Meg. it s Trace.  The way she laughed and her grumpy face of displeasure. All those mediocre sandwiches at Subway because for a while that s all she ate.Tracey could walk into a room and know immediately how things should be arranged. Together we d move tall shelves full of books and framed photos without emptying them first. Sometimes we d take off the most breakable things. Often not. We were daring.Tracey was fragile. already broken in some ways. I knew that. but I still chose to believe she would stay. Some days I can t believe she had the strength to go through with it. that she didn t reach out one more time to any of her seven siblings. her parents.Did she hear my last voicemail? The one where my voice was stilted and awkward as I worked hard not to say.  I hope you re having a good day.  because I knew she wasn t. Tracey s days were lonely and painful. Her only reprieve was time with any of us. and it wasn t enough.Part of how she spent those last days was searching the internet. After her death. we looked at her browser history and found phrases like: weight loss programs. asphyxiation with helium. Had she also searched for suicide hotlines ― local or regional talk lines? There wasn t a simple number to call. she would have had to look up a crisis line. But Tracey didn t seem to have been seeking support. her mind was made up. I m mad at her for leaving even as I understand. I m mad that we had to be the ones to find her. the ones to make the horrendous calls to our brothers. But mostly I just miss her. I want her here. I m not done being her little sister. I m not finished yet.A few weeks after Tracey died I was asked by a friend of a friend how many siblings I have. The answer stuck in my throat. the number eight pounding its own pulse in my splintered heart.  There are eight of us.  I sputtered. There wasn t time or reason to tell the story. I couldn t wrap it in concise. polite words for someone who didn t know the gaping loss I ve experienced.Eight. There are eight of us. I am the youngest of eight siblings. I am always eight of eight.Now. seven years after my sister s death by suicide. a national helpline number has been designated for suicide support. By the time my sister made her exit plan. she wasn t looking for help to stay. but so many people are. The accessibility of 988 means no need to rely on Google searches. or hope your therapist made you save the county crisis line in your phone that last time you were struggling. Now. in the U.S.. someone struggling with suicidal thoughts can dial a simple three digit number to reach someone who can help. 988. It s eights. Because of course it is. If you or someone you know needs help. dial 988 or call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

SACRAMENTO. California (AP) — After putting off routine health care for much of the pandemic. Americans are now returning to doctors  offices in big numbers — a trend that s starting to show up in higher insurance rates across the country.Health insurers in individual marketplaces across 13 states and Washington D.C. will raise rates an average of 10% next year. according to a review of rate filings by the Kaiser Family Foundation.That s a big increase after premiums remained virtually flat for several years during the pandemic as insurers seek to recoup costs for more people using their policies. combined with record-high inflation that is driving up prices for virtually everything. including health care.The rates review included Georgia. Indiana. Iowa. Kentucky. Maryland. Michigan. Minnesota. New York. Oregon. Rhode Island. Texas. Vermont and Washington. We re at a point in the pandemic where people are using health care that they may have put off before.  said Larry Levitt. executive vice president for health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation.  We have a double whammy right now of people using more care and inflation throughout the economy. In California. state officials announced Tuesday that rates would increase an average of 6% next year for the 1.7 million people who purchase coverage through Covered California. the state-operated health insurance marketplace. That s a big jump after years of record low increases. when rate increases averaged about 1% in the past three years.Increased use of health plans was the biggest reason for the increase. accounting for four percentage points. according to Jessica Altman. executive director of Covered California. That is really the consistent message that other states are seeing as well. and even more so than California.  she said.About 14.5 million people purchased individual health coverage through state marketplaces this year. according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.That s a small portion of the total number of insured Americans. as about 155 million people get their insurance through their employer-sponsored coverage. But Kaiser said the filings for the individual plans are more detailed and publicly available.The annual open enrollment period for when customers can shop for and buy 2023 coverage starts this fall. That s the main window each year when people on the individual market can buy coverage or change plans.How much people will pay for coverage depends on a variety of factors. including where they live and what type of plans they choose.The rate increases come as Congress debates whether to extend financial help for consumers through the American Rescue Plan — the $1.9 trillion economic aid package Congress passed last year to combat the economic impacts of the pandemic.The American Rescue Plan included significant funding to keep health insurance premiums low for people who purchase coverage through state marketplaces.California receives about $1.7 billion annually from that funding to make sure no one paid more than 8.5% of their household income on monthly premiums.If that assistance expires at the end of this year. about 3 million Americans — including 220.000 Californians — would likely drop coverage because they will no longer be able to afford it. according to an analysis by Covered California.Without guidance on whether Congress will extend the assistance next year. some insurers have reacted by proactively raising rates in anticipation of people dropping coverage. The uncertainty accounted for half a percentage point of California s 6% increase. Altman said.California officials have lobbied hard for Congress to extend the financial assistance through the American Rescue Plan. In general. the price of health insurance premiums depends on who is buying coverage. If its mostly sick people. the premiums are more expensive. If more healthy people buy them. the premiums cost less.Altman said California has managed to keep its rate increases below the national average in part because more healthy people are buying coverage through Covered California than most other states.She said that s in part because of a California law that taxes people who refuse to purchase health coverage. But she said it s also because of subsidies that keep premiums low so more people can afford them.Altman said not extending the federal financial assistance would price some people out of coverage and  is the core outcome to be concerned about here.  That would be a big step backwards.  she said.___Associated Press health writer Tom Murphy in Indianapolis contributed to this report.,Health News
When it comes to iced versus hot coffee. conversations usually focus on personal taste. But what about health? Do the two versions of coffee affect the human body differently. and are the differences stark enough to warrant permanent changes in your caffeine consumption? To find out. HuffPost spoke with Dr. Majid Basit. a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann in Sugar Land. Texas. Basit said there isn t much research on the suBut more research needs to be done.  he added.A 2018 study in Scientific Reports bears that out. Researchers from Thomas Jefferson University found that hot coffee has higher levels of antioxidants. which can prevent or slow damage to cells. compared to cold brew. Caffeine is extremely variablehot brewing methods yield slightly higher caffeine Caffeine has both positive and negative effects on the body.  Basit explained.  It increases brain alertness and general energy levels. but will also increase the acid in the stomach leading to an upset stomach in some people.  The cardiologist also mentioned increased urination. blood pressure and heart rate. along with a decrease in the body s ability to absorb calcium. which may lead to lower bone density.To recap: An average cup of hot coffee boasts slightly more antioxidants and approximately the same amount of caffeine as its colder counterpart. Overall. studies have not revealed major differences in how the human body reacts to the two forms of java. Hot or cold. coffee seems to generally be good for you.2017 study by the University of Colorado2022 studiesThere is. however. one characteristic of a warm cup of joe that majorly differentiates it from a cold brew. and it doesn t have anything to do with consumption: the smell of hot coffee. According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. there is a connection between bean aroma and  potential antioxidant or stress relaxation activities. Using rats in a lab experiment. researchers found that a single whiff of hot coffee was enough to reduce tiredness and stress levels.  Since hot coffee has more vapors emanating from it. it is possible this effect may be heightened with hot coffee versus cold coffee.  Basit said. The cardiologist does. however. also make it a point to note that there is no definitive research on the topic and that a lot of the results might be connected to a placebo effect.Turns out. then. that the battle between hot vs. cold brew is one still worth arguing about. But if you want to make your own cold brew before summer s over. it s not that hard. Check out experts  favorite tools below.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

U.S. adults who haven t gotten any COVID-19 shots yet should consider a new option from Novavax ― a more traditional kind of vaccine. health officials said Tuesday.Regulators authorized the nation s first so-called protein vaccine If you have been waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine built on a different technology than those previously available. now is the time to join the millions of Americans who have been vaccinated.  Dr. Rochelle Walensky. CDC s director. said in a statement. endorsing an earlier decision from an influential advisory panel.Most Americans have gotten at least their primary COVID-19 vaccinations by now. but CDC officials said between 26 million and 37 million adults haven t had a single dose ― the population that Novavax. for now. will be targeting. We really need to focus on that population.  said CDC adviser Dr. Oliver Brooks. past president of the National Medical Association. Hopefully. the vaccine  will change them over from being unvaccinated to vaccinated. While it s unclear how many will be persuaded by a more conventional option.  I m really positive about this vaccine.  agreed fellow adviser Dr. Pablo Sanchez of Ohio State University.All of the vaccines used in the U.S. train the body to fight the coronavirus by recognizing its outer coating. the spike protein ― and the first three options essentially turn people s cells into a temporary vaccine factory. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines deliver genetic instructions for the body to make copies of the spike protein. The lesser-used Johnson & Johnson option uses a cold virus to deliver those instructions.In contrast. the Novavax vaccine injects copies of the spike protein that are grown in a lab and packaged into nanoparticles that to the immune system resemble a virus. Another difference: An ingredient called an adjuvant. that s made from the bark of a South American tree. is added to help rev up that immune response.Protein vaccines have been used for years to prevent other diseases including hepatitis B and shingles.Large studies in the U.S.. Mexico and Britain found two doses of the Novavax vaccine were safe and about 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. When the delta variant emerged last summer. Novavax reported a booster dose revved up virus-fighting antibodies that could tackle that mutant.Typical vaccine reactions were mild. including arm pain and fatigue. but regulators did warn about the possibility of a rare risk. heart inflammation. that also has been seen with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. mostly in teen boys or young men.But early on. manufacturing problems delayed the Novavax vaccine — meaning the shots were studied long before the omicron variant hit. so it s not clear how well they hold up against the immune-evading mutant.Still. Novavax points to lab testing that shows the first two shots do spur production of virus-fighting antibodies that are cross-protective against omicron. including the BA.5 subtype that s currently the nation s top threat. A booster dose further revved up cross-protective antibodies.The CDC s advisers unanimously endorsed the two-shot primary series. But several noted that it was important for regulators to clear a booster by the time. five or so months after their last dose. that Novavax recipients will need one.Also. the two doses typically are given three weeks apart. But CDC officials said that like with other COVID-19 vaccines. it s possible to wait up to eight weeks for the second dose — except for people at the highest risk. who need protection quickly.Walensky signed off on recommendations for adults to get the first two Novavax doses. In its first purchase. the U.S. government bought 3.2 million doses and vaccinations are expected to begin in the next few weeks.The Novavax vaccine also is used in Europe. Canada. Australia. South Korea and other countries. Many allow booster doses. and European regulators recently cleared the shots to given as young as age 12.The Maryland-based company likewise expects U.S. authorization of a booster dose and teen vaccinations to follow fairly soon.And like other vaccine makers. Novavax is testing shots updated to better match the newest omicron subtypes ― in anticipation of another round of boosters this fall and winter.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization said Tuesday that coronavirus cases have tripled across Europe in the past six weeks. accounting for nearly half of all infections globally. Hospitalization rates have also doubled. although intensive care admissions have remained low.In a statement on Tuesday. WHO s Europe director. Dr. Hans Kluge. described COVID-19 as  a nasty and potentially deadly illness  that people should not underestimate. He said super-infectious relatives of the omicron variant were driving new waves of disease across the continent and that repeat infections could potentially lead to long COVID.WHO said the 53 countries in its European region. which stretches to central Asia. reported nearly 3 million new coronavirus infections last week and that the virus was killing about 3.000 people every week. Globally. COVID-19 cases have increased for the past five weeks. even as countries have scaled back on testing. With rising cases. we re also seeing a rise in hospitalizations. which are only set to increase further in the autumn and winter months.  Kluge said.  This forecast presents a huge challenge to the health workforce in country after country. already under enormous pressure dealing with unrelenting crises since 2020. Earlier this week. editors of two British medical journals said the country s National Health Service has never before had so many parts of the system so close to collapsing.Kamran Abbasi. of the BMJ and Alastair McLellan of the Health Service Journal wrote in a joint editorial that the U.K. government was failing to address persistent problems worsened by COVID. including ambulances lining up outside hospitals too overloaded to accept new patients.They slammed the government s insistence that vaccines have broken the link between infections and hospitalizations. Although vaccines dramatically reduce the chances of severe disease and death. they have not made a significant dent on transmission. The government must stop gaslighting the public and be honest about the threat the pandemic still poses to them and the National Health Service.  the editors wrote.WHO released its fall strategy for COVID-19 on Tuesday. The U.N. health agency called for a second vaccine booster dose for anyone age 5 and up with weak immune systems. promoting mask-wearing indoors and on public transportation. and better ventilation in schools. offices and other places.Kluge said Southern Hemisphere countries were currently experiencing a very active flu season that. combined with COVID. was straining health systems. We are likely to see a similar scenario in the Northern Hemisphere.  Kluge said. warning that increased pressure could lead to business. travel and school chaos.He urged people to make their own decisions. even in countries where authorities have largely abandoned coronavirus restrictions. We re all aware of the tools we have to keep ourselves safe. assess our level of risk and take the necessary steps to protect others if we get infected.  Kluge said.  Just because a mask isn t mandated doesn t mean it s prohibited. ,Health News
abortion10-year-old rape victimBernard s attorneys filed a claim notice Tuesday. saying Attorney General Todd Rokita owes her damages for security costs. legal fees. reputational harm and emotional distress after saying last week he plans to investigate her actions and falsely suggesting she failed to report the abortion to state authorities. Mr. Rokita s false and misleading statements about alleged misconduct by Dr. Bernard in her profession constitute defamation per se. The statements have been and continue to be published by or on behalf of Mr. Rokita and the Office of the Attorney General.  Bernard s attorney Kathleen DeLaney said in the notice of claim.Fox News We re gathering the evidence as we speak. and we re going to fight this to the end. including looking at her licensure.  Rokita said.a storyconfirmed Given the current political atmosphere in the United States. Mr. Rokita s comments were intended to heighten public condemnation of Dr. Bernard. who legally provided legitimate medical care.  the claim notice stated.Kelly Stevenson. a spokesperson from Rokita s office. defended him in a statement to HuffPost on Tuesday. saying his work has  distinguished Indiana as a protector of unborn life and women.  This is part of a divisive narrative and an attempt to distract from the important work of the office. including the duty to determine whether practitioners have violated the standards of practice in his or her profession. as well as federal and state laws.  Stevenson said of the impending lawsuit.  We will defend against baseless claims. spoke outThe lawsuit targets Rokita as an individual. Bernard s lawyer explained. because the statements he made about Bernard  exceed the general scope of Mr. Rokita s authority as Indiana s Attorney General. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost also appeared on Fox News a few days before Rokita saying there was  not a whisper anywhere  of a 10-year-old being raped in Ohio. But two days later. several media reports confirmed a 27-year-old man was arrested and charged after police say he confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.,Health News

Rosemary Ojo Like anything with your body. your family history can play a role.ome people genetically just make more earwax.  said Dr. Maura Cosetti. the director of the Ear Institute at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai. So the reason you have more earwax than your friends can be a simple explanation: Every person functions differently depending on their genes. You may notice an increased amount of earwax as you age. particularly once you hit your older years. according to Cosetti. The outer part of the ear canal. where the earwax is made. gets softer with age. Frankly. it starts to sag.  she said.When the ear canal sags. it becomes more narrow. which causes earwax to get trapped in the ear canal. So it s not exactly that older people make more earwax ― they just may notice an increased amount because of a more narrow ear canal. Cosetti explained.If you suffer from chronic ear infections. you may notice that you have more earwax than those around you. according to Ojo. This is because people produce more earwax after certain kinds of ear infections (like swimmer s ear) to restore ear balance. she said.On the flip side. some people just have a lot of earwax and are prone to blockage. which can lead to frequent ear infections.Ojo said that those with  a lot of hair in the canal  or smaller ear canals can also be subject to a larger amount of earwax.may not make more [earwax] but there is just an easier chance that it would block up your ear canal.  which. in turn. would make it seem like you have more earwax than others.You probably associate skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis with hands. elbows and knees. but these skin conditions can occur in the ear canal. too ― and it s actually pretty common. Cosetti said.Because of these skin conditions.  you can end up having more earwax or earwax that doesn t come out in the right way.  she noted.At this point. it s hard to take a walk down the street without seeing people with earbuds in their ears (you may even have yours in right now). You likely wear your headphones while you work out. listen to podcasts or audiobooks. during video calls. and even as you clean the house. These devices are doing more than providing you with some background music during your day ― they could result in a larger amount of earwax in your ears. We re not exactly sure if in all people wearing earbuds causes [more] earwax. but if you re someone who s prone to making more earwax it s possible that ongoing use of earbuds could lead to that wax getting stuck.  Cosetti said.Historically. people with hearing aids often experience earwax blockages — now the same may be happening with earbuds. Cosetti suggested. People with too much wax have a risk of blockage.  Ojo said. adding that blocked ear canals can result in muffled hearing and can make you prone to ear infections. If you have an earwax blockage. Ojo noted that you may feel a sense of itchiness or fullness in the ear. You may also experience ringing in your ear or dizziness.call your doctor,Health News

probably lost its chanceGottlieb made the remarks on CBS   Face the Nation  Sunday. telling host Margaret Brennan that while monkeypox wasn t going to explode across the nation like the coronavirus. the U.S. should have been able to get it under control with more aggressive measures. Monkeypox. he said. has now become  firmly embedded in the community  and is likely to persist. I think. at this point. we ve failed to contain this.  he said.  We re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus. where this now becomes something that s persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. And. if it hasn t closed. it s certainly starting to close.  more than 1.800 confirmed casesGottlieb warned the U.S. has been making similar mistakes to contain the monkeypox outbreak as the country did at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. failing to test people early enough and not supplying enough vaccines to make it harder for the virus to spread. ordered about 7 million doses We re probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases. because … we had for a long time a very narrow case definition on who got tested. And. by and large. we re looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics.  Gottlieb said.  But it s a fact that there s cases outside that community right now.  We re not picking them up because we re not looking there.  he continued.  This has spread more broadly in the community. I wouldn t be surprised there s thousands of cases right now. very likely an undercount This is something we definitely need to take seriously.  Fauci said.

 You don t meet the diagnostic criteria for lupus. or anything.  the rheumatologist told me. her voice unwavering through the telehealth screen.  All of these blood tests point to a young. healthy woman. Her words set aflame something urgent within me. Something I had dulled over two months of needle pricks. copays and hourlong holds with various doctor s offices.healthyCall me healthy one more time*** thisStill. I thrived within the speed. I loved waking up before the sun and running miles on Prospect Park s wooded trails. I loved wandering through brownstone-lined streets. past coffee shops and food co-ops. and feeling Brooklyn s unique energy drifting through the air. I loved falling asleep with sore muscles. heavy eyes and the next day s to-do list on my nightstand. I never planned on slowing down.But one weekend at the end of March. I felt... slower. Something was off. The symptoms. though. felt barely distinguishable from early-spring allergies ― fatigue. sore throat. a light pressure headache. Nonetheless. I took a rapid COVID test. It was negative.In two days. the symptoms cleared. I sent in drafts. rode the train to Manhattan. ran hill repeats in Prospect Park. Then. my roommate tested positive for COVID. and my sore throat and headache returned. For most people. this is where their COVID journey begins and ends. They post an Instagram story displaying two lines on a rapid test. They isolate for 5-10 days. Someone brings them soup. They return to work and normal life. My journey. though. had just begun. I quarantined beside my roommate. both of us vaccinated and boosted. Throughout that week. I took daily PCR tests. but all of them came back negative.***One week later. I awoke from a dreamless sleep. I could not get out of bed. I could not reach for my phone. A migraine had settled behind my eyes. wrapping its limbs around my ears and head. like a baby koala.A week went by. Then another. A third. Each morning was the same. I swallowed Advil and Motrin. Sipped Pedialyte. Nibbled frozen bananas. Yogurt when I could stomach it. I stepped outside. and legs that had once run 30 miles in one day could barely walk two blocks. The sun shone. but I wished it would not. My vision blurred. My brain heaved. My head floated in some alternate universe. as if shrouded by an impenetrable screen. What word did I have for this feeling?  Brain fog  seems inadequate.  Dissociation.  still. insufficient for this all-consuming haze.feel itAfter three weeks passed. I woke up feeling slightly energized ― not like myself. but a version of myself. One that could roll out of bed near-instantaneously and walk around the apartment without feeling lightheaded. A self that craved. most of all. to run. So. I laced up my shoes and entered the state that had always felt natural to me. But it was not natural. Not this time. Now. my legs felt simultaneously leaded and weak. I shuffled along at a speed slower than any I had seen or felt before. After 20 minutes. I gave up.That afternoon. I sat at my desk and tried to work. but my heart began beating intensely ― palpitations that pulled at my mind and the words on the screen until I could barely comprehend them. All I knew was this beating.In the emergency room. a technician took my pulse and performed an EKG. A doctor called for a chest X-ray.  All normal.  she reported upon entering my hospital room.thank youAfterward I stumbled home. head dizzy. legs shaky. and a hospital bracelet clinking on my left wrist. Every block or so I d pause and crouch down on the sidewalk. There. among trash bags and shoe grime. I d close my eyes.***HealthyTo be entrenched in the medical system is to watch oneself fragment into simpler forms. I was a body ― flesh and blood. diffuse pain. every fleeting sensation and the thoughts that attended them. Now. I was a vial of blood. Many vials of blood. A plastic container of urine.  Which arm? Left or right?  Left.  OK with needles? OK with blood?  Nod. yes. Tourniquet on left arm. Wet sensation in the crook. Small prick.  Are you OK?  The technician s voice surprised me. I jerked my head to the left. Only then did I realize that I had been staring straight ahead. eyes unblinking. still. The technician was nothing but a mass moving around me. A blob of matter ― Barney-purple scrubs. blue sweatshirt.  Yes. fine.   Yes. OK.  Although. I meant: not fine. I meant: not OK. I meant: This is my fourth round of testing in four weeks. Why am I still being asked if needles scare me?healthy I am getting really concerned.  I messaged my doctor after two months.  Do you think this could be Lyme?  I could no longer feel my feet or my right arm. My neurologic symptoms had become so debilitating that. on the worst days. I felt as if I had a terrible flu. and that simultaneously. as if someone had slipped a tab of LSD under my tongue while I slept.I read accounts of individuals who were diagnosed with neurologic Lyme disease. despite negative tests.  I don t think you have Lyme.  my doctor wrote back. Desperate. I still booked an appointment with a Lyme specialist. He prescribed me a round of doxycycline and Malarone. for a potential co-occurring tick infection ― a diagnosis he considered  supported.  but not certain. After six weeks of treatment. I felt only worse.***As a young child. I favored bedtime stories where protagonists embarked on journeys. meeting new characters at every turn. In storybooks. this seems to be a trend: a pile-on effect. Alice follows the White Rabbit down a hole to meet the Mouse. the Caterpillar. the Cheshire Cat and the Queen. The baby bird leaves the nest in search of his mother. and finds various contenders: a rooster. a dog. a car. an airplane. Tucked beside my mother and sister at bedtime. I would delight in each character s dramatic portrayal. My mother s voice would change in timbre with each one ― the fast-speaking rabbit. the terse and angry caterpillar.Now. I imagined my medical practitioners as caricatures of themselves. too. The Lyme specialist wore thick glasses and mumbled his words. the EEG technician laughed boisterously. the sonogram technician spoke with gentle concern. waves of care crashing over me with every word. Perhaps it lessened the sting ― the cruelty of this mysterious illness ― to imagine doctors as illustrated characters. as if my journey with them were mere fantasy. mere storybook.Decades removed from bedtime stories. I rode the subway to one doctor s office and the Metro North train line to the next. I opened the telehealth window for a follow-up. I walked slowly to the Quest lab for testing. my legs weaker with each step. Normal. the characters told me. Healthy. when the lab tests returned. I had not felt so young and helpless since my storybook days. I had also never felt so old.***Three months into my illness. I went to stay with my parents in their home just north of Chicago. Here. I sought yet another opinion. this time from a doctor at Northwestern. He reviewed all my test results and conducted a thorough physical exam.  You fit the profile of my long-COVID patients very well.  he said.  Your symptoms. and the timeline. all point to post-COVID.  And yet. the kicker: I still had no test evidence. I had never gotten a positive PCR result. I had a high antibody count. but only from the spike protein. Was long COVID proven? No. But. was it likely I had another long-lasting illness? One that emerged at the same time I was exposed to COVID? Also. no.My diagnosis felt like a carnival raffle. a statistical game. Likely. unlikely. When the music stopped playing. my number was never called. So. I sought out others  stories. In early June. science journalist Melinda Wenner Moyer wrote that her daughter. son and husband all developed COVID symptoms at the same time. The family took COVID tests daily for seven days. but only her daughter tested positive. It s possible. Wenner Moyer writes. for a vaccinated person to catch COVID-19. but for their immune system to fend off the virus so well that a test cannot detect it. Since March. I felt buried by an unliftable blanket. heavier with every passing day. But now a corner had unfolded. There I was: ever so slightly ― seen. Now. I set Google alerts for  long COVID  and  long COVID treatment.  I joined the Body Politic support group. a patient-led organization breaking down barriers to post-COVID care. I followed Instagram pages and Twitter hashtags. I reactivated my Facebook account and joined additional long-COVID groups. There. I d lurk in the comments section. taking screenshots of any stories that resembled mine. I found anecdotal evidence: Other patients had been exposed to the virus and never tested posted. but developed long-COVID symptoms. nonetheless. Suddenly. I was not just some lone storybook character in a fantasy world.***My guess is that there are countless individuals who have long COVID. but who lack the evidence necessary to access care. Still. I must be clear: this is not their story. This is my story. and the facts of my story are this: I am a 26-year-old white woman. I have a flexible job. I have good health insurance. I have friends who check in constantly. I have family that is willing and able to help pay for my medical costs ― I could not have afforded this care without them. I saw six doctors. underwent hundreds of tests. and paid thousands of dollars out-of-network before receiving a post-COVID diagnosis. Still. without a positive COVID test. I don t fit the criteria for most medical trials or long-COVID programs. So. compiling a team of trusted practitioners requires incessant research. back-and-forth calls with doctor s offices. my student health center and my insurance company. and hours on hold. Most people do not have the resources to take these steps.Importantly. women and nonbinary people face higher instances of medical gaslighting and delayed diagnosis than men do. This is especially true for low-income. trans. Black and Hispanic women. as well as nonbinary folks. These are the same groups that. most often. lack the resources to pay for and seek adequate treatment. If mine is just one story. I wonder. what facts do the other stories hold? What words of dismissal have been uttered by doctors? What jobs have been lost? How many mental health conditions have emerged? What unsafe. exploratory treatments have people turned to when unable to access adequate care? My guess is that many people s stories bear a resemblance to mine ― and yet their paths hold deeper divots and more treacherous peaks.Further. my story should not be interpreted as a critique of any one doctor or medical practice. I am grateful for the many doctors who worked with me. I am indebted to modern-day medicine. But I am curious about the limits of the medical system when it comes to invisible illness ― what it means to look like a  young. healthy woman.  but to feel quite ill.***Currently. no days are good days. Many mornings. I awake with a migraine. the right side of my body falls numb. and I walk sluggishly. around the block. in an overwhelming fog. On these days. I cannot shake the thought that something alien lingers inside me. This virus is new and its mechanisms are unclear. But it is sly. it wears a heavy armor. It yields a piercing sword. In my darkest hours. I call my sister in tears. I say.  There s something alien inside my brain.  I say.  There s something deeply wrong with me.and no one will help!  When I awake ― brain throbbing. exhausted but unable to achieve restful sleep ― I will scribble feverishly in a notebook. I will search for the words to convey this. I will not find the words to convey this. Again and again. I will fail.There are periods when I feel slightly improved ― for one day. three days. maybe four. I know better than to interpret these days as anything more than what they are. They are not prophecies. I do not know whether this better will linger. or if bad will take its place. I have begun to relent to the details of a calmer life. The slow breakfast. The hour when the sun is just low enough in the morning that I might sit outside and read. I take my time to stand. to feel the cool floor tiles under my bare feet. To let the dizziness subside. I measure. Tablespoons of coffee grounds. Hours spent awake. Mornings passed without a migraine. Blocks trudged with heavy legs. It is not willingly that l relent to this slower life. It is with necessity. Knowing that it s only through the slowing that I may. one day. exit this tunnel. Only through the slowing that I may. one day. return to the speed that pulls me relentlessly on the other side.Emma Zimmerman is a writer and freelance journalist.

President Joe Biden has dropped plans to nominate a Kentucky anti-abortion attorney to a lifetime federal judgeship. a White House spokesperson said Friday.Biden had come under intense criticism from Democrats and reproductive rights groups after the Louisville Courier-Journal broke the news that he planned to pick Chad Meredith for a seat on the U.S. District Court in eastern Kentucky. Meredith s potential nomination appeared to be part of a broader deal on a mix of judicial nominees being worked out behind the scenes between the White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).In the end. though. it was a Republican ― Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky ― who appeared to tank the potential nomination. In considering potential District Court nominees. the White House learned that Senator Rand Paul will not return a blue slip on Chad Meredith.  White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement.  Therefore. the White House will not nominate Mr. Meredith. It is a tradition in the Senate Judiciary Committee that its chair will not advance a judicial nominee until both senators from that nominee s home state turn in a so-called blue slip ― literally. a blue piece of paper ― signaling that they are on board with moving forward. Because Paul said he would not turn in a blue slip for Meredith. he effectively killed the nomination.A Paul spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why he opposed Meredith s potential nomination.RepublicansDonald TrumpDemocrats,Health News

If you re under the age of 40. a new study suggests you might want to stop drinking. Altogether.Global Burden of DiseasesDrinking more than the equivalent of a beer a day could increase the chances of health risk for men in particular. the study found. Men under 40 should not exceed a level of 0.136 drinks a day. while women in the same age range should not exceed 0.273 – around a quarter of a standard drink a day. researchers said. Our message is simple.  said senior author Emmanuela Gakidou. a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington s School of Medicine.  Young people should not drink. but older people may benefit from drinking small amounts. Older adults without any underlying health conditions could see some benefits from drinking alcohol. the study found. such as limiting risk of stroke. diabetes and ischemic heart disease.For those aged 40-64. half a standard drink to almost two standard drinks a day was considered a safe consumption level. For anyone aged 65 or older. health risks increased after drinking a little more than three standard drinks a day.But the authors still recommended that alcohol intake for older adults should not exceed 1.87 standard drinks a day. After that level. health risks increased with each drink. the report found.The rolling Global Burden of Diseases study is the first to report alcohol risks by geographical region. age. sex and year. The team recommended that alcohol consumption guidelines should also be based on age and location. with the strictest guidelines for men aged 15-39. who are at the greatest risk of harmful alcohol consumption worldwide.told the IndependentGakidou added:  While it may not be realistic to think young adults will abstain from drinking. we do think it s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.

When I asked about getting an IUD. a T-shaped intrauterine device inserted through the cervix to prevent pregnancy. during a visit to my doctor in 2004. she responded by laughing and telling me that there was no way they d be able to get one through my cervix until after I had given birth. I was 20 at the time and giving birth was what I was actively trying to avoid.Although IUDs are now placed whether or not you ve pre-stretched your cervix. I m glad she declined to do so. I ve since learned that most of the time the procedure. as well as many other gynecological procedures. are done without pain management. medical professionals and medical schoolsIn 2013. after trying several types of contraception that all had varying unpleasant side effects. I learned that IUDs were now approved for people who had not yet given birth and I made an appointment to have one inserted. I thought it was weird that there was a doctor and two nurses present for a procedure that had been described to me as  a little bit of pressure. followed by a pinch. and then maybe a few days of cramping. The doctor told me he needed to move my cervix into place. and I felt a sudden. sharp pain. I reacted appropriately. and luckily for me. so did the doctor. He gave me a numbing injection and the rest of the procedure was completely mundane. Afterward. my periods stopped. my emotions were much more predictable. and I became a zealous IUD advocate who recommended IUDs to all of my menstruating friends.I remained blissfully unaware of what many people experience when they get an IUD inserted until one of my friends took my advice and had one placed herself.I was at work when I got her phone call. She was sobbing in the parking lot of her doctor s office just minutes after her procedure. She told me she couldn t move and that the pain was so bad she might vomit. She was crying hysterically. I was beyond confused. This nightmare she was experiencing because her pain had not been managed was nothing like what I had experienced. She went back into her doctor s office and asked for help.Here are some of our texts from that day: Luckily. her pain eventually subsided to a slightly tolerable level and she was finally able to to drive home (cursing me as she did so. I m sure).These days. thanks to TikTok. people considering an IUD are able to learn more about the procedure. including what actually takes place and the tools used. Which brings us to the tenaculum. a pointy. metallic (medieval torture?) device that has often been left out of patient counseling conversations. and therefore is mostly unknown to the average person. but which has now become a breakout star on the video-sharing site. The tool. essentially a long pair of tweezers with stabby ends bent in toward each other. is used to center and hold the cervix in place for several different gynecological procedures. Its sharp points are placed on either side of the cervix. piercing it. and then a doctor moves it into position (with the cervix moving with it. of course). Why the tenaculum is ever used without anesthetic. much less without an explanation of its use to the patient beforehand. is baffling to me. And even if you do your own research on online medical sites. you get information like this: Expect your doctor to take the following steps to insert your IUD:A speculum will be inserted into the vagina to hold it open for the procedure. Step three is when the tenaculum is used and after seeing videos of the procedure. I think it s safe to say that the description does not sufficiently explain what is actually happening. Injecting lidocaine as a local anesthetic can reduce the discomfort. but this isn t a routine part of most IUD placements. Instead. doctors often opt for something referred to as  verbocaine.  which. in other words. is talking to the patient throughout the procedure to distract them from their pain. Can you believe that?use actual pain management medicationsSo why not for gynecological procedures? One popular TikTok OB-GYN claimed.  you don t get anesthetic for a piercing. :: insert eyeroll and sarcastic shrug emoji here ::That doctor has since deleted that video due to the uproar it received. but it should give you some insight into how many doctors understand (or. more aptly. don t understand) what people are going through during these procedures. Four years ago. when it was almost time to get my IUD replaced. I asked my new doctor if he used anesthesia during placement. No. the pain that you feel from IUD insertion is from uterine cramping. and a cervical injection will do nothing for that pain.  he told me. He finally agreed to use anesthesia after I told him I wouldn t have the procedure any other way. but I didn t feel comfortable negotiating my health care. so I decided to find a new gynecologist to insert my IUD when I was ready.It didn t go as planned.Dr. Kristin Markell doing a praying hands camera bowShe didn t try to convince me that the pain wouldn t be  that bad  or that my concerns weren t valid. She was completely on my side from the moment I expressed my anxiety. I wish I could clone and distribute her throughout the world. because the world needs a lot more doctors like her right now. Alas. the best I can do is give you the reassurance that there are other doctors out there who will listen to you and want you to be involved in your own health care decisions.On the morning of the procedure. I wasn t nervous. I picked out a cute dress and made a  get ready with me (GRWM)  video. My husband came to the office with me to hold my hand and I filmed my reaction to the procedure with my other hand. Here is how it went:this new worldare already scheming to outlaw themBut we should have control over our bodies and if and when we want to get pregnant. And we shouldn t have anything standing in our way of accessing reproductive health care ― especially not the fear of being tortured by unnecessarily agonizing procedures.studies have foundanything from this piece I want it to be this:You should be the one deciding what happens to and in your body. and you should have access to health care that is as positive and pain-free as possible.

earwax is actually a good thinga sign of a healthy ear.  according to Maura Cosetti. the director of the ear institute of New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.But what if you notice a change in your earwax color? Or you feel like your ear is clogged? Just because earwax is a necessary (and healthy) thing to have doesn t mean certain earwax problems or changes can t signify that something is wrong.Here. experts share when your earwax may indicate a problem. Jason A. Brant  For the vast majority of people. earwax does not cause any problems at all and there is no need to remove it.  Brant said. All in all. earwax doesn t mean your ears are dirty. In fact. it s a vital part of how the ear canals function.  [Ear]wax has lots of great properties. It has a lubricant. and we think it has antimicrobial and even micro-fungal properties.  she said.  The earwax helps with overall ear health in general.  Cosetti said.Over time. your earwax may change. and that s OK. Healthy earwax looks different from person to person: It isn t a one-size-fits-all thing. Normal earwax can range in color from light tan to dark brown to even almost black.  Brant said. adding that the consistency of earwax differs. too. It can be flaky. firm. soft or mushy.  Subtle changes in the color or consistency of the wax usually do not indicate [a] serious problem.  Brant said.According to Brant. at-home earwax removal tools like ear candles can push earwax deeper into your ear. which could in itself cause problems that require a visit to the doctor.method that s suggested by experts Earwax [is] only a problem if it becomes impacted or stuck in the ear canal.  Brant said.  This can cause discomfort. hearing loss and lead to infections.  When earwax is stuck in your ear canal. it has nowhere to go while your ear continues to make new earwax. according to Cosetti. This causes the earwax to fill up the canal until you develop unwanted. painful symptoms. she said.It is cause for concern if your earwax starts to look like pus or turns into a yellow or green liquid. which could be signs of an ear infection. Brant noted.Also (and you likely already know this).  any blood in the ear canal or earwax needs to be looked at.  he said.If you experience ear pain or discomfort. it s time to make an appointment with your doctor. Brant stressed. And this is the case whether or not the ear pain is associated with a change in earwax.hint Normal earwax shouldn t feel [like] it s blocking your ear.  she explained.A blocked feeling could be the sign of a problem like sudden nerve-related hearing loss. according to Cosetti. which some folks misdiagnose in themselves. thinking it is just an earwax buildup.  Many people with sudden hearing loss don t report that they [lost] their hearing. they usually report that their ear is clogged.  she said.If you experience this feeling. reach out to your doctor ASAP.,Health News
GENEVA (AP) — About 25 million children worldwide have missed out on routine immunizations against common diseases like diptheria. largely because the coronavirus pandemic disrupted regular health services or triggered misinformation about vaccines. according to the U.N.In a new report published Friday. the World Health Organization and UNICEF said their figures show 25 million children last year failed to get vaccinated against diptheria. tetanus and pertussis. a marker for childhood immunization coverage. continuing a downward trend that began in 2019. This is a red alert for child health.  said Catherine Russell. UNICEF s Executive Director. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation.  she said. adding that the consequences would be measured in lives lost.Data showed the vast majority of the children who failed to get immunized were living in developing countries. namely Ethiopia. India. Indonesia. Nigeria and the Philippines. While vaccine coverage fell in every world region. the worst effects were seen in East Asia and the Pacific.Experts said this  historic backsliding  in vaccination coverage was especially disturbing since it was occurring as rates of severe malnutrition were rising. Malnourished children typically have weaker immune systems and infections like measles can often prove fatal to them. The convergence of a hunger crisis with a growing immunization gap threatens to create the conditions for a child survival crisis.  the U.N. said.Scientists said low vaccine coverage rates had already resulted in preventable outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio. In March 2020. WHO and partners asked countries to suspend their polio eradication efforts amid the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic. There have since been dozens of polio epidemics in more than 30 countries. This is particularly tragic as tremendous progress was made in the two decades before the COVID pandemic to improve childhood vaccination rates globally.  said Helen Bedford. a professor of children s health at University College London. who was not connected to the U.N. report. She said the news was shocking but not surprising. noting that immunization services are frequently an  early casualty  of major social or economic disasters.Dr. David Elliman. a consultant pediatrician at Britain s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. said it was critical to reverse the declining vaccination trend among children. The effects of what happens in one part of the world can ripple out to affect the whole globe.  he said in a statement. noting the rapid spread of COVID-19 and more recently. monkeypox.  Whether we act on the basis of ethics or ‘enlightened self interest.  we must put (children) top of our list of priorities.  ,Health News

Joe BidenabortionsguidanceSince the fall of Roe v. Wade last month. a number of states have enacted abortion bans. some of which include exceptions for the life and safety of the mother. However. the language in those clauses is often vague and confusing. which creates an incentive for providers not to perform abortions until a patient is moments from death. for fear of losing their license or facing legal repercussions.The Biden administration s memo is an attempt to address that. but Texas officials have interpreted it as an effort to  use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic  and to force providers into performing abortions. the lawsuit says. This administration has a hard time following the law. and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said in a statement Thursday.  I will ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court s important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration s unlawful agenda. The White House called it  unthinkable  that a state would try and fight this guidance. This is yet another example of an extreme and radical Republican elected official.

In a truly bizarre exchange during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday. the leader of a national anti-abortion organization claimed that it  would not be an abortion  if a 10-year-old rape victim got pregnant and … had an abortion.Catherine Glenn Foster. the president and CEO of Americans United for Life. was responding to questions from Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) about whether she thinks a 10-year-old girl would or should  choose  to have a baby. After some back and forth. during which Foster refused to answer the question. she came up with a response. I believe it would probably impact her life. and so. therefore. it would fall under any exception and would not be an abortion.  said Foster. Wait.  replied Swalwell. puzzled.  It would not be an abortion if a 10-year-old with her parents made the decision not to have a baby that was the result of a rape?  If a 10-year-old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life. then that s not an abortion.  Foster said.  So it would not fall under any abortion restriction in our nation. Here s a video clip of their exchange:The Americans United for Life president appeared to be trying to redefine abortion to avoid saying that. yes. of course. a 10-year-old rape victim should be allowed to have an abortion.It s not even a hypothetical scenario: Earlier this month. a 10-year-old girl who had been raped at least twice was forced to travel from Ohio to Indiana to get an abortion. She and her family had to go to another state for the medical procedure because. in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Ohio imposed a ban on all abortions after six weeks. The 10-year-old was reportedly six weeks and three days pregnant.After Foster made her bonkers claim. Swalwell turned to another committee witness. Sarah Warbelow. legal director for the Human Rights Campaign. Ms. Warbelow. are you familiar with disinformation?  he asked. Uh. yes I am.  said Warbelow. Did you just hear some disinformation?  asked Swalwell. Yes. I heard some very significant disinformation.  Warbelow replied. offering an actual definition of what an abortion is. An abortion is a procedure. it s a medical procedure. that individuals undergo for a wide range of circumstances. including because they have been sexually assaulted. raped in the case of the 10-year-old.  she said.  It doesn t matter whether or not there is a statutory exemption. It is still a medical procedure that is understood to be an abortion. In the case of the 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio. Warbelow added that there is no exception in Ohio state law that allows abortions when the life or the health of the pregnant person is at risk. That s why that 10-year-old had to cross state lines in order to receive an abortion.  she said.called out Foster on Twitter MAGA GOP doesn t want you to know their abortion laws force pregnancies on little girls.  he said.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City. one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive.City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a  stable appointment infrastructure  as the vaccine supply increases.growing outbreakVaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox. but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection. regardless of their sexual orientation. After COVID. this should have been easy.  said Daniel Ross. 25. a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday.  I kept refreshing and refreshing. ... I was frustrated. Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal. which went down minutes after it went live. It s going to haunt me.  he said.  Me being a gay man who lives in Harlem. there s a lot of anxiety. I had four mosquito bites. and I was thinking what if this isn t a mosquito bite? To date. New York City has administered nearly 7.000 vaccinations. while thousands more have been waiting for their chance to get inoculated against the virus. Health officials said they were expecting 14.500 doses this week.As of Wednesday. 336 people in New York City have tested positive for orthopoxvirus. a category of disease that includes smallpox. That s a fourth more than the day before. according to city data. Officials said they were fairly certain that all of the new cases are likely monkeypox and that many more cases remain undiagnosed.Learning from its experience with the rollout of COVID vaccines. Washington. D.C.. is allowing residents to preregister for vaccination appointments. As many as 3.000 slots were to open sometime Thursday. officials said.As news of the outbreak spread. Jeff Waters asked his doctor to be vaccinated before the Baltimore man left for a trip to Europe. where cases have been rising.  They said ‘Sorry. we just don t have them here.   Waters recalled.Weeks later. the first signs of a monkeypox hit him while at dinner with a friend. He developed terrible headaches. a 102-degree (38.9-degree Celsius) fever. and intense chills. I feel grateful. I had a mild case.  Waters said.New York City is giving priority for the vaccine to men who have had anonymous sex with other men or who have had multiple partners over the past two weeks.Symptoms include rashes or sores that resemble pimples or blisters. They can sometimes be painful but usually not fatal. Most people don t require hospitalization and recover within two to four weeks.Infections spread by direct contact with rashes. scabs or body fluids. according the CDC. It can spread through kissing. sex and body contact. In some cases. prolonged face-to-face exposure. as well as unwashed laundry contaminated by the virus. could lead to infection.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that commercial laboratories have been developing ways to test for the virus. The CDC said the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis beginning this week would be accepting samples from across the country to boost the country s testing capability. This will not only increase testing capacity but also make it more convenient for providers and patients to access tests by using existing provider-to-laboratory networks.  CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement earlier this week.fresh worries over stigmatizing LGBTQJay Jurden. a New York City comic. expressed concern about his inability to secure a vaccine. particularly because of the ramifications in a city with tens of thousands of gay men.

I m not even saying that everyone should be able to go get it tomorrow. just that the website should work. ___Associated Press Medical Writer Mike Stobbe contributed to this report.,Health News
For the past decade. a deadly brain disease periodically pops up in Texas deer populations. Chronic wasting disease. also called CWD. distorts brain proteins called prions. causing fatal degeneration of the brain. The same disease is called  mad cow  when it strikes cattle.  scrapie  in sheep. and  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  in humans. Three-quarters of the cases are in captive deer. which are usually being bred for hunting. Most wildlife officials view CWD as the single greatest threat to wild cervids like deer. elk and moose — and when captive deer test positive for CWD. the state response is swift. brutal and total.Texas Parks and Wildlife normally orders that not only the infected deer be killed. but also every other deer at the site. The breeder is then required to disinfect the deer pens by removing the soil and burying it six feet deep. incinerating it. or having it chemically digested. according to court records. The site can t hold deer for five years after depopulation. But in an unusual case that highlights the growing tensions between wildlife officials and breeders who farm deer for customers willing to pay upward of $10.000 to hunt on high-fenced ranches. a rancher outside Dallas is refusing to exterminate his herd. despite several deer testing positive for the disease. Robert Williams. the 83-year-old owner of RW Trophy Ranch. has scored a series of legal wins that are testing the limits of the state s control over its deer herds. No other CWD-contaminated facility in the state has managed to delay euthanizing its herd this long. according to Mitch Lockwood. the director of the big game program at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Williams found three dead does in a pen in February 2021 and sent tissue samples for routine CWD tests. One came back positive. The size and color of the red stain on the sample s slide indicated the deer had carried diseased prions for more than a year. Lockwood said. Williams didn t believe the result when it came back positive. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department exhumed the deer s corpse to confirm the test with a DNA sample. In the 16 months since. another eight deer on Williams  property have tested positive for CWD. The CWD-positive deer were housed in four separate pens.  We consider the whole facility to be contaminated.  Lockwood said. Williams has flatly refused to let the state euthanize the deer. saying the mass culling would cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars and torpedo a business he has run for decades. He also objected to the state s plans to kill the deer at night using suppressed rifles. saying imprecise head and neck shots would prolong their suffering.  It would be a slaughter.  Williams told HuffPost.  I said there s no way I d agree to that. That looks like Nazi Germany s deer herd plan. It s not clear how CWD found its way onto RW Trophy Ranch. But the outbreak there started after captive deer started testing positive at five other breeding sites across the state. leaving wildlife officials scrambling to contain the disease. Because deer breeders buy and sell animals across the state and eventually release many of them onto game ranches. the sudden uptick raised fears among wildlife biologists that captive deer could further spread the disease among wild deer.  If the disease was released. there are other deer being exposed to it right now.  Lockwood said.State game agencies have so far failed to remove the disease once it takes root in a wild population.RW Trophy Ranch transferred 559 deer to 64 different facilities. including 24 release sites. in the five years leading up to its first positive case. according to the state veterinarian affidavit. mad cow disease has jumped the species barriershould not eat CWD-infected venisonWildlife is generally classified as a public resource managed at the state level. The only time a wild deer becomes private property is when a hunter kills one and affixes a state-issued tag to its carcass. Texas. however. is one of about a dozen states to allow private citizens to farm captive deer. though it still legally classifies them as wildlife. That system has created a $1.6 billion business in which breeders use artificial insemination. genetic selection and supplemental feed to create bucks with antlers far bigger than those occurring in the wild. which makes them more attractive to paying hunters. Enclosed game ranches typically charge hunters based on the antler score of the deer they shoot. Conservation groups widely oppose classifying captive animals as wildlife and enclosing them behind tall fences. viewing it as the effective privatization of deer. And since CWD entered the state of Texas. breeders have increasingly butted heads against state officials. CWD has only been found in a few small pockets of free-ranging deer in Texas. Officials first detected the disease among wild mule deer in West Texas back in 2012. They were likely infected by deer in neighboring New Mexico. Deer have also tested positive in the Texas Panhandle.Captive deer. however. account for more than three-quarters of confirmed CWD cases in Texas. state data show. Several breeder deer tested positive in Medina County. west of San Antonio. in 2015. Two years later. CWD started appearing in wild deer there. too. Since last year s outbreak on breeding sites. 132 deer have tested positive for the disease. either at breeding sites or after release to a game ranch. along with one elk and one red deer. Red deer are an exotic import to Texas. Though elk are native to the state. the Texas legislature reclassified them as an exotic species in 1997. allowing game ranches to sell hunts for captive elk year-round. The state has so far depopulated deer at three of the five other breeder properties with CWD. A fourth breeder killed all his deer himself. The fifth facility killed and tested most of its captive deer. but reached an agreement with Texas Parks and Wildlife to keep raising captive deer. provided it participates in a research program testing whether animals can build genetic resistance to the disease. The state offered Williams a similar research plan. but he refused the conditions.Williams asked a judge in Travis County. which includes the state capital. Austin. for a temporary restraining order in January to block the state from entering his property to kill deer. The request was denied. so Williams  lawyer went to a second judge. this time in the ranch s home county of Kaufman. That judge granted a temporary restraining order. The case remains in legal limbo.. In the meantime. RW Trophy Ranch cannot legally move its deer or release them for hunting.  The deer belong to the people of the state of Texas — that s been litigated in the past.  Texas Parks and Wildlife Department lawyer Todd George said.  We ve always been successful. Williams. for his part. hopes to win in the court of public opinion.  Now that I got fawns born. I want to have children holding those innocent fawns and say. ‘That s what those sons-of-a-guns want to kill.   Williams said. Williams dismissed wildlife officials  concerns that CWD could decimate wild herds. calling it a  political disease.  He claimed other more common diseases pose more of a threat. and that CWD shouldn t prevent him from releasing his deer. Williams said he d been following a ranch manager in Michigan who releases CWD-positive deer and who is experimenting with a diet that he believes could reverse CWD. (That ranch manager did not return HuffPost s phone calls.)  They let them out. they shoot them.  Williams said.  By the time the test comes back. they ate the deer up. It hasn t hurt anybody. Ranchers can test deer for CWD with a rectal biopsy before releasing them for hunting. However. Lockwood said those tests are less reliable than post-mortem ones.Wildlife biologists generally agree that CWD is incurable. but some cervid experts share Williams  skepticism about CWD. Deer populations have exploded since the disease first appeared in Colorado mule deer in 1967. said Dr. Mark Westhusin. a professor at Texas A&M University. He also stressed that there s no conclusive evidence that the disease can jump from deer to humans.  There s just not enough scientifically controlled experiments that prove or suggest in any manner in my mind that CWD is some crazy terrible disease that s going to wipe out whole populations of deer.  Westhusin said.  Leave him alone. Let him have his deer. Skeptical hunters often raise similar points. according to Kip Adams. chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association. But CWD incubates slowly. and it generally takes years for animals to show symptoms. Adams said. Rather than causing deer to drop dead in droves. the prion disease slowly erodes infected deer s coordination and mental sharpness. That. in turn. makes it harder for them to evade predators and drives up their mortality rate from natural causes.  They become an easy lunch for a coyote or a predator or a hunter.  Adams said.  It doesn t mean it s any less dangerous to the deer herd.  Adams backed Texas officials  plan to cull CWD-exposed herds like the one bred by Williams. saying that virtually all U.S. wildlife biologists studying the issue consider the disease a serious threat. Live testing is unreliable and any release of captive deer risks infecting more wild ones.  The CWD skeptics in almost every case are people on the captive side.  Adams said.  They don t want to believe in it because they have a business that depends on captive deer. ,Health News
Even though irritable bowel syndrome affects between 25 and 45 million people in the United States (and approximately 5% to 10% of people worldwide). it s still not taken totally seriously. To someone who doesn t have it. IBS may seem like no big deal — like a run-of-the-mill stomachache.But for people with IBS. a condition that may present with symptoms of chronic abdominal pain. bloating. diarrhea. constipation or some combination of these. it can quickly become what your entire life revolves around. People with IBS are often physically and emotionally exhausted by their symptoms and by repeated efforts to get answers and treatments that could help.  Dr. Lauren Tormey. a gastroenterologist at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon. New Hampshire. told HuffPost.  Not only can it be challenging to make a diagnosis of IBS. but symptoms can change over time. causing confusion and frustration for both patients and doctors. This can lead to an all-consuming cycle of avoiding trigger foods. social gatherings that involve food and drinks (so. all of them) and any situations that entail not knowing where the nearest bathroom is — along with the following things only people with IBS would understand: I wish I could say having IBS is always in the back of my mind. but truthfully. it s front and center — all day. every day.  Lauren Schneider. senior PR and communications manager at Compt. told HuffPost.  The only time I m not worried about it is if I know for a fact I won t be leaving home that day. When we re stressed about our gut health and anticipate a flare-up or a worsening of symptoms. it sends signals from our brain to our gut. which can actually affect our digestive system. The result? Tightened abdominal muscles. colon spasms and an uptick in discomfort. The stress associated with the fear of experiencing IBS symptoms can even result in an inability for the body to properly digest food.  Dr. Vanessa Méndez. a board-certified gastroenterologist and founder of Planted Forward. told HuffPost.  This can lead to bloating and diarrhea or even a slowing down of the digestive system that triggers constipation. With IBS. because of the hyper-responsiveness of the enteric nervous system (the part of the nervous system located in our digestive tract). symptoms can often be unpredictable. This means turning down the chance to try a new menu item at a restaurant. or cocktails at happy hour. so as to not risk an attack of symptoms.For people who have never dealt with IBS. these boundaries might seem like overkill. But they can mean the difference between enjoying time spent with others. or being so focused on masking your symptoms you miss out on the experience (or spend the bulk of the experience in the bathroom). That one scoop of ice cream is enough to make me feel like I ve had food poisoning.  Abi Cowell. a vegan food blogger. told HuffPost.  Will it kill me like a food allergy would? No. But it will cause an awful lot of pain and misery.  Having IBS and socializing is filled with emotional landmines. especially when meals are involved.  Lindsay Barnes. media relations manager at Evoke Kyne. told HuffPost.There s the frustration of people not understanding that needing to go to the bathroom means you need to go now. The fear of entering the dating world and having to explain why you go so much. The awkwardness when you re having a good time and suddenly need to make a run to the loo. When you just want to sit down and have a normal meal. whether by yourself or with family and friends. these things can be emotionally exhausting.  Tormey said.  The pain experienced by individuals with IBS is in part due to visceral hypersensitivity. Visceral hypersensitivity is pain or discomfort coming from internal organs (like those in the abdomen). under circumstances that wouldn t normally be painful (like eating or during a bowel movement). The nervous system experiences these sensations and communicates them to the brain for processing via the gut-brain connection. Food ― eating it. even thinking about it ― regardless of the food type. [it] stimulates normal digestive function and can therefore result in pain in IBS.  Tormey said.  Sometimes eating is accompanied by the immediate urge to have a bowel movement because of a heightened stomach-colon reflex. Putting food or fluid in the stomach sends a signal via the nervous system to the colon. The colon understands this as a stimulus to empty whatever waste is there — and doesn t care if you re mid-sentence on a first date.The average person can control the effects of what they put into their body. and can adapt to food-centric situations. because their sensitivities to certain foods remain relatively consistent and clear-cut. I don t have that luxury.  Barnes said.  I have absolutely no control over my body anymore — I can be as mindful as possible and work really hard on my diet. but at the end of the day. my gut controls my body now. and not in a good way. Food intolerances are common in IBS. and dietary modifications can help manage symptoms for some people. But for others.  visceral hypersensitivity and abnormal gut-brain communication can cause flare-ups to happen anyway. despite watching what you eat.  Tormey said. And who knows how long the flareup will last?  Barnes said.  A half hour? Two hours? The rest of the day? When Schneider leaves her home. she s always planning — always conscientious of where she can find a restroom if she needs to stop.  If I m going to be driving somewhere without quick access to a bathroom. I won t eat before my trip.  she said.  I ll wait until I get there. These coping strategies are actually pretty common. and can be a normal response to a situation that s outside of our comfort zone. even for people who don t suffer from IBS. When anxiety levels are high in a situation such as traveling. your digestive processes can get dysregulated.  Méndez said.  During stress. the brain sends signals to the gut that influences motility and digestion. which can lead to diarrhea or constipation. Because the gut is constantly at work. the brain typically filters out the nerve signals it sends (paying attention and responding to some in order to regulate gut activity. while not focusing on others). Normal gut-brain communication can go wrong when something disturbs the nervous system or the brain for a long period of time — like when traveling. working a stressful job or rushing to get errands done. In these circumstances. the brain perceives stronger signals from the gut. and even the mildest stomach cramp can immediately trigger the brain to start worrying about the potential for worsening pain or a bowel movement coming on.  Tormey said.  The brain subsequently sends inappropriate signals back that disrupt gut function and can worsen symptoms. As a result. you might find yourself doing the same as Schneider: scouting bathrooms on your route or delaying meals. Something I want others to understand about how IBS impacts my life is the daily secrecy and diversions that surround my use of the bathroom.  Amanda Dexter. 36. told HuffPost.  There s a lot of sneaking (multiple) trips to the bathroom or making excuses as to why it took you so long. Eating food and having bowel movements are essential to our survival — and across cultures. food is social and often enjoyed and shared with others. But unless you re potty training a toddler. bowel movements aren t exactly a typical subject of dinner-table conversation. These aspects of daily life pose regular challenges for those with IBS.  Tormey said. and can lead to a loss of enjoyment around food. a fear of eating and even disordered eating habits. such as skipping meals to avoid needing to use the bathroom.If more people were to open up about their own horror stories. Dexter believes it would help alleviate the unnecessary embarrassment that many people with IBS feel.  Commiseration can go a long way into helping IBS sufferers not feel so alone.  she said.IBS is a disorder of  dysmotility.  meaning that movement of food. fluid and waste through the gut is altered. This leads to irregular bowel habits (diarrhea. constipation or both).  Tormey said.  You might spend a lot of time in the bathroom. either having bowel movements. trying to have a bowel movement or dealing with pain around the time of bowel movements. It s not uncommon for people with IBS to miss days of work or school because of these exhausting. intrusive symptoms ― only to be further stressed out over the resulting lost productivity and wages. There have been times where I feel so emotionally drained and frustrated that I ll just cry in the bathroom.  Barnes said.For Schneider. being able to work from home has alleviated much of the anxiety associated with her condition. She s able to eat more intuitively and with a bathroom always nearby. Work trips are a little difficult. especially when the whole group goes out to dinner.  Schneider said.  That s when I just resort to my old ways. and either barely eat or only eat my tried-and-true few things that won t upset my stomach. Because IBS symptoms can be intermittent and unpredictable. varying in both nature and severity. the condition can leave you with a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety about what might happen outside the home. To compound matters. there s a well-established recognition that the central nervous system. or brain. also has a significant role in regulating not only gastrointestinal motility. but sensation — from both an unconscious and a higher emotional level.  Dr. Brooks Cash. professor of gastroenterology at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School and Memorial Hermann. told HuffPost.This typically leads to people with IBS becoming hyper-vigilant about their symptoms. and trying to be as ready for them as possible — including doing everything in their power to avoid potential triggers. Sometimes these triggers are absolutely accurate. and other times they re merely innocent bystanders.  Cash said.  Either way. we often see patients changing their lifestyle. daily activities. diet. habits and social activities for the sake of avoiding them. Schneider has done what s recommended to treat IBS. She s seen doctors. done the tests. The endoscopy and colonoscopy didn t show anything helpful ― just that she also has gastroesophageal reflux disease. I m on an SSRI. so it isn t anxiety-related. like one doctor so unhelpfully assumed.  she said.  She literally said to me. ‘Well. nothing s shown up in your bloodwork or other tests — you have IBS-D but it s probably all in your head.  Thanks. super helpful. After being poked and prodded enough. Schneider gave up.  I m tired of advocating [for] myself to doctors who won t listen and paying co-pays that are essentially a waste of money to hear the same things over and over. While doctors don t have an IBS biomarker to test for. there are formal diagnostic criteria for IBS called the Rome IV criteria. To make a diagnosis of IBS. patients should meet Rome IV criteria and not have any other ‘alarming  signs such as blood in the stool. unintentional weight loss or new onset symptoms over the age of 50 without prior colon cancer screening.  Tormey said.These criteria must be fulfilled for the past three months. with symptom onset at least six months prior to diagnosis.  IBS should then be sub-classified by the predominant bowel pattern ― such as IBS-C. or IBS with constipation ― which helps guide treatment.  Tormey said.A diagnosis of IBS can be made confidently after a detailed history. a complete physical exam and a few thoughtfully selected diagnostic tests to evaluate for conditions that can present with similar symptoms.So if your doctor implies — or straight-up tells you — your symptoms are all in your head. Méndez encourages you to get a second. third or even fourth opinion.  You know they re not in your head and that IBS is a very real condition.  she said.  In fact. IBS is the most common functional digestive disorder. If you have symptoms. please keep seeking help until you find a health care provider you trust. ,Health News
COVID-19.The new variants. labeled BA.4 and BA.5. are offshoots of the omicron strain that has been been responsible for nearly all of the virus spread in the U.S. and are even more contagious than their predecessors. White House doctors stressed the importance of getting booster doses. even if you have recently been infected. Currently. many Americans are under-vaccinated. meaning they are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines.  said Dr. Rochelle Walensky. director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines provides the best protection against severe outcomes. Walensky said the U.S. has seen a doubling in the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 since April. reflecting the spread of the new subvariants. though deaths remain steady around 300 per day.Dr. Anthony Fauci. the nation s top infectious disease expert. said while the new variants are concerning. with boosters. indoor masking and treatments the country has the tools to keep them from being disruptive. We should not let it disrupt our lives.  he said.  but we cannot deny that it is a reality that we need to deal with. He added that even if someone recently had COVID-19. they should get a booster. Immunity wanes. so it is critical to stay up to date with COVID 19 vaccines.  he said.All Americans age 5 and over should get a booster five months after their initial primary series. according to the CDC. and those age 50 and over — or those who are immunocompromised — should get a second booster four months after their first. According to CDC. tens of millions of eligible Americans haven t received their first booster. and of those over 50 who got their first booster. only 28% have received their second. If you re over 50 and you haven t gotten the shot this year. you should go get a shot.  said White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha.  It s going to save your life. Jha and Fauci said the U.S. is regularly discussing expanding eligibility for a second booster shot to all adults. but that no decision has been made yet. It s a regulatory decision on the part of the FDA.  Fauci said.Jha said people who are eligible for a booster but haven t received one shouldn t wait for forthcoming vaccines targeted at the omicron strain in addition to the original form of the coronavirus. The U.S. has ordered 105 million of those updated shots. which studies show provide better protection against omicron variants. but they won t be available until the fall. Let me be clear. if you get vaccinated today. you re not going to be ineligible to get the variants specific vaccine. as we get into the later part of fall and winter.  Jha said.  So. this is not a tradeoff. we ve got plenty. It s a great way to protect yourself. Added Fauci.  The threat to you is now. Walensky noted that CDC data shows that about a third of Americans are living in areas the agency classifies as experiencing a high level of COVID spread. where the agency recommends people wear masks in public indoor spaces. Another 41% live in the CDC s  medium  level. where it recommends that people consider their own individual risk and consider masking.,Health News
In July 2019 ― while fires blazed from the Amazon to Alaska during what was. at the time. the planet s hottest month ever recorded ― Berkeley. California. became the first U.S. city to ban newly constructed buildings from using natural gas for heating and cooking.Nearly 15% of globe-heating emissions in the U.S. come from buildings. and the Berkeley ban marked a major step toward reducing the amount of invisible. disease-causing air pollutants that gas furnaces and stovetops spew into homes and businesses. Several big cities. including San Francisco. Seattle and New York. have followed suit.But the backlash quickly overtook the bandwagon. As of this month. at least 20 states. virtually all of them under Republican control. have passed laws banning their cities and towns from prohibiting new gas hookups. Some states even considered allowing gas utilities to charge customers who terminate their service a four-figure  exit fee. Now Democratic-controlled New Jersey could become the next state to enact legislation that would make it harder to quit using fossil fuels in buildings.The proposal to add extra bureaucratic barriers to banning fossil fuel heating systems comes on the heels of an industry lobbying blitz. and represents what advocates see as a bid to block electrification long enough for companies to beat the odds and produce a large supply of low-carbon fuel. With U.S. emissions soaring and the window to avoid catastrophic global warming closing. a state where roughly 85% of households depend on gas. fuel oil or propane has little time to spare.But the legislation highlights legitimate fears over how the U.S.  piecemeal approach to weaning its economy off fossil fuels might pinch ordinary people in a country where less than half the population can afford a surprise $1.000 expense ― and where millions are bracing for blackouts as the increasingly fragile electricity grid buckles. The bill from state Senate Majority Conference Leader Vin Gopal (D) would prohibit the state government from adopting a rule or regulation  mandating electric heating or water heating systems  before the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs can complete a two-year assessment of what it would cost. and hold public hearings in every part of the state.No such rule requiring homeowners and landlords to replace functioning fuel systems is under consideration. and no major environmental groups are proposing policies that would force homeowners to make a sudden switch. But the energy master plan  that Gov. Phil Murphy (D) released in January 2020 promised to  incentivize the transition  to electric heating and  develop a transition plan to a fully electrified building sector.  And his administration s lone proposed regulation on heating would force big commercial buildings to start phasing out fossil-fueled heating after 2025. There s been mixed reports on if electrification is the only way to get to 100% clean renewables.  Gopal told HuffPost.  I want to make sure we do it in a way that doesn t dramatically increase costs on average working-class families. Town hall hearings and cost-benefit analyses are already features of the state rulemaking process. And even if a proposed mandate from a state agency makes it through months of public comment and expert scrutiny. New Jersey s Constitution still gives the bicameral legislature the right to vote by simple majority to veto any executive branch policy. There isn t anything in this bill that won t occur already.  said David Pringle. a consultant who works with the climate advocacy group Empower NJ.  These legislators have the best of intentions. but they ve been sold a false bill of goods. Rather than task the state s environmental or utility regulators with analyzing the effects of building decarbonization. the legislation would grant new powers to an agency that has in the past resisted updating the state building codes to the newest. most energy-efficient benchmarks and. as recently as March. challenged new rules intended to curb stormwater flooding. The bill really is a solution in search of a problem.  said Eric Miller. the director of New Jersey policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.  What we really see it as is a naked attempt by the fossil fuel industry to protect their bottom line by bullying states and cities in an effort to delay the transition to electrified buildings. 89% scorevotedBut the lawmaker hasn t totally shunned the industry. either. Leaders from New Jersey s largest building-trades unions. which have historically advocated for the drilling and pipeline businesses that employ their workers. attended Gopal s wedding in 2019.Last August. Gopal s reelection campaign accepted a $6.500 donation from the Fuel Merchants Association of New Jersey. a trade group representing nearly 600 petroleum sellers. In October. as Gopal battled to keep his seat amid a GOP wave. he received $1.500 from New Jersey Resources. a $4.3 billion gas utility.Christina Zuk. Gopal s wife. is a lobbyist at Princeton Public Affairs Group who works for companies including BP America and pipeline builders Kinder Morgan and T.C. Energy. Her employer. considered New Jersey s largest and most influential lobbying firm. counts among its clients the New Jersey Propane Gas Association. In 2019. that trade group sent a letter to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities opposing the governor s plan to incentivize the transition to electric heating and appliances. The letter was submitted by David Smith. Zuk s colleague at Princeton Public Affairs Group and another guest at the couple s wedding. Smith later submitted a public comment in support of Gopal s bill. (Smith didn t respond to an email requesting comment.)Gopal told HuffPost he does not know who his wife s clients are. and scoffed at the implication that he would legislate on their behalf. My wife works for a big firm. and she s worked there since long before I entered the legislature.  he said.  People will try to find a $500 donation and try to throw a conspiracy theory off of it when we all know that s really not how politics works. If anything. he said.  by their logic I shouldn t be doing this bill.  since he s an active member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. a union that has supported electrification proposals in New Jersey.It was another union that he said stoked his concern. Last year. Gopal said. he met with workers at UA Local 9. the New Jersey union representing pipe fitters and plumbers — people who would lose their jobs if the types of rules that mandate electrification in other states were put in place here. Murphy s energy plan was vague. but that ambiguity became a Rorschach test in which opponents of electrification saw the clear contours of similar regulations. Chief among them was the Fuel Merchants Association. This trade group spent more than $1.4 million on a public anti-electrification campaign last year. making it the state s third largest lobbying entity in 2021. according to the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. The spree marked a 979% increase from the $132.000 the Fuel Merchants Association spent on lobbying in 2020. The campaign launched an advocacy website and sponsored op-eds in USA Today. But much of the money went to airing 30-second television advertisements across the state that warned of a looming  $20.000 heat tax. That was a back-of-the-napkin estimate ― almost certainly inflated in most cases ― that was meant to illustrate the cost of swapping a gas- or oil-fired home heating system for an electric one. Making the switch requires not only buying a new appliance. but also hiring an electrician to rewire the house.Inflated estimates or not. the ads worked. Gopal s office started receiving emails from constituents across the district. Stretching from the central Jersey Shore inland about 15 miles. the 11th legislative district has an aging population and a growing share of elderly residents living in single-family homes. according to a 2017 Monmouth County study. Older ratepayers are especially vulnerable to utility price spikes. particularly if they rely on Social Security or retirement funds as their sole source of income. The cost of installing electric heating is not set in stone. States provide a range of rebates. with Massachusetts offering residents up to $10.000 to go electric. New federal legislation targeting heat pump manufacturers could slash the price and increase the availability of the machines. Likewise. the long-term operating costs of electric and fossil heating systems are not static. Northeastern states have some of the highest electricity prices in the country. Their per-unit price of natural gas. by contrast. tends to be closer in line with the national average than that of power. That would suggest an electricity bill that includes heating would cost more than the combined sum of separate gas and electric services. In all but two of the 15 cities examined in a recently published government studyratepayers who went fully electric and avoided fixed charges for gas service saved up to almost $700 per year.A misstep by New Jersey s Department of Environmental Protection seemed to lend credence to the argument that electric costs more. When the agency proposed its rule to stop permitting new fossil fuel heating appliances in buildings with systems at least 10 times larger than the average home. the regulators initially projected the operational costs of an electric boiler to be between 4.2% and 4.9% higher than the average gas unit. As it happened. though. this was an error — the regulators later amended the estimate. saying the costs would actually be 4.2 to 4.9 times higher.The Fuel Merchants Association seized on the mistake as proof that electric heating mandates would quintuple utility bills. But this was a flawed argument. because the Department of Environmental Protection based its comparison on electric resistance boilers. which are more expensive to operate ― not on heat pump systems. which are much more efficient than both electric-resistance and fuel-fired boilers. The agency also used 2018 data that didn t reflect the recent significant spike in gas costs compared to electricity prices.Natural gas prices surged to a 14-year high last month alone. as a result of policies that failed to account for how the pandemic and the war in Ukraine would shape supply and demand. As the planet grows hotter. the resulting political and economic upheaval is likely to send even more shock waves through the global fossil fuel market. Because electric heating is far more efficient. it s less sensitive on average to fossil fuel price spikes. even though the U.S. grid is still powered primarily by gas and coal. Last fall. federal energy researchers released a study finding that U.S. households heating primarily with natural gas would spend at least 30% more than the previous winter s average. Homes with oil heating were on track to spend 43% more. and propane customers were looking at a 54% price spike.By contrast. households heating primarily with electricity only faced a 6% cost increase last winter. Once the U.S. grid depends less on fossil fuels. electric heating prices should. in theory. be even steadier. Ratepayers who used all-electric heating in Quebec. where vast hydroelectric dams power one of Canada s lowest-carbon electric grids. enjoyed some of the biggest annual cost savings. the government study found.Looming over these scenarios. however. is the question of how a systemic shift away from gas might affect the availability and prices of fuel during the transition. Fixing pipelines. inking new supply deals. maintaining a fleet of tanker trucks ― these things all cost money. and if companies cannot expect to recoup it under policies that aim to depress demand for fuel in the long run. there is little incentive to make those investments.Absent some tool for centrally coordinating the transition. ensuring that efficiency increases and clean alternatives grow at a faster rate than dirty infrastructure comes offline. there may be little reason. by the market s logic. to have gas supplies ready when other systems fail.  You think the natural gas company is going to maintain the gas distribution lines simply for when the power goes out?  said Eric DeGesero. the Fuel Merchants Association s executive vice president.Cost wasn t the only concern the Fuel Merchants Association s ads stoked. The clip claimed that electric heat pumps  will not keep your home warm or comfortable when temperatures drop below freezing during our New Jersey winters. Electric heat pumps are among the most popular ways to heat buildings without relying on fuel. There are also electric boilers. which use power instead of fuel to heat and circulate water. Those are hardly the only options. Geothermal heating systems. which circulate warmth from underground. are growing quickly on the East Coast. States like New York are set to start experimenting with European-style district heating. where heat. like electricity. is generated centrally and piped into homes. It s unclear what range of options New Jersey might pursue under the Murphy administration s energy master plan. It s true that heat pumps have. historically. struggled in freezing temperatures. when there s less warm air to pull in from outside. That s partly why the appliances are most widely used in the Western and Southeastern U.S.. where housing stock is newer and winters are milder.But heat pump technology has improved significantly in recent years. A program at the Department of Energy aimed at pushing manufacturers to develop more reliable cold-weather heat pumps has already borne fruit. Last month. the agency named the appliance maker Lennox as the first to meet its new standards. Some of Europe s coldest countries ― Norway. Estonia. Finland. Sweden and Denmark ― now have. in that order. the highest rates of heat pump adoption in the region. Maine. which gives residents up to $1.200 to install a heat pump. has an even higher adoption rate than Norway. It s an often repeated myth about heat pumps that they don t work in cold weather.  said Kevin Kircher. an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who researches heat pumps.  Not every heat pump is going to perform 100% of the time in every place. but it s not hard to find a heat pump that will. It s reaching the point where even the mainstream heat pumps developed by U.S. manufacturers can perform year round anywhere in the U.S.. except maybe Alaska. The business of refining. selling and delivering combustible fuels will likely never go away. But where those fuels come from. and what they are used for. is hotly debated. The industry sees a profitable future where selling burnable methane and hydrogen produces minimal emissions. Renewable natural gas ― a fuel harvested from waste such as livestock manure. rotting garbage or sewage sludge ― adds relatively little heat-trapping gas to the atmosphere and functions just like fossil gas from deep underground. The same is true of synthetic natural gas. a fuel made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen produced with renewably powered electrolyzers. Like the globally traded commodity liquefied natural gas. these nascent fuels are known in the industry by acronyms: RNG and SNG. respectively. These fuels are available today. But they are expensive and in extremely short supply. No clear evidence exists that those industries could provide nearly enough fuel to match current residential demand for pipeline gas at any point in the next few decades. Even the gas industry s own optimistic numbers show low-carbon methane fuels barely seizing a double-digit percentage of demand for pipeline gas. preciousOneotherleaks twice as muchAll of which points to electrification needing to do the vast share of the work of slashing emissions from buildings in the near term.In New Jersey. that task is especially daunting. More than 75% of the state s households heat with natural gas. and 7.4% do so with fuel oil ― far above the national averages. according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. About 2% of households rely on propane. roughly half the national average. Less than 14% use electricity for heat. nearly three times below the national average.Still. as industry groups pushed Gopal s bill. they promoted another piece of legislation to boost renewable natural gas. in what advocates saw as the second part of a two-pronged legislative strategy to keep the gas business alive in New Jersey. At an industry expo at the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut in May. Rich Carrione. a public relations consultant. warned the audience gathered for a panel on  the heating industry s response to electrification  that most states  decarbonization goals were  not going to be possible with petroleum products.  Instead. he said that renewable natural gas and biodiesel. a fuel made from plant or animal fats. offered  attractive alternatives.  Make no mistake. I m still hearing people think that this is all going to go away. it s a political movement. it s a liberal agenda. with the next election we re not going to be facing this issue anymore.  Carrione said. according to audio of the talk obtained by HuffPost.  That is not true. These issues are real. and they re not going away. So we are at a crossroads where we have to embrace low-carbon heating to carve out a place in the future.  But the Fuel Merchants Association expressed a more hawkish view later at the event. DeGesero. the group s leader. compared the battle against building electrification to the Allies  campaign against Nazi Germany. Casting family-owned fuel businesses as outgunned heroes in this looming struggle. he urged the audience to join the fight and get political by supporting bills like Gopal s. paying dues to regional trade groups and mustering grassroots opposition to electrification. Maybe. as Churchill said. this isn t the beginning of the end. but rather. the end of the beginning ― the beginning of the next three generations of the business that Great-grandpa started three generations ago.  DeGesero said.  Either way. Great-grandpa is proud. You are fighting with all of your abilities to sustain what he started all those generations ago. Good luck. Godspeed. In what he described as an unusual step. DeGesero admitted at the conference that his group worked with gas utilities on this campaign. Gopal s bill may have passed overwhelmingly last year. but senators approved it knowing there was no matching legislation in the New Jersey Assembly. The vote was largely symbolic.This year. the Assembly has a version of the bill that was introduced by state Assemblyman Paul Moriarty. a Democrat from the state s southwestern region. It is the first time I ve seen a state legislature try to rein in a governor s authority in the building electrification context.  said Amy Turner. a senior fellow at Columbia University s Sabin Center on Climate Change Law who researches building-sector emissions. Advocates doubt it will become law in its present form. Even Gopal admitted the bill is largely to make a statement.  Let s be realistic here. This bill is all about a conversation. The governor is never going to sign it. This is a bill that s never going to go anywhere.  Gopal said.  We need to limit gas long-term. Let s just do it in a responsible way.  But Miller. the state policy director at the NRDC. said advancing the bill would send a signal that the playbook the fossil fuel industry has used in red states can be replicated in a subtler form in states like New Jersey.With their product spurring an unprecedented public health crisis and their rivals offering attractive benefits. gas utilities have sought to leverage their incumbency and political might to wage war on virtually any government policy that makes electrification more appealing. In Colorado. an industry-run nonprofit backed by the nation s largest gas-only utility campaigned to block a proposal to eliminate state subsidies for new gas lines. In Austin. Texas. a gas utility ran interference on a proposal to boost electrification. sending legislators line-by-line revisions and marshaling customers to oppose the city s effort. In Oklahoma. regulators last fall weighed allowing the state s biggest natural gas utility to charge customers who quit service to go electric an  exit fee  of up to $1.400. There s a certain irony in opposing New Jersey s efforts to dangle carrots that incentivize electric heating over fuel. according to Pringle. the consultant who works with Empower NJ. Decarbonizing the state s existing buildings ― plus all the new homes. businesses and schools still being built with fossil heating ― will only require more drastic policy measures down the road.Residential and commercial real estate is directly responsible for 13% of the U.S.  greenhouse gas output. thanks largely to fuel-based heating and cooking systems. Counting the portion of power plant emissions linked to buildings  energy use brings that number closer to 40%. At some point. we are going to have to do more than voluntary incentives.  Pringle said. Existing buildings can cost over six times more to retrofit for electrification than if the structures had been wired for electric heating and appliances in the first place. according to a HuffPost analysis of California cost data. Yet the largest trade groups representing homebuilders have worked alongside gas utilities to stave off efforts to make electric-ready circuitry the U.S. standard.  We re opposed to electric-only as the only manner of achieving the objective of net-zero carbon energy.  DeGesero said.  When I walk into a bakery and I want chocolate cake. I don t tell the baker how to make the chocolate cake. When the governor wants net-zero carbon energy. just tell us you want net-zero carbon energy. don t tell us how to get there.  The fossil fuel industry he represents. however. has guarded what kind of ingredients make it into the recipe ― and who gets to write the cookbook. And just last year. it tightened its grip on how U.S. buildings are constructed. Building codes are set on the state and local level. meaning the federal government has little control. But to create some uniformity. all 50 states outsource the highly technical work of code-writing to the International Code Council. a nonprofit consortium of building industry groups. gas utilities and municipal governments.Every three years. the ICC convenes its members. updates the codes and gives delegates representing local governments the final say in a vote. In turn. every state. and some countries in the Caribbean and Asia. codify those generic codes into law. It s usually a pretty sleepy. uneventful affair. In 2019. however. cities fed up with how slowly the energy-related building codes were increasing efficiency and cutting emissions organized to vote for the most ambitious round of codes in years. In response. gas utilities challenged key measures to the ICC s appeals board. arguing that requiring homebuilders to include the circuitry for electric heating. appliances and vehicle charging in new construction was a step too far. The ICC. which has for years given industry groups special treatment. agreed with the gas companies. and yanked those code requirements. Then. in a surprise move. the ICC proposed eliminating local governments  right to vote on energy codes altogether. Despite outcry from the Biden administration. environmentalists and dozens of cities. the ICC made the change permanent last year. Under the new code-writing procedure. which only applies to energy-related codes. industry groups get equal representation with governments on the committees designing the next set round of codes. Even by the standards of the new system. some delegates helping to write the latest codes fear that corporate interests are once again wielding undue influence over the process. after a single email secretly sent from a gas utility nearly torpedoed a new proposal on electric vehicle charging. Industry control over the country s generic codes makes state-level policies that much more important for slashing U.S. emissions to the extent scientists say it will take to avoid catastrophic global warming. said Jeff Tittel. the retired director of New Jersey s Sierra Club chapter. As if to emphasize that point. the Supreme Court last month limited federal regulators  authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate power plant emissions. raising the stakes even higher for states. The country s emissions. which spiked in 2021. are on track to rise again this year. If we end up at 100% electric. I m fine with that.  Gopal said.  Let s just do it in an organized way. a way where we understand the workers that are affected that have good union paying jobs. and how that affects their lifestyle. how that affects the cost on middle-class families that have to switch their heating oil. None of this is laid out in the energy master plan.  But Tittel said Gopal s bill sends the message that New Jersey is  going to stay on natural gas and burn fossil fuels even if it means more fracking. more pipelines. and more indoor air pollution.   The problem I see with this bill is it s basically saying the state of New Jersey is on record stopping or slowing down alternative ways to heat and cool your home that may be greener and. long-term. cheaper.  he said.  This is there to slow progress. ,Health News
President Joe Biden is not backing off plans to nominate an anti-abortion attorney to a lifetime federal judgeship in Kentucky. despite strong opposition from Democrats and reproductive rights groups. according to a source recently briefed on the White House s plans.White House officials have refused to talk about Chad Meredith ever since the Louisville Courier-Journal reported late last month that he is the president s pick for a soon-to-be vacant U.S. District Court seat in eastern Kentucky. The newspaper even provided copies of June 23 emails from the White House to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) confirming Biden s plan to nominate Meredith. a member of the conservative Federalist Society who has fought abortion rights.The White House initially told Beshear that Meredith would be nominated the next day. on June 24. But that turned out to be the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. and the nomination didn t happen. Now it s just crickets. I m just not ― we just don t comment on ― on vacancies. whether executive branch or judicial. in situations where we have not made a nomination.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. when asked about Meredith.  We just have not made a nomination on this yet. But the news is out. and Biden is facing fire from his own party and allies. Beshear called such a nomination  indefensible.  and Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said  the last thing we need is another extremist on the bench.  Eight national abortion rights groups issued a rare joint statement calling Meredith  unacceptable at any time. but especially on the heels of six Supreme Court justices taking away a fundamental right from millions of people. Late Monday. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) similarly raised concerns about the prospect of Biden appointing Meredith to a lifetime federal court seat.told HuffPostIt might have seemed like the White House has been backing off Meredith s potential nomination given its silence in response to the Democratic outcry. But behind the scenes. the White House is apparently signaling that it still plans to move forward with his nomination. They re defending it.  the source briefed last weekon the White House s plan told HuffPost. after requesting anonymity in order to speak freely about private conversations.This source also believes that Meredith would likely be announced as part of a large package of judicial nominees that would include many picks that Democrats do like.None of this is set in stone. It s not clear what Biden may be hoping to get in return for nominating Meredith. It s also not clear when such a package of nominees might be announced. if it is at all.But the president s plan to potentially nominate Meredith may be part of a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to speed up other judicial nominees through a deadlocked Senate. especially ahead of the November midterm elections that could cost Democrats control of the chamber. A McConnell aide previously said he had  great respect for Chad.  when he was being considered for a different court seat in 2019.A little-noticed detail lends support to the idea of Meredith being part of a package deal. too: In the email the White House sent to Beshear indicating its plan to nominate Meredith. White House officials appear to have simply cut and pasted White House language about Meredith into the email ― including the number eight right before Meredith s name. as if he is one in a list of nominees being lumped together.Here s a screen shot of how the language about Meredith appears in the White House email. via the Courier-Journal:More than two dozen progressive organizations last month urged Biden to fill every single court vacancy by the end of the year. given how much more difficult it will be for Democrats to confirm judges if Republicans win control of the Senate. It s possible that the president is taking this approach seriously in light of Meredith s nomination ― i.e.. giving McConnell a nominee he wants in exchange for him not obstructing lots of other court picks ― though this is likely not the kind of trade-off progressive groups were envisioning.A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.A McConnell spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Sen. Tim Kaine is on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is not.,Health News
PHOENIX (AP) — A federal judge in Phoenix on Monday blocked a 2021 state  personhood  law that gives all legal rights to fetuses and that abortion rights groups said put providers at risk of prosecution for a variety of crimes.U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes said in his written ruling that the groups that sued to block the law are right — it is  anyone s guess.  as the state acknowledged. what criminal laws abortion providers may be breaking if they perform otherwise-legal abortions. And that is the problem.  Rayes wrote.  When the punitive and regulatory weight of the entire Arizona code is involved. Plaintiffs should not have to guess at whether their conduct is on the right or the wrong side of the law. Rayes agreed with the challengers that the law appears to be unconstitutionally vague.At least four other states have similar  personhood  laws in effect. including Missouri. Kansas. Georgia and Alabama.It is unclear if abortions that have been halted in Arizona since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that women do not have a constitutional right to abortion would restart. Abortion providers stopped virtually all procedures because a pre-1901 banning all abortions that may be in effect and other laws created too much risk.At least in Pima County. where the 1901 law remains blocked. they could be legal. although Attorney General Mark Brnovich plans to ask a court to lift that order and allow enforcement.Rayes had refused to block the personhood law last year. but abortion rights groups renew their request after Roe v. Wade was struck down.They argued that providers fear they could be charged with child abuse. assault or a litany of other crimes. and that the law was too vague. There is also concern of civil and regulatory action.The attorney general s office told the judge that the personhood law created no new criminal laws. but admitted in their court filings that prosecutors and courts could have a different view.Abortion rights groups hailed the ruling. The court made the right decision today by blocking this law from being used to create an unthinkably extreme abortion ban.  said Jessica Sklarsky. a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights who argued the case.  The Supreme Court s catastrophic decision overturning Roe v. Wade has unleashed chaos on the ground. leaving Arizona residents scrambling to figure out if they can get the abortion care they need. An Arizona attorney general s office spokesperson said they are focused on  bringing clarity to the law for Arizonans.  Today s ruling was based on an interpretation of Arizona law that our office did not agree with. and we are carefully considering our next steps.  spokesperson Brittni Thomason said in an email.An attorney general s office lawyer told Rayes during a July 8 hearing that the law creates no new crimes that could lead to charges. The  personhood  law says all other state laws should be interpreted to bestow all rights to a fetus.The attorney general s office said in court filing that Rayes got it right last September when he refused to block the law. Rayes had cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 1989 where the court declined to block Missouri s nearly identical law.Rayes said he has now changed his mind about the relevance of that case. The Court is now persuaded it was wrong to rely on Webster the first go around.  he wrote.Sklarsky had argued the personhood law is unconstitutionally vague on several fronts and told Rayes that the attorney general said in its court papers that it s  anyone s guess  how state judges or prosecutors might apply the law.Rayes  ruling blocks enforcement of the law while the challenges precede though the court. including a possible trial. Medical providers should not have to guess about whether the otherwise lawful performance of their jobs could lead to criminal. civil. or professional liability solely based on how literally or maximalist state licensing. law enforcement. and judicial officials might construe the Interpretation Policy s command.  Rayes said.States now have wide-ranging rights to limit abortion. and many laws limiting or blocking all abortions that were previously blocked can now be enforced. That has led to battles in many states over which laws are now enforceable.Arizona is in that position. with Republican Gov. Doug Ducey saying a ban on abortions after 15 weeks that he signed in March takes precedence over the pre-1901 law Brnovich said is in effect.There were just over 13.000 abortions in Arizona in 2020. according to the most recent report from the Arizona Department of Health Services. Of those. fewer than 650 were performed after 15 weeks of gestation.,Health News

My 2-year-old. the third baby girl in the family. screamed at the sight of the nurse who d administered her shots months earlier. But all the nurse asked for today was for my daughter to step onto a scale. She d graduated from the infant scale — which required full disrobing and reclining in a cold. awkward receptacle — to the standard kind adults use. Despite the simple request. my little girl refused. wailing until she was nearly purple in the face. the memory of her last round of vaccinations still firmly imprinted. I held her in my arms. trying and failing to calm her down. The nurse looked me in the eye:  Step on the scale with her.  she said. Again. it was a simple request. but I wanted to refuse and wail just like my daughter. With breath held. I stepped onto the scale anyway. I retreated from the platform and handed my girl. who was now somehow screaming louder. to the nurse as I prepared myself for the solo return to complete the arithmetic: I knew it was going to be a bigger number than I d hoped and possibly the heaviest I d ever been as a non-pregnant adult. After all. I d not seen many 65-pound 2-year-olds. I saved my wailing for after the appointment. when I called my husband from the car:  How did this happen to me?  I yelled. He said all the nice things a spouse is supposed to say — you re beautiful. you look great. if you want to lose weight. I ll do it with you. You might think I was upset about the actual number — and in part I was — or that I lamented not politely explaining to the nurse why I wouldn t step on the scale — my daughter was healthy. she d never deviated wildly off the growth chart. and we could always come back when she was feeling less upset. But I was actually asking this: How. at 38 years old and after three children. could a number on the scale shatter me?Starting around 7 or 8 years old. the world taught me about the female body — what was acceptable and what was not. Riding in the back of my neighbor Joey s parents  car. Joey pointed to our pale legs exposed from our shorts and squashed over the bench seat:  Why are your legs so much bigger than mine?  he asked. His mother turned from the front seat. appalled:  We don t talk about people s bodies like that. Joey!  Oh. but we do. Joey s mom. We do. While enthusiastically eating a spaghetti and meatball dinner with my cousins after a fun day at the beach. one cousin told me I was chubby. I can still feel the indignation as I insisted that I ran the third-grade mile test in under eight minutes. Even then I felt the necessity of explanation. of conditioning my size on my athletic ability. I was the biggest of my friends in high school. and I d shrink back when they d pair off with the boys and swing dance (a genre that enjoyed a resurgence under the height of ska in the  90s). embarrassed the boys might not be able to flip me over their shoulders like they did the other girls.Sports saved me for a while: I played on the varsity field hockey and lacrosse teams all four years of high school. It didn t matter what I weighed or how I looked. as long as I could  put the biscuit in the basket.  as one of my coaches used to say. When I stopped playing in college. I started running a lot. and within months I lost 20 pounds. It really seemed as though the world opened up in a new way. I never felt out of place in a room. trying on clothes wasn t stressful and the boys paid much more attention to me. Yet. despite all this. when I went to my family s doctor. she told me to be careful to maintain my weight: She knew that obesity ran in my family.As a young woman. I kept this warning close. and I was pretty careful: I ran a lot and restricted my diet if I started to breach a 5-to-10-pound buffer zone. But then pregnancy threw all of that out the window. Like many women. I felt completely out of control of my physical being during most of my gestation. My body expanded in fits and starts and bounds and leaps. incongruent with the suggested steady pace and neat stop at 25 pounds gained. In the third trimester of my first pregnancy. I cried in a doctor s office after she told me I needed to be careful with my weight — to  watch it.  All I could do was watch it go up and up. unheeding to my daily walks and attempts at diet regulation. While nursing my third child over the course of a year. I sank with disappointment realizing that I was just not  one of those women  whose bodies melted off the baby weight during lactation. Mine. it seemed. held on tighter.Then. about a year ago. I decided to stop weighing myself: I didn t need to obsess over the scale. I planned to focus on staying active. incorporating healthier foods into my diet. cutting back on my alcohol consumption and getting some good rest. And after seeing video of a friend lifting heavy weights at a local gym. something clicked inside of me: I wanted to be strong. too.When I took my daughter to her appointment. I d been lifting with a trainer for over a month. learning about proper form and gaining the confidence to add more plates to the bar. In that short time. I already felt taller and stronger. And perhaps most important. lifting and staying off the scale rooted me more firmly in the present. I made new goals for strength and health instead of looking backward to a number from the past. This shift in perspective allowed space for a different version of me to exist. without shame or remorse.But even though I was steadily increasing the amount I could deadlift and squat and bench. the only number that mattered the day I stepped on that scale was the one on the digital screen. Here was the proof I hadn t been careful. that I d failed.Getting ready for a day at the pool. I watched my 7-year-old pull up her rash guard and examine her stomach — she filled it with air. and it expanded like a balloon before she sucked it back in. a small downward curl on her lips. Had she talked to a Joey? An uncouth cousin? Did she already feel this weight of expectation and the burden of noncompliance with impossible standards? I knew I couldn t pin down one offending messenger with so many waiting in the wings. I wish undoing decades of indoctrination was as easy as saying.  I accept and love my body as it is.  The amount I weigh will always hold some sort of significance. to me and to others. I m afraid. But I m staying off the scale. for now. and instead I concentrate on different numbers: the amount I can press and curl and push. the time it takes me to run my three-mile route. the decreasing amount of Tylenol I take for lower back pain. And best of all: the number of times my girls squeal with delight when I show them videos of me squatting 100 pounds. Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

WASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time. a pharmaceutical company has asked for permission to sell a birth control pill over the counter in the U.S.recent decisionHormone-based pills have long been the most common form of birth control in the U.S.. used by millions of women since the 1960s. They have always required a prescription. generally so health professionals can screen for conditions that raise the risk of rare. but dangerous. blood clots.The French drugmaker s application compiles years of research intended to convince the Food and Drug Administration that women can safely screen themselves for those risks and use the pill effectively. For a product that has been available for the last 50 years. that has been used safely by millions of women. we thought it was time to make it more available.  said Frederique Welgryn. HRA s chief strategy officer.An FDA approval could come next year and would only apply to HRA s pill. which would be sold under its original brand name. Opill. The company acquired the decades-old drug from Pfizer in 2014. but it s not currently marketed in the U.S.abortion pillsThat potential for a precedent-setting decision once again places the FDA under an intense political spotlight.loosened accessPlan BMany conservative groups stress they are only interested in curtailing abortion. and state bans often explicitly exclude contraception.Even before Monday s announcement. Democratic lawmakers were calling on the FDA to swiftly consider any such requests. We urge FDA to review applications for over-the-counter birth control pills without delay and based solely on the data.  said more than 50 members of the House s Pro-Choice Caucus in a March letter.Many common medications have made the switch from behind the pharmacy counter. including drugs for pain relief. heartburn and allergies.In each case. companies must show that consumers can understand the drug s labeling. evaluate its risks and use it safely and effectively without professional supervision. HRA spent seven years conducting the FDA-required studies. including a trial that followed 1.000 women taking its pill for six months.Behind the company s efforts is a coalition of women s health researchers and advocates who have worked for nearly two decades to make contraceptives more accessible. especially to groups with less access to health care.The Oral Contraceptives Over-the-Counter Working Group helped fund some of HRA s research and is mobilizing support behind a media campaign dubbed Free the Pill. A lot of our research has been about making the case to help inspire and support a company to take this work on.  said Kelly Blanchard. president of Ibis Reproductive Health. a group member that supports abortion and contraceptive access.Birth control pills are available without a prescription across much of South America. Asia and Africa. Last year. Paris-based HRA won U.K. approval for the first birth control pill available there without a prescription.Advocates were particularly interested in HRA s drug because they say it s likely to raise fewer safety concerns.The pill contains a single synthetic hormone. progestin. which prevents pregnancy by blocking sperm from the cervix.Most birth control pills contain progestin plus estrogen. which can help make periods lighter and more regular. Progestin-only pills are generally recommended for women who can t take the more popular combination pills due to health issues.But estrogen also accounts for most of the blood clot risk associated with oral contraceptives. FDA s labeling warns against their use in certain women already at risk for heart problems. such as those who smoke and are over 35.For most women. the drugs are overwhelmingly safe. For every 10.000 women taking combination pills annually. three to nine will suffer a blood clot. according to FDA data. That compares with one to five clots among 10.000 women who aren t taking birth control.And medical professionals point out that blood clot rates are much higher in women who become pregnant. when hormone levels and reduced blood flow increase clotting risk. What I definitely see is a misunderstanding of the dangers of these pills. It is much safer to take the pill than to be pregnant  said Dr. Maura Quinlan. a Northwestern University physician and member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She was not involved in HRA s application or research.The medical association supports unrestricted access too all hormone-based contraceptives over the counter. Last month. the nation s largest physician group. the American Medical Association. endorsed making birth control pills available for over-the-counter purchase without an age requirement.Still. support is not universal.Diana Zuckerman of the nonprofit National Center for Health Research says comparing the safety risks of the pills with pregnancy is not the right approach.Many women take birth control pills to regulate their periods or reduce bleeding. said Zuckerman. whose group evaluates medical research.  Those are real benefits. but they are not worth the risk of potentially fatal blood clots.  she said.The FDA has long monitored the safety of oral contraceptives. updating their warnings over the years.Last year. the agency placed a hold on a study by drugmaker Cadence Health. which has also been working on an over-the-counter pill. The agency told the company to conduct additional blood pressure checks of trial participants. The company says it is  working to overcome this regulatory hurdle. The FDA is required to hold a public meeting to evaluate HRA s application before making a decision. Safety considerations are likely to take center stage.Executives at HRA. which is owned by Perrigo Co.. expect a decision in the first half of 2023.Advocates hope it will be the first of many. Once we see the approval of this product. it will demonstrate that it s possible and that the data is strong.  Blanchard said.  Hopefully we ll see the process speed up from here. ,Health News
Back pain is inconvenient and. unfortunately. incredibly common ― 4 out of 5 adults will have low back pain at some point in their lives. according to the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine. If you are one of the nearly 65 million Americans who report a recent episode of back pain or one of the 16 million adults with persistent back pain. then you know how miserable it can be.But it s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your back pain — was it from spending hours on your laptop or sleeping in a weird position? Did mopping the floor or working in the garden make it flare up? Your back pain could even be a combination of all four. or something else entirely. So. how do you stop it? From near-constant dull aches to sharp jolts of pain that appear with movement. back pain ranges from uncomfortable to debilitating. And you could be making it worse without realizing it. The way you sit. scroll Instagram. and do other common activities could contribute to the way your back feels.  Have you ever got to the end of your day and felt achiness or pain in your back. and you are not sure what caused it? This is a common occurrence.  said Kelly Kessler. a physical therapist. wellness coach and founder of Optimal You Health and Wellness. LLC.  In fact. most cases of back pain do not result from a fall or a sudden injury. the majority occur from an unknown onset. Below. you ll find a selection of habits that may be contributing to your back pain. Bad posture is one of the main culprits of back pain.  Sitting hunched puts pressure on the lower back and can lead to pain and spasm due to the change in the normal curvature of the spine.  said Dr. Febin Melepura. the medical director at Sports Injury & Pain Management Clinic of NYC. who is double board-certified in anesthesiology and pain management.Slouching over your computer. for example. can lead to  changes in the normal posture of our spine.  Melepura said. Do this for a long time. and it can lead to back pain  due to the prolonged pressure exerted on the spinal discs.  he added.Working from home can make sitting in this position even more tempting. Demetris Elia. a mobile chiropractor with PEAKiropractic in Dallas. said that some of his patients  have been working from the couch for the past two years. so they have developed significant lower and upper back pain. He called slouching  the worst habit we have in today s society.  because  it compromises the lumbar spine (low back). which does not allow the rest of the spine to be in a biomechanically advantageous position.  This causes joints to restrict and muscles to tighten  in an attempt to compensate.  leading  pain and inflammation to develop along the spine. Looking down at your phone (or tablet or book) can lead to  upper back and neck pain/discomfort.  according to Elia.This can make  the spine and muscles of the upper back work overtime to try and prevent the head from going even further in front.  he said. before describing the proper position as one where  the ears sit center to the shoulders.   Sitting for too long. often in chairs with poor support and which are wildly uncomfortable. can definitely be a significant contributor to back pain.  said Dr. Grant D. Shifflett. an orthopedic spine surgeon for DISC Sports & Spine Center in California.He suggested making the investment in ergonomic office furniture. as well as  sitting with your core neutral. lumbar support. a footrest. having good wrist support for your keyboard and mouse. getting a convertible sitting or standing desk. and keeping the computer screen at eye level.  There s a reason your Apple Watch reminds you to get up every hour — these mini breaks can help your back.  Today s average desk worker uses a laptop and spends hours on a keyboard. which causes cumulative exhaustion in the spinal support muscles.  said Sridhar Yalamanchili. a physical therapist with Atlantic Spine Center. He suggests taking  mini breaks comprising of simple stretches for the back. neck and chest muscles. The way you walk can impact the way your back feels.  If you are a foot slapping walker. look no further for the cause of your back pain.  said Veera Gupta. a chiropractor at Optimum Health Chiropractic in New Jersey.  Feet are meant to move in a curvilinear pattern. arching from the heel to the toes and using every one of the intrinsic muscles of the foot to take each and every step.  Gupta explained. This means if you are flat-footed. slap your feet when you walk. or walk without arch support.  the foot collapses and the kinetic chain of energy ends in your back. causing lower back pain.  The human spine was designed for movement.  said Dr. Neel Anand. a professor of orthopedic surgery and director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Spine Center in Los Angeles.  Between the time we spend asleep and the addition of eight hours of a workday in a seated position for many people. no wonder our spines are screaming in pain. Many of us are spending most hours in a day not moving around. To fix this. Anand suggests working out and walking.  Exercise (yes. this includes the simple act of walking) nourishes the spine and strength for its surrounding muscles.  he said.  If you re someone who is often sedentary and battles back pain and stiffness. try walking for at least 30 minutes every day.  This is an easy way to build strength to protect your back. Has your back felt tight and sore after a workout? Stretching can help. Stretching every day is an excellent way to prevent back pain and spasms.  Anand said.  It doesn t need to be yoga. but you should make it a point to stretch your back. legs. arms and neck every day.  A strong core is important for optimal back health. Try incorporating more core work ― like forearm planks. dead bugs and bicycles ― in your regular fitness routine. Strengthening the core muscles is key to reducing back pain overall.  said Dr. Ronald Barton Tolchin medical director of Miami Neuroscience Institute s Spine Center. He explained that this  can help avoid back pain because it takes stress off the disc and facet joints. Make sure you are using proper form and body mechanics to  avoid increased stress on the spine.  Tolchin added.  Use the leg muscles when bending forward. For example. performing a squat or lunge to get down to the ground to pick something up.  Also. it is important to avoid bending forward with a round back to decrease the load on the spine.  he continued.  Instead. a flat back position or the back arched backward would use more of the hip joint while bending and can be quite helpful for the spine. Anand recommends finding the right pillows that support your back while you sleep. This includes a pillow  that keeps your neck parallel to the mattress and that adapts to your specific sleep position.  Cervical contour pillows are  extremely effective.  according to Anand. because they elevate your neck more when sleeping on your side and less when sleeping on your back. If you have a firmer mattress. use a thicker pillow  because there is less cushion for your shoulder to sink into and thus there is a greater space between your mattress and head.  he said. If it s a memory foam mattress. you ll need a thinner pillow  to compensate for your shoulder sinking into the bed.  he added.Did you know that stress can cause back pain. too?  Stress plays an enormous role in the mind-body connection that governs how we feel.  said Shifflett. who explained that people can  carry their stress  in their lower back or neck. Danny Lehnert. a physical therapist and board-certified orthopedic specialist in Virginia. agreed. noting that  80% of people will have low back pain at some point in their lives. and it is completely normal to have aches and pains. If you re concerned about your back pain. make an appointment to see your doctor. Powering through the pain could cause long-term injuries. and it s better to get it checked out sooner. ,Health News

A Pennsylvania 911 operator faces a rare charge of involuntary manslaughter for failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who died of internal bleeding a day later. despite a plea from the woman s daughter that without medical help  she s going to die. A Greene County detective last week filed charges against Leon  Lee  Price. 50. of Waynesburg. in the July 2020 death of Diania Kronk. 54. based on Price s reluctance to dispatch help without getting more assurance that Kronk would actually go to the hospital. I believe she would be alive today if they would have sent an ambulance.  said Kronk s daughter Kelly Titchenell. 38.Price. who also was charged with reckless endangerment. official oppression and obstruction. questioned Titchenell repeatedly during the four-minute call about whether Kronk would agree to be taken for treatment.Price was arraigned June 29 and released on bail. He did not reply to messages left at a home number listed in his name. and officials said a defense lawyer has not contacted district court. It has to be very clear throughout the entire state. that when you call it s not going to be conditioned on somebody on the other end of the phone saying there s going to be a service provided or not.  said Lawrence E. Bolind Jr.. who represents Titchenell in a federal lawsuit filed last month.  What we re trying to do here is make this never happen to somebody else. In the 911 recording. an operator identified by police as Price replied to Titchenell s description of her mother as needing hospital treatment by asking if she was  willing to go  to the hospital about a half-hour away from where she was living in Sycamore. She will be.  cause I m on my way there. so she s going. or she s going to die.  Titchenell told Price as she drove from her home in Mather.Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that  we really need to make sure she s willing to go.  She s going to go. she s going to go.  Titchenell said.  Cause if not. she s going to die. there s nothing else.  She said that Kronk was not thinking clearly and that she was her mother s closest relation. When Price again asked if Kronk would in fact go. Titchenell replied:  OK. well. can we just try? After Titchenell told Price she was about 10 minutes from her mother s home. Price asked if Titchenell would call 911 back once she made sure Kronk was willing to go in an ambulance. I m sorry.  Titchenell said. and Price replied:  No. don t be sorry. ma am. Just call me when you get out there. OK? When Titchenell and her three children arrived at the house. she said. Kronk was nude on the front porch and talking incoherently. She got her mother to put on a robe. She just kept saying she was OK. she s fine.  Titchenell said.  She s the mom. you know — she doesn t listen to her children. Titchenell said she could not call from the home because her mother s landline could not be located and there was not cell service. She also did not call on her way home. believing that her uncle would soon check on her and that another contact with 911 would be pointless. This is unheard of. to me. I mean. they ll send an ambulance for anything.  Titchenell said.  And here I am telling this guy that my mom s going to die. It s. like. her death. and she doesn t get an ambulance. Her brother found the next day that their mother had died.The prosecutor. Greene County District Attorney Dave Russo. said he is also investigating whether there was any policy or training under which the county s 911 dispatchers were allowed to refuse services to callers. We all deserve equal protections. and we all deserve access to medical services.  Russo said in an interview.  I have a major concern as to the safety of the community in regards to this. John Kelly. a Naperville. Illinois. lawyer who is general counsel to the National Emergency Number Association. said criminal charges against dispatchers for failing to send help are very rare but have happened.In a case Kelly teaches in dispatcher training. a 911 operator in Detroit received a year of probation in 2008 and lost her job after. authorities said. she did not take seriously a boy s calls to report his mother had collapsed. The 5-year-old boy testified that the dispatcher accused him of playing games and hung up on him. while the dispatcher testified that she could not hear the child.Titchenell. on behalf of her mother s estate. sued Price and Greene County in Pittsburgh federal court last month. along with two 911 supervisors. The lawsuit accuses Price of  callous refusal of public emergency medical services. Marie Milie Jones. a lawyer for the county and 911 supervisors in the federal case. said her clients plan to vigorously defend the lawsuit and do not believe they are liable for Kronk s death. She said there are  personnel matters that are ongoing  regarding Price but declined to elaborate. It s unfortunate that this woman had died. Certainly. from a personal standpoint. that s very difficult.  Jones said.  I m not going to comment on the details of her circumstances. Titchenell told Price that her mother had been drinking heavily for some weeks before she died. and that Titchenell had noticed she was losing weight and was  turning yellow.  She said the autopsy concluded Kronk. who worked in home health care. died of internal bleeding.She said she thinks about her late mother every day — how the former longtime sub shop manager loved to cook. to help people and to spoil her five grandchildren. how she would pile a mountain of presents under the tree every Christmas. She had the biggest heart.  Titchenell said.  If someone didn t have a place to live. she was going to take them in. give them a bed. That was Mom. ,Health News

It s been 10 hours since I ve given birth to our third child and even though everything has gone perfectly. I sense something is wrong. Our son is sleeping on my chest. his fingers clutching the neckline of my hospital gown. I disentangle myself from our baby and pass him to my spouse. I don t feel well.  I tell him. already summoning the nurse.  I m bleeding too much and I feel lightheaded. He asks me questions I m too dizzy to answer. I ve had pregnancy and delivery complications in the past. The blood flowing into my pad is constant and much too heavy even for after a vaginal delivery. I call my nurse into the room a few times. The last time she roughly checks the blood flow. This is normal.  she insists. explaining everything to me as though this is my first time. Something s wrong.  I insist. sitting up. But she s already gone. disregarding my concerns for the third time.I get off the bed and gingerly make my way to the bathroom. every step a jolt producing more and more blood — so much blood it starts streaming down my legs. I see a trail of crimson splashing on white tiles. feel it rolling down between my thighs. hot and fast. I walk through my own blood unable to avoid it. becoming more and more weary with each step.By the time I reach the toilet. I barely have enough energy to pull down my underpants and sit. I hear the flow of liquid constantly pour into the toilet. though I m not yet urinating. I look down. When I see how rapidly blood is gushing from my body. I try to call out to my partner. but my voice is so weak it scares me. I blink hard. unable to focus. The room blurs. Just as my hand slips from the silver bar next to me. I instinctively grab the emergency rope.Then everything goes black.When I regain consciousness. I m back on the bed. nurses swarming around me. I see my partner s head swimming just behind the wall they ve created between us. My gown is up around my belly. my legs are splayed open. and I feel blood still pouring from my body. Nurses are sopping it up with towels and weighing them on a scale next to me. More nurses mop up the floor with towels and add them to the growing pile of bloodied towels.One of my doctors flies into the room. She washes her hands and sits between my legs. She pumps my belly with one hand and pushes the other into my vagina. I feel all the stitches that were just put in 10 hours ago rip. Using two gloved fingers as a hook. she pulls clot after clot from my body. each one larger and more difficult to remove than the one before it.I scream. writhing on the bed. The nurses shut the door and hold me down while she works. Krystal. I need to get these out.  she explains. holding up the viscous clots for me to see. She then asks for my permission to continue. I nod but the pain crackles through every nerve in my body. It is hot and hard. and I can t control my reactions as she pumps on my belly with one hand again and inserts the other into my vagina. I come close to blacking out and I m only able to see when she pulls back. Blood continues to pour from me. I need to take you into surgery immediately. I am splayed out on the bed. bloodied and exhausted. I want to cry and sleep and feed my newborn baby. I don t fully understand it s a life-or-death decision and she needs an answer now. I can t do anything more like this.  she says.There is so much urgency in her words and behind her eyes. I look to my partner who is clutching our newborn child and I think about our two daughters. ages 3 and 5. at home with my parents. How could something go so drastically wrong after a healthy pregnancy and perfect delivery?I nod to my doctor and she springs into action. The way everyone is frantically moving. it s like a scene from a movie. except I m living it and once I leave this room. I may never return. The nurses close my legs for me then cover and wrap me up. They start wheeling me out of the hospital room and now I m the one who s frantic. looking to my spouse who is still clutching our son. the terror in his eyes like I ve never seen before matching what I feel inside. Would that be the last thing I ever saw? Is this how I will die? Will I never get to nuzzle my girls again. read them a book. fall asleep with their hair all around my face? Will I never get to see our son yawn and giggle and stretch and learn to walk and talk? Will I never get to know them? Call my mom. Come with me. Please!  I m crying as we start moving. I don t want to leave our son alone but when he hands the baby to the nearest nurse and sprints to me. I cry even more. He holds me tightly as they wheel my bed to the operating room. I m so cold I start shivering and nothing they do can make me warm. Krystal. I don t know what we re going to find when we get in there. Those are the last words my doctor says to me. Honey. I love you. You are my everything.  Those are the last words my partner and I say to each other.And then I m in the operating room with both his words and the doctor s echoing in my head. Am I leaving behind children who will be motherless and a partner who will be alone? And what about my parents? They ll only have one daughter instead of two. And my only sister? She ll have no sibling at all.We whispered our I love yous but it isn t nearly enough. This man has been everything to me. This kind of love that s perfect and pure. I see his green eyes glittering behind tears as he watches me go ― this man I met when he was just 14 years old. The last thing I see are the fluorescent operating room lights being adjusted by bloody blue gloves. My blood glows down on me below the two large circles of light.***usually happens within one day of giving birthStanford Children s HealthThe most important thing to know about PPH is that it s preventable.

PPH affects 14 million women100.000 live births in 199123.8 in 2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sFrom what nurses could collect and measure. they calculated I d lost a half-gallon of blood. In 15 minutes. That is 30% to 40% of a person s blood volume. If you lose more than 40%. your organs will stop working and it s likely. because your body can t compensate for much longer. you ll slip into a coma. I d been entering dangerous territory when they revived me on the bed.After uterine massages didn t work to help with my contractions. my doctor needed to take me into emergency surgery. When she said the words that have haunted me and changed my perception on life —  I don t know what we re going to find when we get in there  — it could have meant anything from a hysterectomy to death. I emerged alive but damaged. scarred and completely lost. After everything I went through. I declined a blood transfusion. terrified something else could happen if I took on the blood of another human being. By refusing the blood transfusion. my recovery dragged on for more than a year. To walk a handful of steps without enough blood coursing through my veins rendered me as helpless as the infant I was supposed to be taking care of. Getting to the bathroom left me a shivering. sweaty mess. unable to make the journey back to bed.On top of the physical challenge of healing. I was psychologically traumatized and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. I couldn t sleep. As soon as I did. I d wake up screaming and thrashing. the bloodied operating room lights burned on the inside of my eyelids. This went on for years. Thanks to my family. I had help putting myself back together. But I often think about the women who don t have any community or support. What happens to them and their children? If I hadn t lost almost 40% of my blood as rapidly as I did. no one would have caught it. I could have been discharged. The next time I would have been scheduled to see a doctor after vaginal delivery would have been six weeks later. What if that scene transpired when I was home alone with my baby and unable to get to a phone?Focusing only on the baby after childbirth is dangerous. Women are sent home too early and not given the proper support and medical care they need. Even after the trauma I experienced. I was discharged within the regular 48-hour period with no follow-up on my mental health care. Because of this. for a long time. I. like many women. existed in an unknown state. one that was relentlessly dismal and bleak. Too often. because women aren t taken seriously ― especially women of color ― we need to be our own advocates. (It shouldn t be this way but it is.)Some questions you can ask your doctor:What are the risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage?Having emerged somewhat intact. I am shaken and sobered by the devastating facts and numbers I ve learned about the preventable state of our maternal mortality rate. not only in developed countries but worldwide. I am so lucky to have been able to survive that day and to have eventually replaced the glowing operating room lights with the soft honey brown of my son s eyes.Too many women don t get that chance.Krystal A.

Biden plans to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take additional action to protect and expand access to medication abortion. protect access to contraception and ensure patients are able to obtain emergency medical care.The White House will formalize efforts by the Department of Justice to push back against any state efforts to limit the ability to travel out of state to get an abortion or access abortion medication.The order will also direct several federal agencies to better protect patient privacy amid concerns that digital information could put some women at risk in states that have already outlawed abortion following the Supreme Court s decision.

Nothing epitomizes market failures more than the cost of insulin.  Newsom said in a video announcing the project.  Many Americans experience out-of-pocket costs anywhere from $300 to $500 per month for this lifesaving drug. California is now taking matters into our own hands. The endeavor is included in the $308 billion state budget Newsom signed last week. In it. $100 million is set aside for insulin production contracts that will allow people with diabetes to obtain insulin  at a cheaper price. close to at-cost.  the governor said. Half of the funding will be spent on the development of low-cost insulin products and the other half will go toward an insulin manufacturing facility in California.

SAN JOSE. Calif. (AP) — A jury on Thursday convicted former Theranos executive Ramesh  Sunny  Balwani of collaborating with disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes in a massive fraud involving the blood-testing company that once enthralled Silicon Valley.The 12 jurors found Balwani guilty on all 12 felony counts of defrauding both Theranos investors and the patients who relied on wildly unreliable blood tests that could have jeopardized their health.Balwani sat impassively as the verdicts were read. blinking frequently.The outcome puts Balwani and Holmes in similar situations. Holmes was convicted on four counts of investor fraud and conspiracy earlier this year. During that trial. Holmes tearfully accused Balwani of sexually emotionally abusing her while they were lovers. An attorney for Balwani has vehemently denied those charges.Both Holmes. 38. and Balwani. 57. face up to 20 years in prison.Holmes is scheduled to be sentenced in late September. The date of Balwani s sentencing is expected to be set in the coming days.The dual convictions representing a resounding victory for federal prosecutors. who seized on the Theranos case as a rare opportunity to hold ambitious entrepreneurs accountable for engaging in technological hyperbole while pursuing fame and fortune. In the process. they hoped to discourage the practice of making bold and unproven promises about still-nascent products ― a startup strategy known as  fake it until you make it. After the verdicts were read and the jury was dismissed. Balwani walked over to his two brothers who were sitting behind him for what appeared to be a solemn discussion. The three sat quietly. heads bowed.While Holmes insinuated during her trial that Balwani manipulated her into making poor choices. Balwani s lawyers explicitly sought to shift all the blame for any misconduct squarely on Holmes.As part of Balwani s defense. the lawyers pointed out that Holmes was not only CEO. but also a Silicon Valley star who persuaded investors to pour nearly $1 billion into Theranos. Holmes boasted that her company had found a way to scan for hundreds of potential diseases with a device called the Edison that could test just a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick. Such technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare.But it turned out that the Edison never worked properly. providing faulty test results that Theranos conducted as part of a deal to set up mini labs in Walgreen s pharmacies. The flaws in Theranos  vaunted technology prompted Holmes and Balwani to shift their testing to conventional machines made by other vendors and while drawing vials of blood from patients  veins — a far cry from Holmes  promises.After committing about $15 million of his own money to bolster Theranos and then becoming the company s chief operating officer in 2010. Balwani eventually oversaw the blood-testing lab that was delivering the inaccurate results and supervised the Walgreen s deal.Unlike Holmes. who spent seven days on the witness stand during her trial. Balwani didn t testify in his own defense.Balwani s defense mirrored Holmes s in one key aspect: Both depicted the pair as tireless workers who believed so deeply in Theranos  technology that they never sold their respective stakes in the Palo Alto. California. company. At one point in 2014. Holmes  fortune was estimated at $4.5 billion while Balwani s Theranos holdings were valued at $500 million.But everything began to unravel in late 2015 after a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal exposed rampant problems with Theranos  technology. By May 2016. Holmes had dumped Balwani as her business and romantic partner. Holmes is now the mother of an infant son fathered by her current partner. Billy Evans. who was by her side through most of her trial.,Health News

Calls at 1 a.m. from the hospital are never easy. When you re in bed by 9 p.m. and up at 5 a.m. nearly every day. 1 a.m. hits at the exact wrong time. Years of always ensuring my ringer is on before I go to sleep have caused a near-Pavlovian response when it does actually ring. I answer the phone half-asleep. It s the middle of the night. and there is only one reason why someone is calling the hospital attorney: There s a crisis. and the providers don t know what to do.It could be any one of a thousand things.The police are in the emergency department demanding information about one of our patients. They are threatening our staff with jail if they fail to provide copies of medical records. They don t have a warrant or subpoena. Should we give them the records and likely violate the privacy law know as HIPAA. or is there another course of action?A parent is refusing psychiatric care for their 14-year-old. Is there a way to provide care over the parent s objections?A patient with a long-standing debilitating and terminal illness has intentionally harmed themselves. Who should make the decisions about their care and treatment?These calls are not solely  legal  in nature. Instead. they are a difficult blend of legal and ethical questions. Many questions arise from concerns about a patient s ability or inability to consent for care. More often than not. there is no clear or right answer. But we work with the physician to find a path forward after reviewing the facts of the situation.Our providers turn to attorneys because they are looking for a black-and-white answer to the problem they are facing. Occasionally. I get to tell them that there is. in fact. a law that is directly on point given the facts of the situation. But those situations are rare. We are working through gray. and when we do finally create an action plan. we are sometimes left with lingering questions about whether it was the right thing to do. morally. ethically and sometimes legally.I would never complain about this work. It is an honor and a privilege to help support our physicians and other providers through these difficult situations. It is clear to me that these are people who care deeply about the health and safety of their patients. They are doing the hard work of caring for their patients. and I want to be able to support them however I can.But hospital attorneys in Missouri and other states are facing a new kind of problem. It s a situation where health care ethics as well as medical standards of care tell physicians they should do one thing. but the law appears to be in conflict. I am talking about the complete ban on abortion in Missouri except in the case of  medical emergency. the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. WadeLet s take a look at the plain language of the statute. There are two definitions in Section 188.105 that we must be familiar with. First.  abortion  is defined as:(a) The act of using or prescribing any instrument. device. medicine. drug. or any other means or substance with the intent to destroy the life of an embryo or fetus in his or her mother s womb. orThe plain language makes it difficult to differentiate between (a) and (b). Next. look at  medical emergency :‘Medical Emergency  [is] a condition which. based on reasonable medical judgment. so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.There are two main issues with the law as written.The first is that there is no definition of  pregnancy  in the statute. It may seem silly. but there is no common agreement about when a pregnancy starts. There is language in other parts of the statute in which the legislature refers to life beginning at conception. but that language does not specifically tie to the definition of pregnancy that is necessary to interpret the abortion statute. So. does pregnancy start at conception? Does pregnancy start at implantation in the uterus? Should you define pregnancy the same way you would calculate gestational age (the first day of the last menstrual period)? This is important because if you are not  pregnant.  then there is no  abortion  under the statute.totalimmediatedeathirreversibleThere are a few things that are concerning about this definition. The first is the immediacy language. A plain-language reading would imply that it would need to occur  right now  in order to avert death. Does that mean that you cannot perform an abortion in a situation where a woman will experience death with no intervention. but. perhaps not right now? How do you prove that someone was close enough to death to warrant the abortion? How do you know. for sure. if a condition will cause irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function as opposed to a difficult. but temporary impairment?What about someone who is high-risk for death by virtue of being pregnant? Are they required to carry the baby until they experience the predicted life-threatening complication? Since there is no exception for rape or incest. this is a very important question when you are talking about very young girls (9-14) becoming pregnant. It is also an important question for patients with chronic medical conditions that will be exacerbated by a pregnancy.The focus on the  death  of the woman and not just health further complicates this analysis. In addition. not being permitted to remove a  dying  fetus. which was permitted under the law and then removed a few years back. makes this provision even more narrow.This lack of clarity even led one Missouri health system to pull emergency contraception from their sexual assault kits. I am also hearing of delays in treating ectopic pregnancies.Every time an abortion is performed in a Missouri facility. the provider is required to submit a Report of Induced Termination of Pregnancy to the state. The information in the report is ostensibly used for public health purposes. However. the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is clear that the reports can be used for other purposes.My expectation is that these reports will be reviewed for potential prosecution. Under the Missouri statute. the physician must offer an affirmative defense in order to prove that the termination of pregnancy was. indeed. a medical emergency. That is. the statute shifts the burden for criminal prosecution from  innocent until proven guilty.  to  guilty until proven innocent. an informal statementIt is no wonder that hospital attorneys are getting calls to help physicians work through these laws. And while the focus of this article is on the impact to physicians. the real victims are the patients. You do not go to an acute care hospital for the purpose of seeking an abortion for convenience. You get to the hospital because something is wrong. Either the patient has an underlying condition that is causing complications. or there is simply something wrong with the pregnancy. Our patients are wives. mothers. sisters and co-workers who are dealing with tremendously difficult situations. Their lives can be risked by delaying lifesaving care.Even with all of these questions lingering. Missouri does not have the worst laws in the country. There is at least a medical emergency exception that there is some flexibility to interpret. There is also not an explicit ban on drugs that may be abortifacients. but which are the standard of care for some chronic conditions. That means that. unlike in some other states. women are still able to access the medications they need to treat their chronic conditions.For my own part. I have been willing to endure  reasonable  limitations on access to abortive care. However. I am now convinced that government is incapable of drafting legislation that can fairly cover all of the nuances of human reproduction. Any time it ventures to ban abortion. there are severe consequences to women and their families.I will not support candidates who believe their place is with me. in my doctor s office.I will not support candidates who believe the most important thing for the government to do is to control the lives and livelihoods of people who can bear children.We are in a time of great political flux. I encourage anyone who cares about access to health care to engage in the political process. Kansas is the first state that will have the opportunity to vote to protect access to abortive care in the future. During the Aug. 2 primary. Kansas voters will be presented with a constitutional amendment. While the amendment would take no specific action on abortion. its purpose is to allow the legislature to enact whatever laws it sees fit related to abortion. even in cases of rape or incest. There is already a total abortion ban ready to be introduced by the legislature in the event the amendment passes. I encourage Kansas voters to vote  no  on the proposed amendment.Because. in the end. an abortion ban is government intervention into the most private and significant portions of our lives. Once given this power. there is nothing to stop legislators from controlling our bodies in countless and untold ways.Note: The author is a hospital-based health care regulatory attorney in Missouri.

OTTAWA (AP) — Canada is going to throw out about 13.6 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine because it couldn t find any takers for it either at home or abroad.Canada signed a contract with AstraZeneca in 2020 to get 20 million doses of its vaccine. and 2.3 million Canadians received at least one dose of it. mostly between March and June 2021.Following concerns in the spring of 2021 about rare but potentially fatal blood clots from AstraZeneca. Canada focused on using its ample supplies of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.In July 2021. Canada promised to donate the rest of its procured supply. about 17.7 million doses. But in a statement Tuesday. Health Canada said that despite efforts to meet that pledge. 13.6 million doses have expired and will have to be thrown out.``Due to limited demand for the vaccine and recipient country challenges with distribution and absorption. they were not accepted.″ the statement said.In all. Canada donated 8.9 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine — 4.8 millon doses from its main supply and 4.1 million doses that it bought from the COVAX vaccine-sharing program.About 85% of Canadians are considered fully vaccinated. compared with 61% of the world s population. and just 16% of people living in the world s poorest countries.,Health News
generallyThis is not only perfectly normal. it s totally acceptable. The notion that you should force yourself into tough workouts creates an unsustainable and poor relationship with exercise.I ve personally fallen victim to it: Many days. I ve been consumed with guilt or shame because I didn t commit to a workout I originally planned to do. or I didn t perform as well as I assumed I would.Despite what you see on Instagram. fitness pros often feel the same way. So how do they honor this feeling and navigate it when it happens?Read on for some of their best advice on how to keep up a routine while staying kind to your body and mind.Kenny SantucciRecovery is vital in any fitness routine. For Santucci. some recovery days may include him trying to  walk. ride a bike. or do something that keeps me moving a little bit.  he said. noting that movement always gets him out of a mental funk.For other people. recovery might mean taking a break altogether ― and that s OK. It s all about listening to your body and not pushing yourself to a point where you end up hating exercise.previously told HuffPostWhat you may have been able to conquer yesterday may not be the same today. In the same vein. your capacity to work out in your 30s is certainly going to be different in another decade.Don t be hard on yourself because a  previous  version of you could have done it. Your fitness is going to change. The way you take care of your body is going to change from the time that you re 20 to the time that you re 80.  Kendall Toole. a Peloton instructor and mental health advocate. told HuffPost in May.  You will always have to take care of your fitness. but the way you move your body will change.

Hannah Corbin. a Peloton instructor. told HuffPost in an interview in March.Putting on some tunes that not only hype you up but encourage you to dance can get you in a good headspace and help loosen you up before working out.You re not gonna hit a personal record in every workout ― especially on the days where you re just not mentally there. That s OK. Just keep it simple. If I m doing a bench press. for example. I start on the bench with just the bar and then I ll slowly start to increase the intensity with weights.  Santucci said.  I can t give 100% every day. so on the days I don t feel great I ll just take it a little bit easier. Corbin said she always prioritizes stretching and foam rolling. noting that it consistently makes her feel good each day.  I will often use a foam roller and activate my glutes so I can feel really strong and grounded instead of feeling achy and like I m dragging my feet.  she said.figure four or hip stretchesNoah NeimanRumble Boxing and Rumble Training If I only have a few minutes to train. my go-to is to jump rope and box.  Neiman told HuffPost in a 2021 interview.  I believe in the therapeutic [power] of fight training so much ... knuckle therapy I call it. Spend some time discovering fun workouts that don t feel like. well. work to you. That might mean dancing around your living room with some good music. hula hooping or doing a themed spin class. Finding joy in exercise is essential. Do you remember learning about inertia in middle school science? Stay with me here. I think about it all the time. The act of continuing to be in a state of rest. or uniform straight motion until impacted by an opposing force.  Lemere said. If I don t feel like getting to the gym and skip a day instead of executing a planned training session. I am breaking my momentum.  she continued.  The act of restarting is most often more challenging than the workout itself. On days when I m not really feeling it. I don t pressure myself to have the best workout. I encourage myself to move for the sake of consistency. so the next workout is that much easier. ,Health News
PORTLAND. Maine (AP) — An unusual number of seals are becoming stranded and dying off Maine this summer. and avian influenza is to blame. the federal government said Tuesday.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed that samples from four Maine seals tested positive for the virus. The animals all died or required euthanasia. the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.Marine mammal rescuers started to notice an unusually high number of seal strandings in June. and then the USDA conducted the tests. NOAA said in a statement. The rate of dead seal strandings in Maine is about three times the normal rate for the summer and is close to 60. the agency said.deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeysIt s not the first instance of bird flu jumping to marine mammals such as seals. but the federal government is monitoring the deaths closely nonetheless. said Allison Ferreira. a NOAA spokesperson. There is a national outbreak of avian flu happening. so that was the cause of concern for these animals.  Ferreira said.Most of the seals that have been founded stranded in Maine this summer have been dead. NOAA said. The dead seals have included gray seals and harbor seals.The health risk  posed by avian flu to the general public is low. however. precautions are recommended.  NOAA s statement said. The agency said people and pets should never approach seals. and should contact authorities if they find an animal they believe is stranded.sounded the alarm about a possible bird flu outbreak.The source of the outbreak among seals is still being investigated.Marine Mammals of Maine. a rescue organization. that it has responded to 40 stranded seals since June 1. Katy Green. a spokesperson for the organization. said it is  aware of this evolving situation  and working with NOAA on it.Gray seals and harbor seals are abundant off New England. where they are beloved by wildlife watchers and sometimes bemoaned by fishermen. However. the bird flu deaths don t represent the first time they ve died off at an alarming rate.NOAA declared an  unusual mortality event  for the seals after more than 2.700 of them stranded off Maine. New Hampshire and Massachusetts from July 2018 to March 2020. Feds attributed those deaths to phocine distemper virus. That virus does not impact humans.,Health News
This excerpt is adapted from  Knocked Down: A High-Risk Memoir. I was four months pregnant and walking around Manhattan with my new husband when I felt an unusual pain in my lower belly. The next day. an emergency sonogram showed I had three huge fibroids growing in my uterus right alongside the baby. and one of them was pressing on my cervix. When the doctor told me to go to bed and stay there for the next five months. I had no idea what I was about to give up. I lost my job. my finances suffered. and my marriage began to crumble. I spiraled into a mental health crisis. but no one was paying attention. On the way home from seeing the specialist the beautiful May afternoon in which I was told my baby might not make to 24 weeks. my husband. Chris. and I stopped at a diner to pick up grilled cheese sandwiches. I reclined the seat of our old Honda as much as I could to take pressure off my lower belly. The pain was becoming more severe by the hour. like a stack of bricks bearing down on my cervix. Once home. we ate the sandwiches on our deck overlooking the Shawangunk Ridge in New York s Hudson Valley. There was no doubt about it. we had a million-dollar view. but the beauty only amplified my grief. There should have been clouds and thunder. a little wind maybe. even some garbage strewn about. The sky should have opened up and unleashed golf ball-sized hail on the world. But there was none of that. not even the smallest breeze to juxtapose my stirring uncertainty. and so with no other choice. I chewed in silence. Chris finished up the scraps of his lunch.  I have to go now and take care of a few things.  He kissed me hard on the head. leaving me on the deck to head back to work. When I heard his car pull out of the driveway. I wandered over to the bed. laughing quietly at the idea that a grilled cheese sandwich was my last meal of freedom. I stood there. holding the sheets aside. I put my knee up on the edge. about to climb in. I hesitated. What would it mean for me to get into this bed right now?  For five months?  I whispered. but the words caught in my throat. Sometimes there is simply no pill or procedure. or anything else. Sometimes it s just you. and whatever or whomever you believe in. trying to figure out how to get through the next moment. I had a hard time coming to terms with the idea that we couldn t just fix this. That I couldn t just fix this. What if I just didn t do it? Would I really lose the baby? What was I willing to risk? I could ignore the doctor s advice. Would I be judged for not agreeing to become a stationary vessel for this child? Probably. The real question was: How much did I care? I needed more information. I did what almost any other woman would do in my situation: I dropped the sheets in a crumple on the bed. went over to my desk and Googled  bed rest. Turns out information around the pros and cons is gravely lacking. and most research is inconclusive. Some experts go so far as to say that bed rest is unethical. What I did find out is that almost 1 million pregnant women each year are labeled high-risk in the United States. My jaw dropped. I found that statistics vary. but at minimum 70% of those women end up on bed rest for various reasons. including bleeding. gestational diabetes. preeclampsia. carrying multiples ... the list is endless. That s at least 700.000 women a year suffering from complications that force them to check out of life as they know it. lie down and wait. Those are high numbers. and behind those statistics are real women spending their daylight hours in a horizontal position for less than tantalizing reasons. I was left with one question: Was bed rest beneficial. or would it just make me physically and emotionally weaker? The only answer I could come up with was: maybe. Maybe bed rest helps. maybe not. Super. Hundreds of thousands of women a year are on bed rest. and only a handful of scientists think it s worthy enough to study this? If you really want to cheer yourself up. Google  stupid scientific studies  to see where we are focusing our resources instead. One such fact-finding mission makes it official that Spider-Man doesn t really exist. But all those needy bed-resting women? Who cares. It s not like they re superheroes.The research I did find suggested that most women are put on bed rest to stabilize their bodies. Otherwise normal activities — carrying groceries. exercising or going to work ― cause additional strain in an already fragile situation. There are also very real benefits to lying down. For example. it increases the blood flow to the placenta and thus can slightly increase the baby s birth weight. But other studies show that bed rest can be hard on a woman s health. A woman s heart and lungs don t work as well as when she s on the move. making her susceptible to blood clots. It can also take a long time to recover lost muscle mass from being in bed for so long. In other words. these studies are saying that not only does bed rest maybe not work. but it can also actually make things worse. My own personal conclusion: This was a waiting game to see if I would miscarry or make it to the finish line. I had been thrust into a race that I had not signed up for. I closed my laptop. Now here I was. faced with the opportunity to literally nurture a new life growing inside me even though it would mean giving up my mobility and. with it. my independence. I walked over to the bed and pulled back the sheets. not out of some sense of courage or determination. but out of ambivalence. I never stuck with anything that made me uncomfortable. Commitment issues? Perhaps. Would this be any different? Those first few days. Chris marveled at my perseverance. telling everyone how I hopped right into bed and didn t get up. It may have looked like that to the rest of the world. this unsung bed-resting warrior. fighting to keep my baby alive. giving up my free will. but I could never have predicted the toll it was about to take on my life and the years I would spend processing the trauma and healing from those five months in bed.No one talks about the long-term effects a high-risk pregnancy has on a woman and her family. and many are left struggling without support. With the recent reversal of Roe v. Wade. now more than ever. we need to bring these issues to the forefront. advocate for our health and our bodies. and make our voices heard.

CHARLESTON. W.Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co.. Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases. they must be decided not based on sympathy. but on the facts and the law.  U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling.  In view of the court s findings and conclusions. the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants  favor. Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a  tsunami  of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants  conduct was unreasonable. reckless and disregarded the public s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance. Faber said West Virginia s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids  is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance. Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act. he said. Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants.  Faber wrote.In a statement. Cardinal Health said the judge s ruling  recognizes what we demonstrated in court. which is that we do not manufacture. market. or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions. As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain. we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were  deeply disappointed  in the ruling. We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements. company documents. and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside. our appreciation goes out to the first responders. public officials. treatment professionals. researchers. and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was  a blow to our city and community. but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity. The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again. The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses. overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.Last year in Cabell County. an Ohio River county of 93.000 residents. there were 1.067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year. suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits. according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources  Office of Drug Control Policy.The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100.000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements. including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc.. AbbVie s Allergan and their family of companies.In all. more than 3.000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments. Native American tribes. unions. hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers. distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that s been linked to the deaths of 500.000 Americans over the past two decades.In separate. similar lawsuits. the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019. and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.,Health News
Pope Francis is speaking out against abortion again amid the controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.During an interview with Reuters published Monday. Francis said he respected the court s decision but could not say whether it was correct  from a judicial point of view.   I tell you the truth. I don t understand it from a technical point of view.  he said. adding.  I have to study it because I don t really understand (the details of) the ruling 50 years ago and now I can t say whether it did right or wrong from a judicial point of view.  The high court struck down Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey last month. ending decades-old legal precedent that protected abortion rights.Francis also said it is important to observe what science has learned about abortions in the past few decades.  In this we have to be scientific. see what science tells us today. Science today and any book on embryology. the one our medical students study. tells you that 30 days after conception there is DNA and the laying out already of all the organs.  he said.do not realizeto form I ask: ‘Is it licit. is it right. to eliminate a human life to resolve a problem?   Francis asked in his Reuters interview.  It s a human life - that s science. The moral question is whether it is right to take a human life to solve a problem. Indeed. is it right to hire a hit man to solve a problem? During a Vatican-sponsored anti-abortion conference in May 2019. the pope similarly asked:  Is it licit to throw away a life to resolve a problem? Is it licit to hire a hit man to resolve a problem?  He also claimed that a human being is  never incompatible with life. In fact. fetal deaths can happen anytime due to problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. infections. birth defects. genetic abnormalities and more.At the time. Francis said he couldn t condone abortion even when a fetus is critically ill or likely to die. and implored doctors and priests to support families in carrying such pregnancies to term.This month. the pope dismissed reports that he plans to resign as the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. ,Health News

mysterious listeria outbreakCDC said Big Olaf CreameryreportedThe ice cream is only sold in Florida. and Big Olaf Creamery voluntarily began contacting retail locations to recommend they stop selling its products.Health officials advised anyone who has the products at home to throw them away and to clean any items that may have touched them.saidFacebookThe agency first said Thursday it was searching for the source of a spate of illnesses linked to the potentially deadly bacteria. saying 23 people had been sickened who either lived in or had recently traveled to Florida. CDC investigators appealed to the public to help figure out what might be causing the cases of listeriosis.Listeria can be deadly. causing fever. vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms generally start within two weeks of eating contaminated food (although they can take months to appear). and pregnant women. older adults and those with compromised immune systems are at particular risk of severe illness. The one death linked to the outbreak was reported in Illinois. and the CDC said there were five pregnant women who were sickened. One of those illnesses resulted in a fetal loss. the agency said.Investigators added that the true number of cases linked to the latest outbreak was likely far higher as some people can recover without medical care.,Health News
Why did I ever agree to do this?I was in my forties and had been taking hormones that my OB/GYN prescribed for hot flashes. After a year. he suggested I switch to a newer medication. which I did. but almost immediately I developed vaginal bleeding. It s important to note that my doctor was worried about ovarian cancer. and had he been right. he could have saved my life. But he wasn t. The surgery found no cancer. I went back on my old hormones and the bleeding stopped.I m still ashamed that I didn t listen to my instincts.I had several options short of surgery that I could have pursued first but didn t. I could have switched back to my former medication to see if the bleeding stopped. I could have done my own research on the new drug so I could at least present the doctor with some research-based evidence. not just my strong belief. I also could have gone for a second opinion.I ve since spoken to more than 40 women about my experience. and listening to their stories. I ve discovered that I m not alone in shortchanging myself regarding a medical decision. I ve learned that there are many ways women can inadvertently undermine themselves when it comes to their health. Some. like me. simply take too passive a role with their doctors. perhaps from a culturized reluctance to challenge authority. Others blame themselves for getting sick in the first place. One woman expressed that she was convinced she got lupus as payback for having been mean-spirited as a child. Some women wait too long to get to the doctor. letting other responsibilities — children. work. ailing parents — take precedence.One woman I met delayed her mammogram because she had no one to take care of her son. A few months later. she finally was able to reschedule. and now she has stage three breast cancer and is facing a long. difficult recovery.May was Women s Health Month. but there s never a bad time to explore how women can remove the personal barriers that prevent them from seeking the best possible healthcare. There s also never a bad time to discuss another huge component of women s healthcare issues: The gender bias that still persists in the medical community.These gendered attitudes don t develop in a vacuum. There is a fraught history of centuries of women s bodies mocked. minimized. disparaged. or even ignored.Caroline Criado PerezComplaints & DisordersFeminine ForeverAnd while the specifics today are more subtle than they were in the past. the tradition of dismissiveness toward women hasn t elapsed completely.Years ago I had a biopsy for a lump on my back. After it was completed. I asked the doctor what my next step would be if the biopsy turned out to be malignant.As he turned to walk out the door without answering. he said.  Why don t you leave the driving to us! But when my husband stepped in and asked the same question. the doctor explained I would need to come back so they could be sure they  got it all. At 18. one of my daughters was diagnosed with TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder). a jaw disorder in which chewing becomes quite painful. At the time. the recommended treatment was removing the disc in the jaw and replacing it with one made of Teflon.But the treatment carried a major risk: It was possible that during the surgery. one or more of the facial nerves could be nicked. which can cause partial paralysis of the face. Since the ramifications were so terrifying. we decided to find out if there were other options.It turned out there were two camps in the TMJ community. One was 100% for surgery ― the other. 100% against it. There seemed to be no middle ground.One doctor advocating for the surgery told me.  If you don t allow your daughter to have surgery. I strongly suggest you go for psychological therapy. You really need to examine your unconscious hostility toward your daughter. Another expert in the nonsurgical camp told me.  If it were my daughter. I would just wait and see. Mothers who rush their children into surgery need to examine their motives. Our children don t need to be perfect. Though my husband was present at both appointments. those comments were directed toward me.She did not have the surgery. Luckily. that was the right choice. The Teflon implant apparently caused a severe reaction associated with bone destruction. pain. and in some cases. severe facial disfigurement. It has since been withdrawn from the market.2018 review of scores of studies Fortunately. this unhappy situation of bias and dismissal may finally be starting to change.Comedian Amy Schumer has spoken openly about her endometriosis (a painful disease where tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside it) and her trichotillomania (a hair-pulling disorder).

Dr. Elaine Kungnever sought to be  TikTok famous.  Instead. the board-certified dermatologist s foray into social media began when a patient came to her with an itchy scalp ― a simple enough complaint. Because the patient was a regular. Kung knew her common skin concerns. But that day. something wasn t normal. The woman s entire scalp and hair were oily. and pimples covered her face. I looked at her. and I m like. ‘What s going on?   Kung said.The patient told Kung about a recent change to her skin care routine. She d heard that washing her hair every day wasn t good for the scalp or hair. and that instead. she should use olive oil. She d gotten the advice from a TikTok influencer. I said. ‘That s why you re itching.   Kung recalled.  You re not washing sweat. hair grease and air pollutants away. You re trapping all of that in with olive oil. And the olive oil is getting on your face. and you re getting pimples. Kung s medical assistant asked the patient about the influencer. Who was this person? What did they base these claims upon? Did they have any medical background? Any experience in the skin care industry? And the young woman said. ‘No ... but she has a million followers on TikTok!   Scenarios like this are becoming more and more common. Patients are taking skin care advice not from professionals or people with expertise. but from popular social media creators on their screens.Some content creators are able to generate a full-time income from their love of skin care. showing off different products. educating viewers about common ingredients and promoting various brands through sponsorship deals.But the boom in skin care information on platforms like Instagram. YouTube and TikTok has proven a double-edged sword for professionals.  From a medical standpoint. it is great to have patients who have researched treatments and conditions.  said Dr. Beth Goldstein. a board-certified dermatologist and president of the Central Dermatology Center in North Carolina.  But it can take a bit of time to rectify misinformation.  Sometimes misinformation is unintentionally communicated to users because of the visual nature of video. When you look at these influencers. and they are demonstrating product use. they re pumping and pumping and pumping. so you see big globs of cream or big globs of cleanser.  Kung explained.  Your face is just like the size of your hand ... You don t have to pump so much.  But a tiny amount of moisturizer doesn t show up as well on camera. which is bad for influencers. Their main objective is to make their videos as visually pleasing as possible to capture viewers  attention.The vast number of products showcased and sponsored on influencers  channels. reels and pages can also encourage viewers to buy more products than they truly need. I ve had some people tell me that they had never used so many skin products in their life. but their skin is not getting better.  Kung said.She recalls one patient who had six steps in both her morning and nightly skin care routines in an effort to use up all the products she d bought on the recommendation of influencers.  So now she has a bunch of stuff that she feels obligated to use and not waste. She even astutely recognized that ‘sometimes if I skip a step. it doesn t mean that my skin got any worse.   However. other times. misinformation can take the form of dangerous fads ― like  SPF contouring  and self-administered injectable trends. These influencers. they don t have a medical background.  said Mina-Jacqueline Au. an esthetician and founder and CEO of Vivre SkinLabs.  They don t know the consequences ... They are doing things because they need to go viral. That s their goal. To combat misinformation. many skin care professionals have had to hire social media managers to broadcast the facts on their own accounts. And that s not exactly the best use of their time. It is a call for us to continue to be on social media platforms in inefficient ways and in significant numbers to educate. help dispel myths and misinformation.  Goldstein said. Many skin care professionals find themselves in an uphill battle. Even social media influencers struggle to learn the platforms  ever-changing algorithms and get attention from followers. and that s their full-time job. So for dermatologists and estheticians. particularly those in smaller practices who cannot afford social media managers. combating misinformation online isn t something they have time for. Any 15- to 30-second video I do is actually two hours of work.  Kung said.  Not only to record and edit ― I have to caption [the videos] and post on three platforms.  Sometimes it s kind of sad.  she said.  I do all this work. but I only have. like. 2.000-something followers on Instagram and 8.000-something followers on TikTok. That is so small compared to having a reach of 1 million people. The problem is. we re not professional entertainers or info-tainers. Most of the people who watch my videos don t watch for more than two to four seconds. So how do you teach in two to four seconds? With entertaining visuals. an inviting  best friend  personality and accessibility from the comfort of your phone. it s easy to see why social media influencers have such an outsize voice when it comes to skin care. Platform algorithms can curate feeds that reinforce the same information repeatedly. leading to the spread of even more misinformation. I encourage people to look also at information from multiple sources that don t necessarily come across your social media platform of choice.  Goldstein said.  Look as best you can for credibility in the source of any information. Skin care experts also urge people to use their critical thinking skills. Evaluate who is making the claim. and what their intentions may be. When in doubt. check in with a specialist. We are the people that not only know more about skin. but also the consequences of not doing the right thing.  Au said.  At the end of the day. we always ask ourselves. what is the end goal? And none of these [influencers ] end goals are for the health of your skin.  ,Health News

outbreak of listeriaAlmost all of the 23 people sickened either live in Florida or have traveled to the state in the month before they became ill. but investigators have yet to determine what food may have spread the bacteria over a span of 18 months.Listeria is a potentially deadly form of bacteria that can cause fever. vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms generally start within two weeks of eating contaminated food. and illnesses can be severe for pregnant women. older adults and those with compromised immune systems. Cases can be treated with antibiotics.The one death was reported in Illinois. and the CDC noted five people were sickened while pregnant. One illness resulted in a fetal loss. the agency said. A specific food item has not yet been identified as the source of this outbreak.  the CDC said. noting the illnesses started on dates ranging from Jan. 24. 2021. through June 12. 2022.  Most of the sick people in this outbreak live in or traveled to Florida about a month before they got sick. The CDC added the true number of sick people is likely higher than the number reported as some people recover without medical care. It also takes three to four weeks to link an illness to an outbreak. so recent cases of listeriosis may not be reported in the data.The agency has asked the public to help investigators determine the source of the outbreak. asking those with symptoms of listeria to write down as much as they can remember about what they ve eaten in the month before they got sick.can be found in contaminated foods ,Health News

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 together made up the majority of U.S. COVID cases last week. while a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts recommended fall booster shots tweaked to target omicron variants.according to the CDCmet Tuesday Dr. Peter Marks. the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA. told the committee the U.S. is expected to face a challenge this fall. with half of Americans vaccinated with only two vaccine doses and immunity declining in the population.  That combination of waning immunity combined with the potential emergence of novel variants during a time this winter when we will move inside as a population increases our risk of a major COVID-19 outbreak.  Marks said. For that reason. we have to give serious consideration to a booster campaign this fall to help protect us.  Marks continued.Marks said vaccines that match the evolving virus give the best protection against deaths and hospitalizations. The better the match of the vaccine with the circulating strain we believe may correspond to improved vaccine effectiveness and potentially to a better durability of protection.  Marks said.Members voted 19-2 in favor of recommending COVID boosters that target omicron. While the vote is not binding. the FDA usually accepts recommendations from its advisers. This doesn t mean that we are saying that there will be boosters recommended for everyone in the fall. but my belief is that this gives us the right vaccine in preparation for potential need for boosters in the fall.  Dr. Amanda Cohn said following the vote.Dr. Ofer Levy. another member of the panel. noted that fall is only a few months away. We face a time-sensitive decision. If we re going to have something better in the fall the decision has to be made very soon and so I believe it was more likely than not the benefit outweighed the risk of including an omicron component.  Levy said.according to The New York TimesModerna and Pfizer have been working on boosters that combine the original shot with the omicron variant. but not those subvariants.according to The Associated Pressannounced Saturdaythe CDC recommended COVID vaccines for children under the age of 5found nearly 20 million lives were saved by COVID vaccines ,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — Reacting to a surprising and growing monkeypox outbreak. U.S. health officials on Tuesday expanded the group of people recommended to get vaccinated against the monkeypox virus.They also said they are providing more monkeypox vaccine. working to expand testing. and taking other steps to try to get ahead of the outbreak. We will continue to take aggressive action against this virus.  said Dr. Ashish Jha. White House COVID-19 response coordinator. who has also been playing a role in how the government deals with monkeypox.The administration said it was expanding the pool of people who are advised to get vaccinated to include those who may realize on their own that they could have been infected. That includes men who who have recently had sex with men at parties or in other gatherings in cities where monkeypox cases have been identified.Most monkeypox patients experience only fever. body aches. chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.The disease is endemic in parts of Africa. where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. It does not usually spread easily among people.Last month. cases began emerging in Europe and the United States. Many — but not all — of those who contracted the virus had traveled internationally. Most were men who have sex with men. but health officials stress that anyone can get monkeypox.Case counts have continued to grow. As of Tuesday. the U.S. had identified 306 cases in 27 states and the District of Columbia. More than 4.700 cases have been found in more than 40 other countries outside the areas of Africa where the virus is endemic.There have been no U.S. deaths and officials say the risk to the American public is low. But they are taking steps to assure people that medical measures are in place to deal with the growing problem.One of the steps was to expand who is recommended to get vaccinated. Vaccines customarily are given to build immunity in people before they are ever infected. But if given within days or even a few weeks of first becoming infected. some vaccines can reduce severity of symptoms.A two-dose vaccine. Jynneos. is approved for monkeypox in the U.S. The government has many more doses of an older smallpox vaccine — ACAM2000 — that they say could also be used. but that vaccine is considered to have a greater risk of side effects and is not recommended for people who have HIV. So it s the Jynneos vaccine that officials have been trying to use as a primary weapon against the monkeypox outbreak.So far. the government has deployed over 9.000 doses of vaccine. U.S. officials on Tuesday said said they are increasing the amount of Jynneos vaccine they are making available. allocating 56.000 doses immediately and about 240.000 more over the coming weeks. They promised more than 1 million more over the coming months.Officials said limited Jynneos doses will be allocated  using a four-tier distribution strategy that prioritizes jurisdictions with the highest case rates of monkeypox.  and that the number of doses distributed would be based on the number of people at risk for monkeypox and on how many of them can t get ACAM2000 because of HIV.That suggests the largest number of doses might go to states like New York. California and Illinois. each of which has reported more than 40 cases. However. officials on Tuesday did not say exactly which jurisdictions would be at the top of the list.David Harvey. executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. was critical of the government s announcement. .We have more questions than ever about how this vaccine will make it to those most at-risk in an equitable way and how the U.S. will ramp up testing and provide access to the best therapeutics.  Harvey said. in a statement.Another change announced Tuesday: Until now. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that vaccines be given after exposure to people whom health officials identify as close personal contacts of cases. But on Tuesday. CDC officials say they are expanding the recommendation to people who were never identified but may realize on their own that they may have been infected.That can include men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading. It s almost like we re expanding the definition of who a contact might be.  said the CDC s Jennifer McQuiston. If people have been to a party or other place where monkeypox has been known to spread  we recommend they come in for a vaccine.  she said.The CDC s expansion follows similar steps taken in New York City and the District of Columbia.The District of Columbia has identified 19 cases. but case-tracking investigations revealed that some of the infected men had been in gatherings where they were hugging. kissing or in other forms of close intimate contact with people they didn t know. said Anil Mangla of the D.C. health department.It was clear that  we were missing something here.  and needed to start offering services to others. said Mangla. an epidemiologist.Last Thursday. New York City s health department — armed with 1.000 of doses of Jynneos from the federal government — announced it was opening a temporary clinic to offer the vaccine to all gay. bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the previous two weeks.But all the appointments quickly filled up that day. and the last round of appointments was Monday.  Until we receive more supply we are unable to release additional vaccination appointments.  said Patrick Gallahue. a spokesman for the city s health department. in an email.On Monday. the District of Columbia s health department took a similar step. The department started taking appointments at 1 p.m. Monday but had to stop after 20 minutes. Mangla said.The department only had 200 doses of Jynneos. and it was clear at the point that it the department didn t have the vaccine supply or staffing to continue to sign up new people. he said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A resolution calling on police and prosecutors in New Orleans to make investigations and prosecutions of abortions  the lowest priority for enforcement  was introduced Tuesday by three New Orleans City Council members.The resolution by council members Helena Moreno. Lesli Harris and J.P. Morrell is directed at city departments including the sheriff and the district attorney. It calls on abortion cases to be given priority only when a woman has been coerced or forced into an abortion. when negligent conduct threatens a woman s health or when an abortion is involved in the investigation of another crime.It also lists purposes for which city funds should not be spent. including surveillance or investigations of people or organizations to determine whether an abortion has occurred.A council news release says the resolution will be considered July 7. It follows Friday s Supreme Court decision allowing states to outlaw abortion. District Attorney Jason Williams has said he  will not shift priorities  from prosecuting violent crime to abortion.Louisiana law has  trigger  provisions that were written to outlaw most abortions once the high court reversed the Roe v. Wade decision that established abortion rights. A state district judge in New Orleans blocked enforcement pending a July hearing.,Health News
Roe v. Wade. the landmark Supreme Court case legalizing abortion. has been overturned. and we are grappling with the profound loss of bodily autonomy and personhood that was stolen.As a family medicine doctor with a focus on reproductive health. including abortion care. I have been fighting against this outcome for years. and I ve already seen a steadily increasing stream of patients who have needed to fly for compassionate abortion care. I m lucky to live and work in New York. where Gov. Kathy Hochul recently signed several laws further codifying and protecting abortion access. Connecticut was the first to pass similar protections. and states like California and Massachusetts are working on legislation. But this is a stark contrast to what Americans in other parts of the country are facing. even though access to high-quality. evidence-based health care should not be based on where you live.So let s explore what s coming next. thanks to the fall of Roe: worsening health care disparities. higher maternal mortality rates. criminalization of pregnant people and their doctors. lack of medical care for people experiencing pregnancy complications. attacks on routine medical care for people who can become pregnant. and broad assaults on human rights currently in place for marginalized groups.To start. it s important to understand that millions of Americans have already been living in a post-Roe reality. States led by anti-abortion politicians have spent decades making abortion access nearly impossible through targeted regulations of abortion providers. or TRAP laws. They have forced people to drive hours to get care. followed by a visit where doctors are legally obligated to deliver medically inaccurate information. After jumping through those hoops. many states require 24- to 72-hour waiting periods before patients can return to finally get the abortion they need.It s easy to see how these barriers are lengthy and expensive. However. lawmakers pretend these obstacles haven t represented an  undue burden  Before Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization overturned Roe. seven states had two or fewer abortion clinics left due to the onslaught of TRAP laws.We have already been operating in a system where people with wealth and power are able to end unwanted pregnancies. while marginalized groups. including Black people. Indigenous people. people of color. immigrants. LGBTQ people. children. and people with disabilities. have suffered and will continue to suffer the most due to harsh abortion restrictions. If you are new to abortion advocacy. I encourage you to look to long-standing reproductive justice and advocacy groups ― including SisterSong. the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. New Voices for Reproductive Justice. the Afiya Centerand Shout Your Abortion. among others ― and follow their guidance.In 2022 alone. the Supreme Court s decision will directly cause the deaths of hundreds of people as their bodies are used by the state against their will. Abortion is significantly safer than pregnancy ― period. The World Health Organization ranks the United States 57th in the world for maternal mortality. This rate has increased in past decades. unlike the decline seen in most of the rest of the world. In 2020. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. at 23.8 deaths per 100.000 births. Non-Hispanic Black women fared much worse. with a staggering 55.3 deaths per 100.000 births. making them 3.5 times as likely to die as non-Hispanic white women. For comparison. the death rate from abortion in the U.S. between 2013 and 2018 (the most recent data available) was 0.41 per 100.000 abortions ― which means abortion is 25 times safer than continuing pregnancy.The politicians banning abortion falsely claim they are protecting women. while having the worst maternal outcomes in the nation. In order. the states with the highest maternal mortality rates are Louisiana. Georgia. Indiana. New Jersey. Arkansas. Alabama. Missouri. Texas. South Carolina and Arizona. Notice a pattern? They mandate forced birth. but don t have adequate prenatal care. Sen. Bill Cassidy actually argued that maternal mortality rates in his state aren t so bad if you don t count Black women. Sorry. Bill. we do count Black women.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. with other medical organizations. said in a statement that the Dobbs decision will  certainly lead to unnecessary patient suffering and harm.  The Lancet. one of the world s most prestigious medical journals. went further saying:  Women will die ... [Supreme Court Justice Samuel] Alito and his supporters will have women s blood on their hands.  The American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Medical Association have also condemned anti-abortion laws. This is not theoretical: These are living. breathing people whose deaths will be an incalculable loss.Many of the pro-abortion rallying cries over the past few months have centered the idea that only safe abortion can be outlawed. While it s certainly true that abortion will continue. this sentiment is not entirely correct. We are not returning to the pre-Roe era of coat-hanger and back-alley abortions. Today we have medication abortion. a highly effective and safe combination of mifepristone and misoprostol that has been used legally in the U.S. since 2000. and which received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2021 to be mailed via telemed. The pills can be ordered online and delivered to all 50 states through international organizations like Aid Access.Abortion is not as divisive as hard-line opponents want us to believe. According to the Pew Research Center. 61% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. while only 37% believe it should be illegal in all or most cases. Extreme abortion bans are unpopular. but many of the anti-abortion laws being passed are exceptionally cruel. Twelve states have enacted laws making no exception for pregnancy due to rape or incest. and three states don t even make an exception to save the pregnant person s life.We are never going back. Instead. we are moving toward a darker future of increased legal surveillance and criminalization of all people who can become pregnant. regardless of their feelings about abortion.One in four pregnancies ends in miscarriageand there is virtually no way to tell the difference between a spontaneous abortion (the medical term for miscarriage) and an induced abortion. Anyone with an adverse pregnancy outcome is open to investigation and criminalization. Indeed. this is already happening We can expect it to increase as states pass laws offering bounties to private citizens who report their neighbors. Anyone who can get pregnant is at risk. but members of already marginalized communities are most likely to be targeted. Marshae Jones was indicted for manslaughter after being shot and suffering a miscarriage. because prosecutors felt she hadn t tried hard enough not to get shot. She was released after public outcry. but there are countless other people.Even if you have a miscarriage and you aren t criminalized. you shouldn t count on receiving medical care. Many doctors are reluctant to treat complications from miscarriage. which aren t rare. People can have prolonged bleeding. difficulty passing products. or serious infections. Some doctors will not even receive training on how to manage these complications due to the abortion bans within their states. putting all pregnant people at risk. Recently. for example. some pharmacists have refused to fill misoprostol prescriptions. which can be used for management of miscarriage or abortion ― or treatment of gastric ulcers.Fetal personhood laws give the government broad authority to criminalize pregnant people. The South Carolina courts ruled that pregnant people who use drugs can be prosecuted for child abuse and murder. In Oklahoma. Brittney Poolaw was convicted for manslaughter after she had a miscarriage in a hospital and admitting to using drugs. though there was no evidence the drug use caused the miscarriage.With these laws. people struggling with addiction are less likely to seek prenatal care and drug treatment programs. resulting in worse outcomes for parents and children. States continue this criminalization despite evidence-based recommendations from ACOG opposing the practice. People have even been criminalized for taking medications that were prescribed and monitored by a doctor. When stripping people s bodily autonomy and freedoms in the name of health. lawmakers are unfortunately not required to enact laws based on medical evidence. or laws that improve health and safety outcomes.By making fetuses people. you also strip the rights of potentially pregnant people in any number of ways. If a pharmacist dispenses a medication that results in abortion ― for treatment of cancer. say. or autoimmune conditions ― are they responsible for murder in the eyes of the law? If your health insurance paid for the medication. are they accomplices to homicide? Very few medications are approved for use during pregnancy because of the reluctance to perform prescription drug trials on pregnant people. How far does someone have to go to prove they re not pregnant to access routine health care? This will worsen as states race to inflict the most punitive restrictions. Everyone who can become pregnant will have their access to basic medical care limited.Even in cases where a person s life is threatened (and the state allows such exceptions). clinicians and lawyers are struggling to figure out exactly what that means. An ectopic pregnancy implants outside the uterus and cannot develop into a viable pregnancy. It s the top cause of first-trimester pregnancy death. and is always a medical emergency. Yet people are being turned away for treatment because the pregnancy has not yet ruptured and caused severe internal bleeding. In this example. imminent harm is clear. but the legality is still hazy. People diagnosed with cancer. or other conditions with no identifiable  moment  when their life is at risk. will not have access to life-saving treatment.Someone who wants to deliver a healthy child can also face criminalization if they disagree with their doctor on any aspect of the pregnancy management. Vaginal birth after cesarean is common. and most obstetricians agree it s safe and can reduce pregnancy complications. Laura Pemberton s doctors didn t agree. however. so they obtained a court order for her to undergo a C-section against her will.Pemberton. a Florida woman. was taken into custody. had her legs strapped legs together and was forced to go to the hospital. She later sued. but Florida courts decided that the fetus  best interests outweighed her own First. Fourth and 14th Amendment rights. Despite this horrific medical abuse. and despite being put at increased risk of future pregnancy complications by the repeat C-section. Pemberton went on to deliver three children vaginally.Anti-abortion lawmakers manifestly have no intention of helping pregnant people have successful pregnancies. safe deliveries or healthy children. Republicans have voted against access to baby formula and free school lunches. They ve unanimously voted down paid parental leavewith the help of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia). even though it improves health outcomes for infants the U.S. is one of only 41 countries in the world without parental leave. States with abortion bans are less likely to have adopted Medicaid expansions to provide health insurance for postpartum parents and their children. Minimum wage is so low that millions of Americans can t afford to feed an additional mouth while keeping a roof over their heads. Yet politicians focus on forced birth and the criminalization of pregnant people and their doctors instead of meaningful policy solutions.Safety considerations aside. abortion access tangibly improves lives. The Turnaway Study. conducted by a research program at the University of California. San Francisco. found that people who are  turned away  from obtaining desired abortion care have worse outcomes across the board. When someone who wants or needs an abortion cannot have one. it increases the likelihood of being tethered in an abusive relationship. increases anxiety and mental health problems. and leads to higher rates of unemployment. poverty and reliance on public programs. among other things.All people of all genders should have the right to control their bodies and be respected. whether or not they choose to explain their reasoning to you. People s reasons for seeking abortions are personal and fundamental to the core of their being. Studies like this just give us the scientific data to prove it. The fall of privacy protections from Roe has far-reaching implications. Justice Clarence Thomas offered a grave preview in his Dobbs opinion. writing that the court should re-evaluate all rulings that deal with privacy. due process and equal protection legal standards set by Roe ― specifically citing cases that legalized contraception. same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas tweeted  Now do Plessy vs Ferguson/Brown vs Board of Education.  referring to the decision desegregating public schools. Everyone who believes in basic human freedoms needs to fight against abortion criminalization. or the courts will take us back to a time when only property-owning white men were legally considered people. We have to collectively fight back against this dehumanization. Organize with the reproductive justice and advocacy groups mentioned. and donate to groups that directly support people seeking abortions. The National Network of Abortion Funds pays for travel. child care. medical bills and other abortion-related costs. The Abortion Care Network keeps independent abortion clinics open by funding equipment. security. legal costs and more. The M+A Hotline provides free medical advice from licensed clinicians to people self-managing abortion. Plan C provides medically accurate information. including how to get abortion pills online. Aid Access offers physician-led medication abortion via Austria to ensure access regardless of borders. The Reproductive Health Access Project and Physicians for Reproductive Health train and mobilize doctors who provide abortion care across the country. If you need abortion resources. don t trust a Google search. Fake clinics. called crisis pregnancy centers. pose as abortion clinics to make it more difficult to obtain care. I Need An A and Abortion Finder are two trusted organizations that can help you find a real abortion clinic. Lastly. take action. Go to pro-abortion rights protests. Vote for pro-abortion rights policies. Advocate for laws that support parents and children. Call your legislators. Refuse to be silent. until pregnant people. and everyone who benefits from  equal protection  under the law. are respected as fully human in this country. If it s safe. show up for people seeking abortion care by sharing medically accurate resources or being a trusted confidant. We build power by strengthening our communities.,Health News
Kamala Harris struck down Roe v.

I ll start with the babiest of the babiest of the baby steps: Open abortion clinics on federal lands in red states right now. Right now.  Ocasio-Cortez said at a protest Friday in New York City.Warren made similar remarks at a rally in Boston that day. saying the White House and Congress should  explore just how much we can start using federal lands as a way to protect people who need access to abortions in all the states that either have banned abortions or are clearly on the threshold of doing so. more than a quarterBut Harris said the Biden administration is focused on ensuring people can still access abortion in the places where clinics remain open. saying that what s  most important right now  is  that we do everything we can to empower women to not only seek but to receive the care where it is available. People who need abortions in states where it has been or will soon be outlawed can access the procedure only if they can afford the costs of traveling out of state. which includes the costs of transportation. lodging. missed wages and child care.Bash asked Harris if the Biden administration is prepared to offer  financial resources. some form of voucher for travel. child care services  for people who need that assistance. Harris acknowledged the need but didn t make any firm commitments.  We want to make sure that there [will not be] extreme disparities ... based on who can receive care based on how much money they have got.  she said.The vice president also reaffirmed that the Biden administration is opposed to any states attempting to punish people for helping a patient travel to another state for an abortion. and she added that the Justice Department will challenge those laws in court.,Health News

After five years of marriage. in November 2019. my husband and I decided we were ready to try to conceive (referred to as TTC in the fertility app chat groups). A little over a year later. I finally received my first positive pregnancy test. Due to some spotting and first-time jitters. we were able to get an early ultrasound and at around seven weeks saw a peanut-sized blob with a blinking dot. signifying a heart beat. While we knew the advice to refrain from announcing to the world. we did share the news with our parents. who shared in our joy and excitement.At our 12-week appointment. the ultrasound technician was less talkative and there was no showing of images on the screen. Armed with just one photo. my husband and I were sent back to the lobby to wait for the doctor. As soon as we sat down. I whispered to my husband.  Something is wrong.  After what felt like hours. but in actuality was less than 20 minutes. we found ourselves sitting in the doctor s office as he explained to us that a heartbeat could not be located. While we knew this was a possibility. it did not soften the blow. It had only been two months. but we d already begun imagining our life as a family of three. I had started a private registry and researched car seats. strollers and baby monitors. We had discussed names. We had holiday cards printed and addressed. ready to be dropped in the mail announcing our new addition. Within minutes. all of those dreams were crushed. Our baby was gone. After several blood tests to confirm the miscarriage. I was scheduled for a dilation and curettage. or D&C. at the local hospital within a week. While the experience was heartbreaking. the procedure went smoothly and after a few months of healing both physically and emotionally. we were once again trying to conceive. In July 2021. I found myself pregnant again. Thanks to timing. I was able to tell my husband on his birthday. What a perfect gift! While we knew from our first experience that we should try to contain our excitement. it was difficult.Our previous experience coupled with more spotting meant we were able to again get in early for an ultrasound. which yielded confirmation of a pregnancy and heartbeat. Our 12-week ultrasound also went differently. with the tech showing us the flickering dot and sending us back to the waiting room with multiple sonogram images. We breathed a collective sigh of relief as we waited for the doctor. unaware of what awaited us. When we met with the doctor. he pulled up the sonogram on his computer and began to point out excess fluid behind the head of our fetus. He explained that this fluid was right on the cusp of irregularity and could potentially signal hydrops fetalis. a condition often caused by a chromosomal abnormality and indicative of genetic or developmental issues. He cautioned us to remain optimistic and provided us options. including additional testing and a visit to a specialist. Within days. I had a blood draw for genetic testing (which would indicate the possibility of a chromosomal abnormality) as well as an appointment with a specialist in a large city approximately an hour from home.The specialist performed a high-level ultrasound. which confirmed the initial findings that an abnormal amount of fluid was present in the head of the fetus. I also underwent chorionic villus sampling. an uncomfortable procedure where a small piece of the placenta is removed and sent in for chromosomal testing. And then we waited. Fourteen days felt like years as we tried to stay optimistic and realistic at the same time. The blood test results came in and reported no abnormalities. with the chorionic villus sampling results confirming the finding. This meant I was not a carrier and we could all but rule out any chromosomal issues. At our second appointment with the specialist. another ultrasound revealed fluid in the lungs and abdomen as well as the head. At this point. we knew our baby had a serious medical issue. but didn t know why. After discussions with both the specialist and my primary OB. as well as extensive independent research. my husband and I accepted the reality that the chance of our baby making it to full-term was slim. We also knew that. should we have a successful pregnancy. our child would most likely be born with a serious medical issue. Together. we decided that it would be cruel to risk bringing a child into the world that would suffer and ultimately live a short and unfulfilling life. For us. the right decision. though a hard one. was to end the pregnancy. While I had hoped the most difficult part of this process ― making this impossible decision ― was behind us. scheduling an abortion proved challenging. Unlike my D&C. because my fetus had a heartbeat. I could not have the procedure performed by my regular OB at a local hospital. Instead. I had to make an appointment at a medical facility that performed abortions. My doctor was incredibly supportive and helpful throughout this process and worked with me to provide a recommendation on a facility. which ended up being Planned Parenthood. I was able to secure an appointment. but due to demand and limited availability I was forced to schedule it more than two weeks out. This meant that for two additional weeks. despite the fact I knew our fetus was not viable. I remained mentally and physically pregnant.I continued to experience the symptoms of pregnancy and felt irresponsible making any choices that would harm my fetus. despite the fact I knew it was not viable. On one hand. I dreaded the day of my appointment. while I also looked forward to being able to move forward. The day of my procedure required a day off work. an hour drive (thankfully with the company of my mother and husband). and a payment of $1.115. (I received a reimbursement from my insurance company. but many do not have this luxury and must face a taxing out-of-pocket cost.) After pages of intake paperwork. an ultrasound and a conversation with a clinician. I underwent pre-surgery preparation and sat in a pre-op room for four hours. Because I was more than 16 weeks pregnant. the process was more intensive. and markedly more uncomfortable. Once my body responded to the medications. I was brought into the operating room. While heavily medicated. I was awake during the procedure. Lying in the cold. sterile space. conscious of what was happening. I couldn t help but second-guess my decision. This was not the experience I conjured up when I imagined having a baby. The practitioners in the room attempted to distract me and provided additional medication when I expressed discomfort. but the reality of what was happening could not be ignored. The surgery lasted no more than 15 minutes. but it s a memory that will be forever burned in my memory. Relief mixed with heartache as the doctor wrapped up and I was assisted to the recovery room. There. I rested for a half hour. loopy from medicine and drinking my ginger ale. before I was released to my loved ones. While the process was both mentally and physically draining. I cannot praise enough the staff who provide these services for women in need. It s taken my husband and I some time to feel comfortable sharing our experience. We have a wonderful support system and are confident in the decision we made. That being said. our choice was. and remains. controversial. But it shouldn t be.In 2019. 629.898 legal inducedabortions were reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The fact that we are trying to conceive and chose to have an abortion comes as a shock to many. but upon hearing our full experience. they begin to understand the gray area in an issue previously seen as black and white. And while my hope is that sharing our experience will help to change perceptions. no pregnant person should have to justify their decision. The world should not play judge and jury to such an intimate and personal experience. As fate would have it. I m writing this mere hours after learning I am pregnant again. After two unsuccessful pregnancies. those two lines on the pregnancy test bring both trepidation and joy. The excitement of the possibility of growing our family cannot completely overpower the worry and fear of  what if.  What if I miscarry? What if there are medical issues? These are rational concerns. but ones that cannot be answered. Only time will tell. What I should not have to worry about is not having the right to make the decision that is best for myself and my family. should complications arise. I should not have to worry about losing autonomy over my body. I should not have to worry about losing my voice. I should not have to worry about losing my choice. No pregnant person should.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we re looking for here and send us a pitch.,Health News

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) sidestepped a question on whether he would make exceptions in the state s abortion laws. which were triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. for cases that involve rape or incest.When NBC s  Meet The Press  host Chuck Todd asked Hutchinson if he believed it was a mistake not to include exceptions in the abortion laws for those specific cases. the governor avoided answering the question directly and asserted that the Supreme Court s decision  was really something that will save lives. Friday s Supreme Court ruling It triggered the ban on abortion except. as you [Todd] said. in the case of the life of the mother.  the governor explained.Todd pressed Hutchinson further on the matter again. asking if the governor would be comfortable if a theoretical 13-year-old. who was raped by a relative. could not get an abortion in Arkansas.The governor responded by suggesting he wouldn t be comfortable with that. I m not — I would ve preferred a different outcome than that.  Hutchinson replied.  But that s not the debate today in Arkansas. It might be in the future. Hutchinson s comments on Sunday run counter to remarks he made during an interview with the THV11 news station in Little Rock.When asked a similar question on rape and incest by Arkansas-based journalist Sarah Horbacewicz earlier this weekend. Hutchinson said he did not expect to revisit making exceptions to the state s abortion ban. The legislative will was clear.  he said in that Friday interview.  I don t expect that to be revisited in the short term. if at all. because they expressed the will of the people of Arkansas that they want to protect the life of the unborn. As the state s abortion ban stands now. the only exception Arkansas will make is when the mother s life is at risk.Arkansas is among 13 states. including Louisiana. Mississippi. Texas and Utah. which all had trigger laws enacted after Roe v. Wade was overturned. according to pro-life research organization Guttmacher Institute. ,Health News
My husband and I race our semi-conscious daughter through the Emergency Room doors. Under the hospital s bright lights. our daughter s body looks like a pile of bones on the gurney.  What have you done to her?  the doctor hisses. Specialists are pulled in with increasing urgency as they seek to find a working vein. My daughter. Eden. will soon be diagnosed with a disease we had no idea she had. Her condition is critical. Later. we will come to know that for almost a week. medical professionals at her sleep-away camp believed her escalating lethargy. nausea and weight loss to be homesickness. Every minute she wasn t being treated was a minute closer to death. ***The camp nurse doesn t sound alarmed when she calls days earlier to tell me Eden has eaten very little. I am with my husband. Gary. and our son. Major. on a lake vacation. having visited our daughters. Eden. 10. and Emma. 13. almost a week earlier for Visiting Day. At camp for a month. my daughters had appeared well-adjusted when we visited. a smattering of fresh freckles across their noses. Balancing on water skis with new best friends. they were poster children for an idyllic summer. So when the nurse says.  seems like homesickness to me.  I am in disbelief.The following day. when a nurse reports that Eden is with her bunk playing tennis. we point the car towards home. ready to conclude our vacation. Hours later. however. a camp doctor calls. Eden is back in the infirmary. Camp rules dictate just one planned call each summer with your camper unless there is an emergency. Something in my gut screams that this is. I m not right.  Eden mumbles. Her voice is weak. incomprehensible. Wasn t she just playing tennis? It s only later that camp photos posted online will reveal her on the courts that day. thin and fragile. resting her head on her knees while others volleyed on the courts.I scan through a mental catalog of medical mystery shows I ve seen. A lake born illness? A parasite? When we pull into camp hours later. I wait in the car with my sleeping son while Gary retrieves Eden. We will find a hotel somewhere. I think. She will feel better in our presence. When Gary emerges from the infirmary with our daughter draped across his arms. I do not recognize her. Eden s breathing is labored; she is pale and unwashed. My hands are shaking. I can t find the seat belt slot.  We need a hospital. Gary.  As we pull onto the highway. Eden vomits onto her chest. For just a moment. relief floods me. Maybe she got it out. this bug. whatever it is. But when Eden s eyes close and remain still. I punch the nearest hospital into our GPS. *** We don t know what s wrong.  I plead. A team of doctors descend upon us. Eden s veins are so collapsed it takes forever to draw blood and insert her IV. She has vanished into the white pillow. At her birth. ten years earlier. her 10-pound weight surprises everyone. Pink and slippery. she is quickly taken from me. There is talk of blood sugar. gestational diabetes. But we are both given a clean bill of health. I am too exhausted to realize. though time-stamped photos later reveal. it took hours for me to finally hold my baby.  Your daughter has Type 1 Diabetes.  the doctor says now.  Her blood sugar is 500.  I hear his words but nothing makes sense.  She s in Diabetic Ketoacidosis.  he says. explaining the critical condition of undiagnosed diabetes.  Our hospital is not equipped.  Sirens pierce the night as an ambulance speeds us to a children s hospital hours away in another city. I ride with Eden in the back. I will not leave her side. Though insulin is already being administered. she remains unresponsive. At the Intensive Care Unit. we will find out her kidneys are failing. her body now acidic. She is 15% dehydrated. She has lost 13 pounds. Death is a potential threat. Balancing her sodium. potassium. chloride and insulin becomes a choreography we must master for her to live. With a threat of brain damage. we wait five days in ICU to determine if she has fluid on her brain. if she will slip into a coma. I barely sleep on a hard chair. woken by her cries. We will find out her diagnosis has nothing to do with her large weight at birth ― it is a genetic autoimmune disease. Different chaplains visit daily. I am not a religious person. yet I accept every prayer offered. Surely I am not meant to lose my daughter. When we sent our daughters to camp that summer. we told them to treat other adults as parents. In loco parentis. But. as Eden s actual parents. we would never have dismissed her concerns or ignored the telltale signs of failing health. For one week. Eden knew she needed help. Yet. the Tums and Gatorade dispensed to her at each infirmary visit did nothing to address the issue. In fact. the sugar exacerbated it. Camp protocol meant we weren t called until Eden felt sick enough to request to sleep in the infirmary. Even then the symptoms described to us were minimized. More often than not. we have been told. many summer ailments and complaints are attention seeking or don t require medical attention. T1D is often confused with other illnesses. A simple. inexpensive finger stick or urine test is all that was needed to diagnose her. If it had been protocol to test just one drop of blood or urine for high glucose levels. DKA and life threatening complications could have been prevented. At what point would a medical professional have understood Eden was experiencing an acute medical emergency? We will never know. My mother s sense is what saved her. In the months following Eden s diagnosis. my husband and I practice scenarios in which our children advocate for their safety. their health and each other. We know. too well. the perils of following rules and of being polite. No adult will ever again undermine my children s feelings.   Throw good manners out the window.  I say.  Be relentless.  The kids have been trained to not back down. to demand full visibility. If something feels wrong. it likely is.  Trust your gut.  I remind them.  Speak to every adult until you reach us. Grab a phone off someone s desk if you must.  I will always be okay with it. Learning to live with Type 1 Diabetes that first year was a challenge. Learning to advocate and challenge adults and those in charge. even more so. Yet the following summer. Eden is ready to finish what she started. We find a new camp. led by directors who staff a nurturing and responsive 24-hour nursing unit. To the shock of many. we send our insulin dependent daughter to camp for another four weeks. She picks up where she left off on the lake. albeit a different one. waterskiing with new summer sisters. She learns to rely on a nursing team that listens and observes deeply. She learns to object. to question and to remain steadfast. Most importantly. she advocates and trusts her ability to take care of herself. She does so each summer for four more years at a camp that becomes her second home. A far cry from the limp little girl in my husband s arms whose voice was not heard. Eden. a rising high school senior. is now an active. confident teen who is a JDRF Youth Ambassador. an advocate and diabetes educator. Eden maintains that she wouldn t change anything about her diagnosis or experience. Resiliency and bravery have shaped her into the strongest advocate I know. A native New Yorker.

 And 573 evacuees. mostly elderly residents. died from stress related to the incident. according to a survey by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.The response. however. was seismic. Japan halted all its reactors. South Korea s ruling liberal party adopted an unwavering anti-nuclear stance. The U.S. shelved most plans for new nuclear reactors and continued shutting down existing ones. Germany adopted the most extreme position. making the closure of its nuclear fleet a priority over the next decade. In the Netherlands. Rutte called the German response  curious  and said he hoped to continue with plans for more nuclear power. But Delta struggled to find partners for the project and in 2011 delayed the licensing procedure. In 2012. the municipally owned utility ― which has since changed its name to the Provincial Zeeland Energy Company ― suspended plans for a new reactor indefinitely.By 2018. however. the planet s temperatures had risen by about 1 degree Celsius on average. causing billions of dollars in damage from the resulting increase in cataclysmic storms. heat and floods. Far from even flattening out. planet-heating emissions were still growing year over year. That October. the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a stark new report outlining what it would mean if the planet warms by 1.5 degrees and what it would take to prevent that from happening. The conclusions were relatively conservative. given that the IPCC is a consensus-based body with hundreds of scientists from almost every country. Yet they were sobering. Humanity needed an unprecedented overhaul of the entire global economy. and it needed to happen with almost unfathomable speed. To do that. the scientists concluded. nuclear power would need to play a part. Even before the IPCC report came out. pro-nuclear advocates had set their sights on the Netherlands. hoping the Rutte government s embrace of atomic energy could yield a breakthrough. In September 2018. Michael Shellenberger. a pro-nuclear activist from California. held a workshop in Amsterdam for advocates hoping to reverse Europe s nuclear retreat. Known for his pugnacious style and political provocations. the American. who would later go on to make an unsuccessful bid for governor of California. implored his audience to go on the offense and hold more public demonstrations in support of nuclear power. In late October. pro-nuclear activists gathered to do just that and held a rally in Munich. Germany. Dutch news stations covered the event. That rally. and the TV coverage of it. would prove remarkably effective. Among the many Dutch viewers who saw the news segment was Arjen Lubach. the host of a weekly satirical news show who is often compared to John Oliver. and with good reason: both men s shows have a similar pacing and tone. Lubach devoted a 20-minute segment of a November 2018 show to puncturing what he described as the myths and taboos of nuclear energy.  The IPCC basically says we can t go without nuclear energy. we must use it. And a lot of environmental groups. for example Greenpeace. are in denial.  Lubach said near the end of his monologue. teeing up a clip of a Dutch Greenpeace spokesperson saying  cleaner solutions  are preferable to nuclear power.  Yeah. that s what everyone says.  Lubach said. throwing his arms up in the air.  Everyone feels that way! But we don t have that luxury.  The nuclear plant at Borssele. he said. produced as much energy as 600 Eiffel Tower-sized wind turbines during one good year. If we are serious about the climate. we really need to think differently and look at nuclear power.  Lubach said.  It may well be that in 40 years we invent something with really good batteries. or that we produce energy from the static fur of our pets. or whatever. But as long as we don t have those optimistic futuristic techniques. we just need nuclear power. Lubach s broadcasts often reached 600.000 to 1 million viewers. But that segment had been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube alone as of this June. It marked something of a turning point. Within days of the episode airing. lawmakers from Rutte s VVD party introduced a proposal to build new nuclear plants. And Dutch newspapers. especially the more conservative-leaning Die Telegraaf. started pumping out a steady stream of stories backing up Lubach s point that it was time to overcome old fears and embrace nuclear power again. The resulting years of debate concluded last December with a coalition government agreement between Rutte s VVD. the centrist D66 party and two Christian parties. The agreement called for building two new nuclear power plants with 500 million euros. or about $522 million. in government spending to back the projects up by 2025. Total government support for new nuclear. the coalition projected. would top 5 billion euros by the end of the decade. The agreement listed Borssele as one of three viable sites for the new reactors. along with one in Groningen and another outside Rotterdam.But in an interview with HuffPost over Zoom. Dutch Energy Minister Rob Jetten said Borssele would be the most likely location. A studyBy July 1. Jetten s office said it would send a letter to the Netherlands  House of Representatives. the lower house of the country s parliament. outlining the government s process for building new reactors. It s considered the next procedural step before companies can start drafting proposals.To supporters of nuclear power. the steps marked desperately overdue progress at a time when it s needed more urgently than ever before. Not only is the Netherlands already on pace to miss its climate goals. Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions and embargoes have sent oil and gas prices soaring across Europe. As their gas bills help fund the Russian war effort. European Union countries are scrambling for alternatives. including striking new deals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S.. Israel and Egypt. New supplies. however. have failed to match demand as Russia slashed gas exportsnow looking to completeFinland offers a particularly poignant case study in support of nuclear power. The Nordic country. which borders Russia. has long embraced atomic energy. Even groups like the local Greenpeace chapter and the country s Green Party. traditionally beachheads for the anti-nuclear movement. support the Finnish industry. Thanks in part to that widespread support. the Finnish in March switched on the long-delayed Olkiluoto-3. one of the world s largest reactors and the first new one in western Europe in at least 15 years. Two months later. Russia cut off electricity exports to Finland in retaliation for the country s plan to ditch its decades-long neutrality and join in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The move barely affected Finland. which could now generate nearly 40% of its national power needs from the three reactors on a tiny fleck of land off its southwest coast.Finland is dark for much of the year. limiting how much solar power the country can generate. The Finns are building more wind energy. But wind power alone cannot reliably power an industrial society of its size. at least under current conditions. Milder than expected winds last summer increased European demand for gas just as prices for the fuel were already spiking. making it harder for countries to refill stockpiles for the winter. And recent research in the journal Nature Geosciences suggests wind patterns could shift significantly as the planet warms. making that resource even less reliable in the years to come. Today. wind turbines are ubiquitous in the Netherlands. towering even over densely populated areas near Amsterdam. In March. the Dutch government announced plans to double its offshore wind capacity. But the country has pitched itself as Europe s future hub for green hydrogen. a zero-carbon fuel that. like fossil fuels. can burn at high temperatures. Hydrogen is already widely used in fertilizers and industrial processes. but virtually all of the fuel on the market today is produced with natural gas or coal. To qualify as  green  in the hydrogen industry s color-coding system. the fuel must be made with machines called electrolysers that are powered by wind or solar electricity. The Netherlands has so far vowed to spend more on subsidies for green hydrogen and build more electrolyser plants than any other European Union country. But it s a controversial energy solution. because roughly 30% of that renewable electricity is lost in the conversion process for making hydrogen. So for those plans to pan out. the Dutch will need to divert huge volumes of renewable power to hydrogen production. How. then. is the Netherlands supposed to produce enough zero-carbon power to replace its remaining coal- and gas-fired power plants while also providing for the new demand from electric vehicles and home appliances – all while manufacturing green hydrogen in quantities large enough to be competitive? Majorities of Dutch people would likely say the answer is nuclear power. A 2018 poll from the news broadcaster EenVandaag found 54% of Dutch adults in favor of nuclear power and 35% against. When the question was reframed to say that the Netherlands could achieve its 2050 climate goals with nuclear power. 63% expressed support with only 27% against. In 2019. 51% of Dutch adults supported new investments in nuclear energy. with just 14% opposed. in a survey from the pollster Ipsos. More than half of Dutch people 35 and younger responded that they  completely agree  with building new nuclear power stations. with less than one-third of respondents against it in a 2021 pollThe one polling outlier appears to be a 2020 survey from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics. which asked respondents to give their opinions on energy sources after explaining:  Energy is sustainable when it s produced by sources that don t hurt the climate and will never run out. such as solar and wind. Yet that framing appeared to weigh on how the issue was perceived. In response to the prompt. 25% of those surveyed said they favored more nuclear power. 12% said the current amount was appropriate. about 18% said they preferred less nuclear power and a little over 25% wanted none of it at all.A comedian may have helped shift Dutch public opinion on nuclear power. But asked where things go from here. Gerard Brinkman. one of the Dutch anti-nuclear movement s most prominent figures. chortled.  This is not the first time for any of this.  he said over Zoom last month.  We had the same proposal in 1985. then the accident in Chernobyl halted those plans. There were the same plans also in 2010. Then came Fukushima. So. as a sick joke. I almost think that every time the right-wing parties in the Netherlands are proposing to build new nuclear power plants. there will be some new accident around the world. Hopefully not. of course.  This might be gallows humor were Brinkman not so convinced that the government s plans for new reactors would never make it past the paperwork phase. Advocates of nuclear power point to the United Arab Emirates  Barakah Nuclear Power Plant as a sign that an industry revival is possible. Despite starting construction in 2011 just after the Fukushima accident. the $24 billion station in the Abu Dhabi desert completed construction on its third reactor last November. The full trio. built by South Korea s Korea Electric Power Corp. with enough capacity to supply 25% of the energy-thirsty UAE s needs. is scheduled to start producing power next year. But the UAE is an authoritarian country with almost unrivaled oil riches. Democratic countries with cultures and political systems more akin to the Netherlands have faced steeper challenges. In the U.S.. two South Carolina utilities abruptly canceled construction on two new nuclear plants in 2017 after spending $9 billion and billing ratepayers for the cost. Now the only new reactors underway in the country are two units at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in eastern Georgia. The project broke ground in 2012 at a price tag of about $14 billion and promised to be producing electricity by 2017. After a series of delays. the reactors have now cost more than $30 billion and won t be completed until next year at the earliest. Meanwhile. states like New York and Michigan have closed nuclear plants deemed safe to operate. replacing the reactors with fossil fuels.In the United Kingdom. Hinkley Point C. a two-unit nuclear plant the French utility giant EDF is building in southwest England. is facing similar delays and cost overruns. with the price tag now topping $31 billion. Those problems have even crossed the English Channel into France. which famously generates most of its electricity from fission after building 56 nuclear reactors in just 15 years. starting in the mid-1970s. In January. EDF announced delays and new expenses on its Flamanville 3 reactor. Now a mysterious corrosion issue is plaguing nearly half of the country s reactors. with a dozen closed and awaiting inspections as of this month. Finland finished its Olkiluoto-3. but the project took 12 years to complete. And the country pulled the plug on its next nuclear reactor. a joint venture with the Russian state-owned nuclear firm Rosatom. after the Ukraine war broke out. In an interview in a plain conference room at Borssele. Carlo Wolters. the chief executive of the plant operator EPZ. said his company would propose building the next Dutch reactors right here. But he said he would reject any bids from Russian or Chinese companies. which he said posed too much geopolitical risk.  If you build a nuclear plant. you have to look 60 years ahead. so it s wise to choose partners you can build a stable relationship with.  Wolters said. Doing so. however. shrinks a pool of potential investors that critics of nuclear power say is already too shallow to yield results.  The reality is. I don t think anything will be built.  said Jan Haverkamp. a senior expert on nuclear energy and energy policy at Greenpeace.  Although the conservatives are claiming that there are interested parties in the market. there are no really interested parties. Borssele is profitable. EPZ said. The KPMG study found that companies interested in bidding on nuclear projects or buying power from new reactors see a stable government policy on nuclear energy as a necessary precondition to building new facilities. And the country s prime minister for the last 12 years has remained steadfast in his support of nuclear power.But the Netherlands is bound by an international agreement known as the Aarhus Convention. which gives countries within a certain radius of any large industrial projects. including nuclear reactors. the right to voice opposition. Germany and Belgium. both of which are on track to close their own nuclear reactors within the next few years. would almost certainly challenge the Dutch plans. And even within the Netherlands. Dutch law gives opponents of nuclear power ample opportunities to push back against the plans.  Haverkamp is an expert at lining up rules and regulations and knowing when to interrupt something and when to stay quiet. so definitely these guys will make it as difficult as possible.  said Joris van Dorp. a pro-nuclear activist who helped organize the 2018 rally in Munich. He said he and other supporters of nuclear power were urging the Rutte administration to prepare for those challenges in part by changing Dutch laws to give reactors the same fast-track process that benefits wind and solar projects. But even that may prove ineffective against a determined opposition.  It only takes one guy or girl to chain themselves to a fence and lock down a whole building site for weeks. You can do a lot of damage.  van Dorp said.  You can really get people riled up and get people to accept that there are all sorts of ways you can stop these projects from proceeding within the confines of the law. Then it s going to be hard. its support fordogged opponentStill. Silvio Erkens. a Dutch member of parliament from the VVD party. said at least two-thirds of the legislature supports the prime minister s plan for new reactors.  Am I certain they will be built? As certain as you can be in parliament.  he said.  We reserved money for it. got a majority in parliament and agreed that in the coming three years it will make the decision irreversible. It will not be built in three years. But it should be irreversible.  Yet already some supporters of nuclear power have expressed concern that Jetten. the energy minister. is slow-walking the government s letter to parliament on new nuclear reactors. which was originally due to come out this month. A member of the D66 party. Jetten previously opposed new reactors. I was born and raised in a village where everyone is anti-nuclear because of the U.S. Air Force presence over there. Everyone has an emotional history. a family history. and I ve even got people in my own political party who joined anti-nuclear protests 30 years ago.  Jetten told me over Zoom.  But I m now advocating for nuclear power because of the independence Europe should get from Russian imports.… Countries that have invested more in nuclear power plants are in a better position these days.  Still. he said.  I m 35. and I don t want to be a climate minister who was responsible for a huge nuclear waste problem that new generations have to deal with. So. there are pros and cons.  Haverkamp said the government s money would be better spent on energy efficiency measures or building dense. low-carbon apartment buildings in a country struggling with a housing shortage and a dependence on gas heating systems. Even if the reactors were built. he said.  it will take years.  They will not be connected to grids until 2034 or 2035. which means we re spending 5 billion euros at least. maybe more. for climate solutions that will not be a climate solution for the next 13 to 14 years.  Haverkamp said. Some nuclear boosters have suggested the Netherlands should consider small modular reactors. essentially reworked versions of the technology that powers nuclear submarines. While estimates vary. industry analysts generally project the technology will become commercially viable within the next five years. and proponents say the smaller machines. with parts that can be manufactured in a factory. will be much cheaper and easier to deploy.  Building nuclear power plants takes a lot of time and a lot of money. These are political risks. but I am confident the current political coalition is determined to get the ball rolling.  Henri Bontenbal. an energy consultant and Dutch member of parliament from the center-right Christian Democratic Appeal party. told me in an email.  Therefore I believe that small nuclear reactors can be a worthwhile addition to the nuclear mix. as those plants could operate before 2030. But supporters of nuclear power say building new reactors does. in fact. represent a long-term strategy and one that should not interfere with near-term plans to deploy more renewables. install more electric vehicle infrastructure and make buildings more efficient. A large part of why nuclear plants have become so expensive and slow. they argue. is simply that few countries have been building them. As such. the workforce of designers. project managers and construction crews with experience building reactors has shrunk over the past four decades. The completion of projects in the UAE. U.S. and Finland could make more of those skills available to the Netherlands.  Restarting European nuclear construction is as painful as it is necessary.  said Mark Nelson. a Chicago-based nuclear engineer and consultant who advocates for atomic power.  Who better to get it off to a good start again than the Dutch. who have always had to engineer to survive?  Even if it s difficult and costly. research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that the best way to truly decarbonize a power grid and avoid blackouts while doing so is to pair renewables with what are called  firm  sources of zero-carbon generation. such as nuclear reactors. hydroelectric dams or geothermal power. The low-lying Netherlands is too flat for dams. and. while geothermal energy has significant potential. the country does not have the vast volcanic heat resources of nearby Iceland.  Renewables are very good. but the economy as we know it today. where we gained a lot of wealth. longevity and healthier. longer life through use of fossil energy. you can t replace that with just renewables.  said Floriske Deutman. a consultant and member of D66 who has tried to push the party to embrace nuclear power.  Most people don t realize that. She compared opposing nuclear energy as a tool to deal with climate change to opposing COVID-19 vaccines.  The hardcore anti-nuclear people are similar to the anti-vaccine movement. because it s based on misleading information to solve a problem.  Deutman said.  Unless solving the climate crisis and mitigating global warming is not your primary concern.  One May afternoon. the sun broke through the clouds over Borssele. illuminating the construction cranes dismantling what remained of the coal plant EPZ once ran next to the nuclear station. The nearby refinery was largely quiet. The steam turbine in the nuclear plant hummed steadily. During a tour of the facility to see the reactor up close. a worker told me you could see the hyperboloid cooling towers of Belgium s Doel Nuclear Power Station from atop the dike that protected this part of Zeeland from the North Sea. The plant. located on the outskirts of the Belgian industrial metropolis Antwerp. was one of the country s last two nuclear stations. The plan had been to shut both facilities down in the next three years. though the government in Brussels is reconsidering as energy prices spike.I climbed the grassy barrier. which had been elevated after the devastating 1953 floods that killed more than 1.800 people. For centuries. the Dutch had summoned their country from watery depths. draining swamps. digging canals and redirecting rivers to claim land for their people. But after that catastrophe. the Netherlands renewed its commitment to engineering its long-term survival in a place that could be easily reclaimed by the sea. Up went higher sea barriers.From atop the dike. Antwerp was invisible. shrouded behind a veil of smog and haze. As I squinted. I wondered. could the view possibly be clearer from the other side? ,Health News

Shortly after the Supreme Court ended guaranteed abortion rights in the United States on Friday. Scott Pruitt. a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Oklahoma. declared the ruling had delivered  JUSTICE for the Unborn!  Praise God! What an amazing step forward to protect the innocent.  Pruitt wrote in a tweet. However. the policies Pruitt fought for throughout his career ― especially during his short but tumultuous tenure as President Donald Trump s first Environmental Protection Agency chief ― increased types of pollution linked to fetal defects and premature births.By stymying efforts to reduce fossil fuel use. and actively promoting an increase in how much oil. gas and coal are burned by the world s largest economy. Pruitt played a notable role in hastening the rate at which the planet s temperature will rise. a shift expected to cause increasingly deadly storms. floods. fires and ultimately famines. wars and mass migrations.But what s perhaps less abstract. and more jarring. is how those same policies allowed an increase of tiny. invisible particles circulating in the air around drilling sites. highways and power plants.While carbon dioxide travels skyward. microscopic bits of particulate matter lace the air and lodge in the lungs of the people who breathe it. Studies have linked exposure to that pollution with an almost jaw-dropping list of medical conditions. from the expected. like asthma. lung cancer and heart diseases. to the more surprising. such as dementia. schizophrenia and erectile dysfunction. And research indicates that  the unborn  and the recently born pay a particularly high price.About 20% of newborn deaths worldwide are the result of complications linked to air pollution exposure. according to the 2020 State of Global Air report.The connection has long been understood. Between 2000 and 2005. federal scientists monitoring pregnancies in New Jersey. Ohio and Pennsylvania found that exposure to fine particulate matter during both the earliest and final stages of pregnancy were  strongly associated  with premature birth. Researchers in South Texas examined birth records between 2012 and 2015 and found a 50% higher chance of preterm birth among pregnant people living near oil and gas drilling sites with high rates of  flaring  ― a common practice where companies burn gas that is cheaper to lose than it is to collect. A 2017 study examining the effects of shutting down nuclear power plants offered a clear indication of the electricity sector s potential impacts. During a panic over atomic energy following the Three Mile Island accident in the 1980s. the Tennessee Valley Authority. the federally owned utility that generates a large share of power in the Southeastern U.S.. switched to burning more coal. Following the subsequent surge in coal-linked air pollution.  infants born after the nuclear shutdown in the most affected areas had lower birth weight than the ones born in less affected places. In 2019 alone.  air pollution likely contributed to almost 6 million premature births and almost 3 million underweight babies.  according to a study published last year by the University of California. San Francisco.Preterm birth and low birth weights were hardly the only risks. A separate study conducted in Texas between 1997 and 2000 found that women exposed to air pollution commonly produced by burning fossil fuels during the third. seventh and eighth weeks of their pregnancy faced a higher risk of the baby developing heart defects. Research from China backed up the findings. concluding in 2016 that exposure to that same kind of air pollution led to a higher risk of congenital heart defects. especially ventricular septal defect. where there is a hole in the wall separating the heart s two lower chambers. Pruitt s regulations relaxing pollution standards for power plants and automobiles were all widely projected to increase the volumes of particulate matter in the air. But he sought to take that agenda further as EPA administrator. proposing to permanently limit what kinds of studies the agency s staff could consider when writing future rules. His proposal explicitly aimed to give more weight to how much pollution limits would cost companies. It wasn t just air pollution. Pruitt proposed shifting oversight of the containment sites for toxic coal ash to state regulators that had smaller budgets and fewer resources to identify bad practices and actors. The proposal came just a few years after coal ash spilled at multiple sites across the Southeast. spreading carcinogenic pollutants. Exposure to coal ash is linked to low birth weight and cancer in children. In a 2009 lawsuit. parents in the Dominican Republic whose babies were born with deformed skulls. missing limbs and missing organs blamed a coal ash pile in their community. The U.S. coal power company named in the litigation. Virginia-based AES Corp.. ultimately settled.Examples abound of conspicuous hypocrisy among those who fight to ban legal. safe abortions and restrict the millennia-old procedure to a black market where violence. rape and deadly makeshift methods go unchecked. The same political coalition calling for laws forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term has opposed efforts to provide the kinds of government programs available in most other capitalist democracies to make the medical services and child care needed after giving birth cheaper and more widely available. Those declaring themselves  pro-life  have largely supported the death penalty and prioritized the right of hobbyists to purchase firearms designed for killing soldiers on the battlefield over the right of schoolchildren not to have their bodies blown to bits by those weapons.In that sense. the gap between Pruitt s rhetoric and his record on the sanctity of fetal life seems unlikely. on its own. to harm his political prospects.,Health News
struck down Roe v. WadeThe agreement. deemed the Multi-State Commitment to Reproductive Freedom. is an acknowledgment that states with abortion bans may soon attempt to stop their residents from seeking out the procedure in states where it remains legal. We will not stand on the sidelines as these attacks mount.  the three Democratic governors said in the announcement.They re committing to work on several safeguards for abortion patients and providers who are seeking and administering care in their states. including protecting against any cooperation with out-of-state investigations and arrests. refusing the extradition of people wanted for abortion-related criminal prosecution in other states. protecting people s medical records. defending abortion providers against attempts to have their licenses revoked. fending off misinformation about reproductive health care. and expanding abortion access in California. Oregon and Washington.  This is not the America we know ― and it s not the California way.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. adding.  We refuse to go back and we will fight like hell to protect our rights and our values.  Abortion is health care. and no matter who you are or where you come from. Oregon doesn t turn away anyone seeking health care. Period.  Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said. Washington state remains steadfast in our commitment to protecting the ability and right of every patient who comes to our state in need of abortion care. and we will fight like hell to restore that right to patients all across the country.

Nancy PelosiFacing reporters less than an hour after the Supreme Court ruled that Roe v. Wade was no more. Pelosi quoted a written statement that she had ready for this day. saying the decision underscored the need to keep Democratic control of Congress. She touted a gun bill that was going to become law.But then she paused and returned to the abortion ruling. saying quietly.  I am personally overwhelmed by this decision  and proceeded to quote lyrics to a song she said she sometimes reads. I have no other country/Even though my land is burning.  the song by Israeli lyricist and translator Ehud Manor begins.  Here is my home/I shall not be silent/For my country has changed her face.  Pelosi read. stopping to repeat the phrase  my country has changed her face.  I shall not give up on her/I shall remind her/and sing into her ears until she opens her eyes.  Pelosi said. Clearly. we hope that the Supreme Court would open its eyes. The moment — an uncommonly emotional one for the usually reserved Pelosi — summed up her initial reaction: an apparent combination of anger. frustration and determination to press on. even as the odds seem overwhelmingly long.She reserved a good deal of ire for former President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). the architects of the current Supreme Court lineup that formally handed down the decision today that Washington had been expecting for weeks. She called out McConnell for not allowing Barack Obama to name a successor to Antonin Scalia and then rushing the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for Trump weeks before an election. The inconsistency. the hypocrisy — I don t respect that process. OK?  she said.She then took aim at the justices who voted for the decision. especially the ones who. during their nomination processes. said they would respect  stare decisis.  the idea that precedents should be respected and only changed with care. How about those justices. coming before the senators and saying they respected ‘stare decisis.  the precedent of the court? That they respected the right of privacy in the Constitution of the United States?  she asked. Did you hear that? Were they not telling the truth then? Pelosi noted the House had already passed legislation to put into law the right to abortion — an effort stalled in the Senate — and said Democrats need to maintain control of Congress and elect two more Democrats in the Senate to allow it to scrap the filibuster. A woman s right to choose. reproductive freedom. is on the ballot in November.  she said.Success. she said. depended on people knowing what was going on and becoming energized. like in 2017 immediately after Trump was sworn in. resulting in Democrats taking the House in 2018. We have to have something commensurate with that.  she said. It is clear that we just have to win a majority in November. Everything is at stake. ,Health News
The same daystruck downblockedblockedPlanned ParenthoodAll of the recent bans have no exceptions for rape or incest ― only an exception if the life of the mother is at risk. although pro-choice experts point out that the language around these types of exceptions is vague.States such as West Virginia have not yet fully outlawed abortion. but they do have abortion bans on the books that predated the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It s unclear how or when some of these pre-Roe bans will be implemented. forcing many clinics to stop services altogether to avoid risking the prosecution of the clinic. staff or their patients. Providers in West Virginia. as well as Arizona and Wisconsin. have stopped offering abortion care due to ambiguity over whether pre-Roe abortion bans are in effect yet. Other states. like Virginia. Montana and Tennessee. are not far behind: Many lawmakers are calling to swiftly enact abortion restrictions. Ohio. as well as Tennessee and South Carolina. implemented six-week abortion restrictions after the Supreme Court decision freed up bans that had been blocked by lower courts before Roe fell. Millions of women of reproductive age no longer have access to abortion care in the states that have banned abortion. That number doesn t include many nonbinary and genderqueer people who are able to get pregnant and will also no longer have access to these services. South Dakota s last abortion clinic was forced to pause services ahead of the Supreme Court ruling. anticipating the fall of Roe.told HuffPost in FebruaryNow. with abortion illegal in South Dakota. she hopes the patients she served there can reach her in Minnesota.  Last week. when we performed our last abortion. I was the physician there. and the last patient I saw had a story very similar to most patients I see. She was a young mother. she already had children. she was struggling to make ends meet and couldn t imagine bringing another child into that circumstance.  Traxler told reporters on Friday.  Thankfully. she was able to make decisions about her life and her family that were right for her.  I ve seen countless women like this throughout my career. and unfortunately for the women of South Dakota. this is no longer a reality. They are now subject to the opinions of legislators who are not impacted by this decision.  she added.issued his opinion Today. the overruling of Roe and Casey permits Missouri to renew its proud pro-life traditions and restore basic legal protection for the most fundamental of human rights — the right to life.

Many abortion clinics in the Lone Star State were forced to restrict their services due to the ban. but after Friday s ruling. almost all will be forced to close their doors. Whole Woman s HealthThe clinics in Texas have been bracing for the end of Roe for weeks now. Sadler said. So much so that they had a predetermined last day of work for all clinic staff who will inevitably lose their jobs. Sadler and other clinic staff have been advised that there will be some legal challenge to Paxton s rule that a pre-Roe ban is still in effect in Texas. Hopefully. Sadler said. they will get some more time to provide care before the trigger ban goes into full effect.  I m not sure what the next few days or weeks will look like in Texas. If we re able to provide care. we will.  she said.  We definitely know the inevitable. which is that we will have to close the clinics.  A lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Right. the ACLU and the ACLU of Texas. among others. blocked the pre-Roe ban for now. Abortion up to the six-week point resumed immediately in Texas until at least July 12th. when a hearing in the court challenge is set.to lift an injunction As the Supreme Court recognized in Dobbs. the State has a valid interest in protecting the lives of unborn Tennesseans.  Slatery said in his filing.  Those lives are at risk each day the preliminary injunction remains in place. so this Court should grant the State s motion as soon as possible.  On Tuesday. Tennessee s six-week abortion ban went into effect after the Sixth Circuit court vacated an injunction blocking the law that had been tied up in legal challenges for two years. Despite abortion not technically being illegal in Alabama just yet. Attorney General Steve Marshall released a statement that he plans to make a pre-Roe abortion ban enforceable. Because of this. abortion clinics like West Alabama Women s Clinic were forced to turn away every patient seeking an abortion in order to protect the clinic and its patients from possible prosecution.  Every single one of those patients that were in the clinic today ― all 21 of them ― were told that unfortunately they are no longer going to get an abortion at all in the state of Alabama and that all we could do was help them try to book appointments in other states.  said Robin Marty. the operations director at West Alabama Women s Center. Alabama state law required people seeking abortions to visit a clinic twice in order to get the procedure. The first appointment involved a state-mandated ultrasound and counseling. Forty-eight hours after that first appointment. a patient could go back to the clinic and get their abortion pills or a procedure.Many of Marty s patients had already had their first visit but. after Friday s decision. won t be able to come back for the second appointment to get their abortions.  That was just today s patients.  she added.  We still have to make at least 100 more of those calls in order to talk to every person who had their first-day appointments already and are waiting for their procedures or pills next week. already calling As the debate over abortion shifts to the states. all eyes in Montana need to be on our own judicial branch of government.  they wrote.

The day afterActually. when people find out you re transgender ― whether you ve surgically transitioned or not ― the questions start almost immediately and they pretty much never stop. They re often deeply personal questions ― ones you would never dream of asking a cisgender (non-trans) person. but because society typically treats trans bodies as public property. we don t receive the privacy or dignity that everyone else receives.Even if these inquiries come from a place of genuine compassion or curiosity. being trans can be an incredibly painful and traumatic experience. and when trans people are asked invasive. often quite rude questions by people who have no right to the answers. it only exacerbates that pain and trauma. That said. I understand the curiosity that drives these questions. I really do. I understand why it can all seem a bit confusing at first. And because I believe that if there s a silver bullet for prejudice. ignorance and hate. it s education. I ve decided to set the record straight. once and for all. from start to finish. No holds barred. No punches pulled. I will be completely honest about what I went through and how things changed when I came out the other side.I m going to do my best to answer these questions so that maybe people will stop asking them. Of course. everyone s transition is different. and every experience of GCS is unique. Everyone has their own story. This is mine. neverI also had to choose a surgeon. After an exhaustive search. I chose Dr. Chettawut Tulayaphanich. who specializes in treating gender dysphoric patients and who came highly recommended by my endocrinologist. While there are surgeons in Australia who offer GCS. surgeons overseas. particularly in Thailand. tend to be more affordable and have more experience with the procedure. After that. all my travel documents had to be lined up — no mean feat when you re halfway through legally changing your name. I had to undergo a battery of physical. blood and STD tests. My results were then emailed to the clinic overseas. Around this time. I also had to stop taking my HRT until after the surgery. If you ve ever been through puberty or menopause. you know how awful sudden hormonal shifts can be. By the end of it all. I was physically and emotionally exhausted. and the hardest part hadn t even begun yet.My surgery was scheduled for Friday. May 25. 2018. Between the flights. the hotel and the surgery itself. the bill came to about $20.000 AUD. I landed in Bangkok at 2:00 a.m. on the Sunday before my surgery. The following week was a barrage of more tests. consultations and preparation for what was to come. On Tuesday. I was ordered to fast until Friday.hereThe most common method for creating a neo-vagina is a  penile inversion  technique where the genitals are. just as the name implies. inverted. In my case. the procedure was a little more complicated. Rather than being inverted outright. the genitals are removed and then reutilized to create different parts of the neo-vagina. The vaginal lining is made up of scrotal tissue and groin skin grafts. Because of this. unlike many other post-op trans women. my vagina can self-lubricate thanks to the preservation of certain secretory glands around the urethral and vaginal opening. Penile and prepuce skin was used to construct an anatomically accurate labia minora. The result is a vagina that looks and functions. sans periods and childbirth. more or less identically to that of a cis woman.On the day of the operation. a car picked me up from my hotel and took me to the clinic. I surrendered my clothes and my phone and lay down on a gurney and waited to be wheeled into the operating theater. You may not believe me. but at that moment. I wasn t scared ― not even a little bit. Maybe I was too exhausted to be afraid. Or maybe it was because I would rather have died on that operating table than go on living in the body into which I d been born. At 2:58 p.m.. the nurses wheeled me into the operating theater. and the anesthesiologist placed a breathing mask on my face. I remember making a bad joke about the taste of the gas in my mouth as the lights went dim and I drifted into unconsciousness.When I woke up. everything was a blur. The voices I heard sounded like they were far away. and I could feel the hands of the nurses on my body as they moved me from the operating table to a gurney. I felt absolutely nothing between my legs. I couldn t move or speak.They wheeled me to a small room outside the operating theater. and someone said something about checking on me later. Then I was left alone in the dark. I remember feeling thirsty. and I found myself struggling to breathe. Every breath felt too shallow. like I couldn t get enough air into my lungs. I drifted in and out of sleep. content to simply lie still in the dark. At that point. there was no pain ― that came later.The next day. I was moved to my own room and finally given water to drink. After that. I was gradually allowed to start eating again. Soon. the pain started. At first. it was a dull ache. but within 24 hours. it had become an unbearable agony that radiated out from the surgery site up through my entire abdomen. I spent three or four days at the clinic before being moved back to my hotel. My daily routine consisted of taking several different kinds of painkillers and antibiotics at breakfast. lunch. dinner and bedtime. and watching a lot of Netflix to ease the boredom in between my doses. The idea was to medicate me enough so that I would be comfortable during the day and sleep through the night. but the painkillers always wore off too quickly. Each night became a grueling marathon of agony. and I would wait. desperate for the morning ― and my next set of pills ― to arrive.I slept in stops and starts during the day. when the pills softened my excruciating pain into a strong but bearable ache. I cried at least once a day when I was alone. sometimes from the pain. sometimes from missing my partner. who was waiting for me back home in Sydney. Often. I found myself crying for no reason at all. Each day. I was visited by nurses from the clinic. After about a week. I was told it was time for me to start dilation. For the uninitiated. when a seven-inch hole is created in your body. your body treats it like a wound and tries to close it up. Obviously. that would defeat the purpose of GCS. so the vagina is kept open using glass cylinders called dilators. I was given five of them. numbered zero to four. all about eight inches long. ranging from one and a half centimeters to about one and a half inches in width. Thanks to the technique my surgeon used. my vagina was able to accommodate a little more than seven inches in depth. Many trans women get five inches. sometimes even less. It all comes down to the skill of the surgeon. how diligent you are about sticking to your dilation schedule. and luck.The process began with the nurses performing the dilation. and after that. it would be up to me. That first time. when the gauze packing was taken out of my vagina and that first. narrow glass rod (about the width of a large pen) was placed inside me. I lay back on the bed and caught my breath as I stared at the ceiling. It hurt a little. but not as much as I d expected.The sensation of something being inside my new vagina was beyond description. The novelty. the strangeness of it. the sudden sense of my mind and body being in harmony with one another after so many years of dissonance ... I can only imagine it might compare to how Dorothy felt stepping into Oz and seeing her sepia world turn to color. For the first time. I felt the reality of my new body set in. and despite everything. at that moment. I felt utterly breathless with joy.One thing I expected after the surgery. but which nothing could have prepared me for. was the bleeding that I experienced after the gauze was removed. The amount of blood I lost over the next several months was almost unimaginable. When someone tells me I ve never had a period and therefore I can t possibly imagine what it must be like to be a  real  woman. I like to joke that I did have periods. I just got all of them at once. Every time I limped to the bathroom. a trail of blood followed me there and back. I changed my pads twice a day for a month. and every morning. the hotel staff would come and change my sheets which. despite the extra-absorptive pads I wore overnight. were soaked through with a massive pool of blood.Two weeks later. a week before I was set to return home to Australia. the nurses noticed something off about how I was healing and I had to go back under the knife.everythingBy some miracle. I was still able to go home the following week. The second surgery had gone well. and I was starting to heal properly. I could now walk short distances with the aid of a walking stick but I still needed a wheelchair at the airport to make it to the plane. It took another two months before I was even close to being fully healed. I ve since read many accounts by other trans women about what dilation was like for them. Some of them almost never have to dilate after seven or eight months. A lot of them say the pain was negligible as they continued to dilate to keep their vagina open. I wasn t so lucky. The best way I can describe dilating after I left Thailand is to liken it to inserting a serrated knife seven inches deep into an open wound and then holding it there for two and a half hours. Even now. four years later. I still need to dilate for one hour a day to maintain my depth and elasticity. The pain started to taper off after about three months. and I barely think about it now. It s as much a part of my day as brushing my teeth and taking a shower. It seems strange now to think that this isn t the body I was born into. A lot of people have made headlines ― not just recently. but for years now ― talking about GCS and transgender people more broadly. Almost all of them have one thing in common: They ve never actually been through it. I d be willing to bet they ve never even spoken to someone who has. I have been through it ― and it was harder than words could ever describe. It was terrifying. It was expensive. And it was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I say this to all readers. but especially to any who might be thinking about undergoing GCS themselves: It doesn t fix everything. When you re finally healed and you go back to your day-to-day life. you re still. at your core. the same person you were before GCS. You don t live the rest of your life in a state of perpetual bliss. But what did change for me is that now. when I look in the mirror or when I look down at my body. I see my body. not someone else s. When someone touches me. I don t flinch or feel ashamed and disgusted. When I feel the right parts between my legs. most of the time I don t feel euphoric. but I feel OK. and after a lifetime of agonizing incongruity between my body and brain. just feeling OK is absolutely priceless. So there you have it. Now. let s quickly get a few of the other more common questions out of the way: Yes. it looks like a vagina. yes. I can have vaginal sex and orgasm. no. I can t give birth. yes. it was absolutely. beyond a shadow of a doubt worth it. the brains of trans people are structurally closer to those of the gender they identify with than that of the gender they were presumed to have at birthBill Maher so crassly put itThere is no one right way to be trans. any more than there is one right way to be a cis man or woman. I needed GCS just to feel comfortable in my own body. but not everyone feels that way. and many people that do need it can t access it.It can cost $50.000 or more to undergo GCS in Australia. and for plenty of trans people — for whom rates of poverty and unemployment are significantly higher than the national average — even the $20.000 I paid (half of which my parents covered) is out of reach. It doesn t mean their gender is any less valid or that they should be treated any differently. I m incredibly grateful to have been able to undergo GCS. It s no exaggeration to say it saved my life. and the fact that it remains inaccessible to so many people who need it is heartbreaking.Gender dysphoria can be painful. and for some of us. myself included. it s unbearable without medical intervention. I m also grateful to have a family that supported me both during and after the procedure. Too many trans people (some of whom I know personally) have been either shunned or abandoned outright by unsupportive families after coming out.Everyone s experience is different. but for me and many other people. being trans is hard. even without factoring in the stigma and hate that is still so rampant in our society. But that does not mean that trans people are broken. It doesn t mean they re oddities or freaks. We re different. and different can be confusing. Different can be scary. It seems written into our DNA to be scared of what we don t understand. But the more we know. the less confusing and scary these identities and experiences become. That s why I wrote this. And there are resources available online. at your local bookstore and at LGBT community centers.Ignorance isn t a virtue. If you don t understand something. educate yourself. Research. read. and if you know a trans person and if they re comfortable with talking about their life. ask (politely). But be OK if they don t want to answer your questions. Many trans people don t. and the obligation shouldn t be on us. We re human beings and deserve to be treated as such. We deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. just like you.Elizabeth Walker is a 23-year-old trans woman living in Sydney. She studies animation and works part-time as a freelance writer.

Donald Trumpappearing since she left in January 2021Birx saidBirx did not name those officials.Throughout her testimony. Birx described a breakdown in communication and disarray in the White House COVID response.She said the belief that COVID would act like the flu in 2020 gave Americans  a false sense of security.  In addition to Trump. Birx said other administration officials  underplayed the seriousness of the pandemic.  It wasn t just the president. many of our leaders. were using words like ‘we could contain.  and you cannot contain a virus that cannot be seen.  Birx said.  And it wasn t being seen because we weren t testing. Birx also discussed theories promoted by Dr. Scott Atlas. a COVID adviser to Trump who supported herd immunity as a strategy to fight the pandemic.The committee obtained emails from Birx. including one in August 2020 in which she wrote to colleagues. including Dr. Anthony Fauci. about Altas  claims that masks were  overrated.  that testing should be limited. and that testing could hurt the president politically.according to The New York TimesBirx told the committee on Thursday that Atlas  presence  certainly destroyed any cohesion in the response in the White House. Birx also explained how the theories shared by Altas affected the pandemic response. When you no longer agree on what is actually happening in the country and what needs to be done. and there s not consensus on that. then you lose the ability to execute in the maximum efficient and effective way.  Birx continued.Asked if more lives would have been saved if the president had followed her recommendations instead of those coming from Atlas. Birx replied  absolutely.  Birx discussed the infamous press conference  I was paralyzed in that moment because it was so unexpected.  she said. I just wanted it to be ‘The Twilight Zone  and it all go away.  Birx continued.  I could just see everything unraveling in that moment. Birx s testimony comes as scientists continue learning more about the effects of COVID.showed that over 40% of U.S. adults said they had contracted COVID at some point during the pandemicnearly 20 million lives were saved by COVID vaccines according to The Associated Press,Health News
We know the importance of habits. Many people try to cultivate good ones. like eating healthier. reading more or getting more sleep.Unfortunately. sometimes we unintentionally set ourselves up for failure ― especially as it relates to sleep. What we don t always realize is that some of the things we do before bed might actually be making our Zzzs worse. We reached out to several experts to find out which of our seemingly harmless nighttime habits aren t conducive to a restful night s sleep. Here s what to avoid:We all have busy lives. and sometimes we don t get to complete our to-do lists during the daytime. In order to make up for this. we ll try to play catch up at night.This has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and can lead to poor overall sleep quality. according to Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni. an associate psychiatrist and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. So many people will spend the last few minutes of the day ‘catching up.  not only on work duties but also on household needs.  Nadkarni told HuffPost. For instance. the last 30 minutes before bedtime. people may write down lists of tasks they need to get done around the house. obligations they need to fulfill on behalf of their kids. or respond to work emails that they might have missed.  she continued.  This might feel like a version of winding down when actually. it can instigate nighttime rumination and an arousal level about additional planning for the next day. in turn. impacting sleep onset latency and worsening overall sleep quality. We know reaching for your favorite boozy beverage might sound like the perfect way to unwind from a long day. but it might also be the reason you can t stay asleep. Chelsie Rohrscheib. a sleep expert and neuroscientist at Wesper. an at-home tool for diagnosing sleep disorders and improving sleep. said while alcohol is initially sedating. it becomes problematic as it s metabolized and broken down into new chemicals by the liver.  When alcohol is broken down. it turns into a chemical that affects the sleep centers of the brain and prevents deep sleep and REM sleep. making the second half of your night more restless and causing frequent awakenings.  she said.Additionally. alcohol can cause increased urination. so you may frequently need to get up to use the bathroom. Rohrscheib recommended having your last alcoholic drink at least three or four hours before you go to sleep.Despite knowing we shouldn t. it s just so hard to resist reaching for a phone. iPad or laptop while in bed. However. Dr. Alex Dimitriu. a physician double board-certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine. urges people to try.Dimitriu explained that screens are both bright with blue light and interactive. which is wake-promoting.  I ask all my patients to ‘tech off at 10.  ideally no screens one to two hours before bedtime.  he said.  Reading is so much more conducive to good sleep than interacting with a smartphone until the last waking moment. Besides helping you get to sleep earlier. avoiding interactive or exciting stimuli before bed also works to deepen sleep throughout the night. as your brain starts to slow down before sleep. NetflixFinally. if you can t avoid screens completely. Dr. Deepti Agarwal. the director of interventional and integrative pain management at Case Integrative Health. recommended investing in a good pair of blue light glasses. If glasses aren t your style. there are also plenty of screen protectors or phone applications that block blue light. Then you can enjoy your favorite wind-down show and avoid any negative influences on your sleep.  she said.The act of doomscrolling refers to constantly scrolling through bad news on social media. But before doomscrolling. people were watching hours and hours of TV news. Both doomscrolling and  doomwatching  are harmful to your mental health. but they can also affect your sleep.Heather Turgeon and Julie Wright. sleep experts and authors of  Generation Sleepless.  both said watching news updates two hours before bedtime is a big sleep stealer.  Today s terrifying news cycle is a good example of a habit that can make falling asleep a lot harder.  they both said in an email.  If we go directly from the intense emotional stimulation of a breaking news story and all the worries it triggers in our already overactive minds. to lying down in bed and trying to sleep. we are likely to lie awake instead. It s generally recommended to avoid vigorous exercise at least 90 minutes before bedtime. While many people choose to have a late night workout routine as a way to  tire themselves out . these workouts can make for a night of restless sleep. according to Stephen Light. a certified sleep science coach. Avoid workouts that make you break a sweat an hour before bedtime.  he said.  This could be cardio. heavy lifting or high-intensity interval training. Instead opt for workouts like pilates. yoga or an evening walk if you feel the need to expend some extra energy. Workouts focused on easing muscle tension can help you avoid aches and pains that may keep you awake in discomfort. Getting good sleep requires a prelude. which means you need to create a wind-down and bedtime routine. Carley Prendergast. a certified sleep science coach and sleep expert. said wind-down routines are important in the process of preparing the mind and body for relaxation and optimal sleep.  Finding a relaxing routine will help the brain produce melatonin. eventually resulting in sleep.  she said.  One might want to look into establishing the routine of going to bed around the same time every night. This can help establish the circadian rhythm ― the body s sleep-wake cycle. Other soothing activities could include taking a warm bath. skincare. reading a book. etc. It s best to avoid foods that quickly spike your blood sugar levels before bed. Rohrscheib said. When your blood sugar is rapidly increased. it causes a blood sugar crash once it s deleted from your system.  she said.  A blood sugar crash often leads to hypoglycemia and this can wake you up in the middle of the night. If you need a snack before bed. reach for foods with a low glycemic index. like oats. which will keep your blood sugar stable throughout the night. It may be tempting to crank up the heat or keep your AC off. but warm temperatures can be detrimental to your sleep quality. The brain and body need to undergo a slight temperature drop in order to initiate and maintain sleep. According to Rohrscheib.  when we are too warm. our body has to work harder to cool us down and keep us cool. and this is very disruptive to sleep. Try to maintain your bedroom temperature between 66 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In the summer months. use fans. crack windows. or use cooling technologies like a cooling pad to reduce the chance of overheating.  The amount of time we allot for sleep should be similar to our average nightly sleep duration. Reed said. This means that if you typically get about seven hours of sleep each night. it s best not to allot much more than around seven-and-a-half or eight hours in bed. Many people who struggle with sleep allot too much time for sleep as a way of trying to get more sleep.  he said.  This sounds logical — after all. if you spend more time in bed there is more opportunity for sleep. But spending more time in bed if you re already struggling to sleep can be counterproductive. If you are already struggling with sleep. then spending more time in bed will simply lead to more time awake in bed rather than more time asleep.  Reed said.  This leads to more tossing and turning during the night. and more worry. stress and anxiety related to being awake in bed. Over time. this creates an association between the bed. worry. and wakefulness — rather than sleep and relaxation. This makes sleep more difficult. Finally. doubling your bedroom as an office space could be contributing to your sleepless nights.  When we use our bedroom as an office. we re creating an association with wakefulness.  said Morgan Adams. a holistic sleep coach for women.  Our beds should be a cue for sleep so working in our beds weakens this association. If you ve been working from your bed all day it could be harder for you to fall asleep since you might have trouble turning off your ‘working brain.  ,Health News
Nearly 20 million lives were saved by COVID-19 vaccines during their first year. but even more deaths could have been prevented if international targets for the shots had been reached. researchers reported Thursday.received the first shotpersisting inequities Catastrophic would be the first word that comes to mind.  Watson said of the outcome if vaccines hadn t been available to fight the coronavirus. The findings  quantify just how much worse the pandemic could have been if we did not have these vaccines. The researchers used data from 185 countries to estimate that vaccines prevented 4.2 million COVID-19 deaths in India. 1.9 million in the United States. 1 million in Brazil. 631.000 in France and 507.000 in the United Kingdom.study published ThursdayThe main finding — 19.8 million COVID-19 deaths were prevented — is based on estimates of how many more deaths than usual occurred during the time period. Using only reported COVID-19 deaths. the same model yielded 14.4 million deaths averted by vaccines.The London scientists excluded China because of uncertainty around the pandemic s effect on deaths there and its huge population.The study has other limitations. The researchers did not include how the virus might have mutated differently in the absence of vaccines. And they did not factor in how lockdowns or mask wearing might have changed if vaccines weren t available.Another modeling group used a different approach to estimate that 16.3 million COVID-19 deaths were averted by vaccines. That work. by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. has not been published.In the real world. people wear masks more often when cases are surging. said the institute s Ali Mokdad. and 2021′s delta wave without vaccines would have prompted a major policy response. We may disagree on the number as scientists. but we all agree that COVID vaccines saved lots of lives.  Mokdad said.The findings underscore both the achievements and the shortcomings of the vaccination campaign. said Adam Finn of Bristol Medical School in England. who like Mokdad was not involved in the study. Although we did pretty well this time — we saved millions and millions of lives — we could have done better and we should do better in the future.  Finn said.Funding came from several groups including the WHO. the UK Medical Research Council. Gavi. the Vaccine Alliance. and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.___AP health and science reporter Havovi Todd contributed.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

ATTICA. N.Y. (AP) — A New York man and woman face fines of $500 each after they took a raccoon to a pet store to shop for food and a store worker ratted them out. authorities said.A state Department of Environmental Conservation police officer got an urgent call from the Erie County Department of Health about a potentially rabid raccoon on June 2. the DEC said in a news release.The health department said a couple had brought a raccoon to a pet store for food and supplies and a store employee contacted authorities. Raccoons are considered dangerous wild animals because they are known to carry and transmit the deadly rabies virus.The DEC officer used store surveillance video. a store-issued rewards card and license plate information to locate the couple in the town of Attica in western New York. the department said. The owners turned the raccoon over and were each charged with unlawfully possessing a wild animal. which is subject to $500 fine. authorities said.The raccoon that was confiscated from the couple was euthanized and tested for rabies — a test that can only be performed on an animal after it has died. The test was negative. the DEC said.,Health News

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials on Thursday ordered Juul to pull its electronic cigarettes from the U.S. market. the latest blow to the embattled company widely blamed for sparking a national surge in teen vaping.The action is part of a sweeping effort by the Food and Drug Administration to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping industry after years of regulatory delays.Parents. politicians and anti-tobacco advocates wanted a ban on the devices that many blame for the rise in underage vaping. Supporters say they can help smokers cut back on regular cigarettes.The FDA noted that Juul may have played a  disproportionate″ role in the rise in teen vaping and its application didn t have enough evidence to show that marketing its products  would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. The agency has granted some e-cigarette applications. Since last fall. the agency has given its OK to tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes from R.J. Reynolds. Logic and other companies.But industry players and anti-tobacco advocates have complained that those products account for just a tiny percent of the $6 billion vaping market in the U.S.Regulators repeatedly delayed making decisions on devices from market leaders. including Juul. which remains the best-selling vaping brand although sales have dipped.Last year. the agency rejected applications for more than a million other e-cigarettes and related products. mainly due to their potential appeal to underage teens.To stay on the market. companies must show that their products benefit public health. In practice. that means proving that adult smokers who use the products are likely to quit or reduce their smoking. while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.E-cigarettes first appeared in the U.S. more than a decade ago with the promise of providing smokers a less harmful alternative. The devices heat a nicotine solution into a vapor that s inhaled. bypassing many of the toxic chemicals produced by burning tobacco.But studies have reached conflicting results about whether they truly help smokers quit. And efforts by the FDA to rule on vaping products and their claims were repeatedly slowed by industry lobbying and competing political interests.The vaping market grew to include hundreds of companies selling an array of devices and nicotine solutions in various flavors and strengths.The vaping issue took on new urgency in 2018 when Juul s high-nicotine. fruity-flavored cartridges quickly became a nationwide craze among middle and high school students. The company faces a slew of federal and state investigations into its early marketing practices. which included distributing free Juul products at concerts and parties hosted by young influencers.In 2019. the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating its fruit and dessert flavors. The next year. the FDA limited flavors in small vaping devices to just tobacco and menthol. Separately. Congress raised the purchase age for all tobacco and vaping products to 21.But the question of whether e-cigarettes should remain on the market at all remained.The FDA has been working under a court order to render its decisions. anti-tobacco groups successfully sued the agency to speed up its review.FDA regulators warned companies for years they would have to submit rigorous. long-term data showing a clear benefit for smokers who switch to vaping. But all but the largest e-cigarette manufacturers have resisted conducting that kind of expensive. time-consuming research.While Juul remains a top seller. a recent federal survey shows that teen have been shifting away from the company. Last year s survey showed Juul was the fourth most popular e-cigarette among high schoolers who regularly vape. The most popular brand was a disposable e-cigarette called Puff Bar that comes in flavors like pink lemonade. strawberry and mango. That company s disposable e-cigarettes had been able to skirt regulation because they use synthetic nicotine. which until recently was outside the FDA s jurisdiction. Congress recently closed that loophole.Overall. the survey showed a drop of nearly 40% in the teen vaping rate as many kids were forced to learn from home during the pandemic. Still. federal officials cautioned about interpreting the results given they were collected online for the first time. instead of in classrooms.The brainchild of two Stanford University students. Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market. Juul. which is partially owned by tobacco giant Altria. still accounts for nearly 50% of the U.S. e-cigarette market. It once controlled more than 75%.On Tuesday. the FDA also laid out plans to establish a maximum nicotine level for certain tobacco products to reduce their addictiveness. In that announcement. the agency also noted that it has invested in a multimedia public education campaign aimed at warning young people about the potential risks of e-cigarette use.___AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

according to a new studyData collected from June 1 to June 13 by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyzed by the CDC s National Center for Health Statistics showed that over 40% of U.S. adults said they had contracted COVID at some point during the pandemic. Of those. one in five continue suffering from  long COVID. The Household Pulse Survey defined  long COVID  as symptoms a patient was not experiencing before testing positive that lingered for three months or more after the initial infection. 20-minute online surveyWomen. for example. had a higher chance of suffering from long-lasting symptoms than men. and older adults were less likely to experience  long COVID  than younger adults. In addition. nearly 9% of Hispanic adults had  long COVID.  compared with 7.5% of non-Hispanic whites and 6.8% of Black Americans.The survey also found bisexual and transgender adults are more likely to experience long-haul symptoms than adults of other sexual orientations and identities. Specifically. 12% of bisexual adults are suffering from  long COVID.  compared with 7% of straight. gay and lesbian adults. The prevalence of  long COVID  also varied by state. with Kentucky.

Last week. President Joe Biden signed an executive order to end federal funding for LGBTQ+ conversion therapy. the therapy I endured in my 20s that left me contemplating suicide. I can t remember a time when I didn t know I was different. even before I heard the word  gay.  I wore a ballerina leotard and red tutu when I was 5. in 1960s Selma. Indiana. I was practically an alien. beamed down to the cornfields from some exotic drag planet.My well-intentioned parents. homophobic before that word even hit Indiana. didn t know what to do with me. I was a bright-eyed. precocious. singing. dancing dervish with no interest in sports. Hot Wheels or toy guns. They hoped I d grow out of it.I learned the label for what I was when I snuck into my father s bathroom to read the 1969 bestseller  Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex: But Were Afraid to Ask.  I devoured every lurid detail about these so-called  homosexuals  and the tragic. furtive lives they were doomed to lead. It was cold comfort. but at Ieast I finally knew there were others out there like me. even if we could never be happy.The childhood campaign to make me a Real Boy included forced work as a dairy farm hand when I was 6. military summer camp at 10. and spending sixth grade exiled to Nazareth Hall Catholic Military school. As my father hetero-splained. the discipline there would  cut the apron strings.  i.e.. make me not gay. What it really made me was full of anger. afraid of straights and fiercely distrustful of authority figures and organized religion. It was also a perfect introduction to the cruelty and bullying to come in school and in real life every time our community is trotted out to be demonized (for example. by Ron DeSantis and his  Don t Say Gay bill.  etc.). I renounced the Straight White Male Patriarchy even before I knew those words.My adult conversion therapy was triggered when my sister Nikki died unexpectedly following an epileptic seizure. She was 24 and I was 21. just finishing my junior year of college. Our already-dysfunctional family was both broken and broken open by her death. I d already come out officially. attending the first-ever National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights at 19. one of the proudest. most transformative events of my life. I chose a national stage to exit my closet. never to reenter it. Or so I thought. Most people hear  conversion therapy  and think of organizations like Exodus International. Sham counselors and therapists in private practice can be just as dangerous. Enter Bea. the architect of my conversion therapy. My parents met Ecuadorian expats Bea and her husband Carlos while flirting with learning Spanish. hoping to become missionaries somewhere. I met Bea the summer before my senior year of college. Bea was a therapist. and even more so than my parents. deeply religious. She was also one of the most fascinating. funny and entertaining people I d ever encountered. a bubbly confection of Charo and Dr. Ruth. She was so fun to be around. It totally escaped me that behind her funny stories. she was studying me like a lab rat. Once. she invited me over to meet a boy and girl my age under the guise of a casual social gathering. Years later. I discovered each was undergoing conversion therapy. and I was there like a freak in a sideshow. modeling the  before  they were each trying to leave behind while she helped them achieve their heteronormative  after. Days before moving in with my first boyfriend. Ken. friends of my parents threw a dinner party to celebrate our new life together. and Bea attended. I didn t realize the real reason for the party was for Bea to find a way to invite Ken and me over the next day to launch my conversion therapy.The next day. we sat at her table and she asked us some questions. She had us each draw a figure. give it an age and name. and write down what the figure was feeling. Based solely on that. she delivered her pronouncement: I was not gay.According to Bea. I chose to be gay when I was 14 and needed a strong male role model. If my life were balanced and I had the chance to choose again. I would choose to be straight. Finally. even if I was gay. I couldn t have picked a worse partner for myself than Ken.Lying on the blue carpeting in my parent s living room. sobbing with grief and confusion. feeling the most betrayed and violated I d ever felt. I vowed never to see her again. Ken and I left the next day to start our lives together. still stunned by what had happened.My fall quarter flew by. Ken and I barely made it to Christmas before breaking up. we were so haunted by Bea s words. The one time I saw my parents. they came to see me in a production of  Sweeney Todd  and tagging along was Bea. the last person in the world I wanted to see. Bea apologized to me for her words the previous summer. She only wanted to be friends. She encouraged me to tape my feelings and send them to her if I wanted her counsel on anything. Back at school. I made one cassette tape about my feelings during winter quarter. I still didn t know what to make of Bea or how to proceed to be around her. The thing was. I truly needed and wanted therapy. I just didn t know how to separate the parts I needed from the parts I didn t. A childhood spent raising your alcoholic parents and being bullied doesn t usually lead to strong boundary-setting skills.During spring break. I saw Bea every day for eight hours. She made her case against homosexuality — how it wasn t natural and couldn t be found anywhere in nature. She wore me down with biblical passages for every one of my challenges. We did hypnosis and desensitization and aversion exercises. I returned to college for my last quarter a preemie-heterosexual. hoping the right exercises and prayers would make it stick. I cut all contact with my gay friends and classmates. I even had sex with a close girl friend. I moved to NYC. still pretending to be straight — but in truth. asexual. deeply wounded and totally confused.I spent the next five years trying to maintain the pretense. ignoring my unhappiness and loneliness. Things finally erupted with Bea when I moved back to Indiana and continued therapy with her. I challenged her one day about the private information she indiscreetly shared with me about other clients of hers I knew. wondering what she told them about me. She burst into tears. and I left. totally freaked out and unsure of what to do next. That was the last time I saw her.A couple of years later. I mustered the courage to call a national radio call-in show to tell my story to psychiatrist Dr. Harvey Ruben. He took a deep breath. sighed. and I could hear the sadness in his voice as he offered a deeply compassionate apology for what had been done to me in the name of therapy. He informed me that I had been the victim of serious psychological and sexual abuse. and he shared his hope that someday I could trust another therapist enough to seek help. I hung up the phone and burst into tears. feeling heard and validated for the first time in my 30 years. the first ray of hope that I might find a way back to my true self someday.I eventually saw a miraculous therapist (did I ever rake him across the coals during our first session). I came out again. I became a certified therapist myself. and I moved back to NYC. ostensibly to perform. but really for the gay finishing school I sorely needed. It took me 15 years before I was able to fully explore my authentic sexuality. in my 40s.I confronted my fears about sex and my extremely negative body image. I became a body worker. pleasure activist and sex educator— for 20 years. women (and a few men) have paid me to teach them how to give great head (and their boyfriends have thanked me!). I m 61 now. Eleven years ago. I moved to Madrid to marry my husband. a loving. beautiful man who is also a National Living Cultural Treasure of Spain as a flamenco dancer. We live in the world s largest gay neighborhood in a country that celebrates diversity and inclusivity. I launched my first music video as DaddyB. a daddy bear singer/dancer/songwriter. I ve fully embraced the richness of my history and my place as a gay elder. I am both a warrior and a lover on behalf of my community.I wish I could say what I went through is a relic of the past. but it s not. For every parent who celebrates their child s diversity. there are hundreds who support the anti-gay laws being proposed in 20 states. Twenty-nine states don t fully protect queer Americans from discrimination. Texas Republicans just approved a platform that labels homosexuality  an abnormal lifestyle choice.  Gay marriage is still illegal on the books in Indiana and in many other states.Still. Biden s executive order against conversion therapy is an extraordinary declaration on behalf of LGBTQ+ people. It brings tears to my eyes when I think of how it could ve helped me. It also gives me great hope for the LGBTQ+ youth now and in the future. that they may always be allowed to be their authentic selves.

For Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.). a former Planned Parenthood executive and strong proponent of women s reproductive rights. it s infuriating enough that the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.So last week. during a committee hearing on a bill about Food and Drug Administration user fees. when Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) casually tried to amend the bill to require women to see a doctor and get an ultrasound before being allowed to use the abortion pill. Smith was livid. Completely unnecessary.  she told him in Tuesday s hearing. This amendment would force women who are seeking a medication abortion to be diagnosed in person and only after this unnecessary procedure.  she said.  To be clear. these kinds of [transvaginal] ultrasounds do not have a medical purpose within 10 weeks of pregnancy. which is the time frame for when women are able to access a medication abortion. Smith tweeted about it after the hearing. too. saying there is  zero  reason for Marshall s proposal and accusing him of  punishing women for seeking a common medical procedure. That could have been the end of it. After all. Smith was right: Medication abortion. also called the abortion pill. was approved by the FDA in 2000 and is safe. effective and widely prescribed for miscarriage and abortion care within the first 10 weeks. It s also the most common method of abortion in the country. accounting for about 60% of all abortions.As of December. women don t even have to go to a doctor s office to get the two-pill regimen. The FDA waived that rule to let doctors prescribe it through telehealth consultations and mail it to patients in states where it s permitted by law. That was just before a March study found that medication abortion can be dispensed without an ultrasound or a physical exam. a study with far-reaching implications given that uBut Marshall. who likes to tout that he s the Senate s only OB-GYN. tweeted back at Smith — this time making an outlandish claim about the dangers of the abortion pill. Women will die if they skip this step.  Marshall said. referring to an ultrasound.  and babies will be born with birth defects as the drug is less effective at a later gestational age. Dying women! Babies with birth defects! This is outrageous!It s also not true.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. the premier professional organization for OB-GYNs. responded to HuffPost s request for comment almost immediately when asked about Marshall s claims. ACOG does not support this statement.  said Kate Connors. a spokeswoman for the organization.  Medication abortion is safe and effective. and evidence shows it can be provided safety and effectively through telehealth. let alone without an ultrasound. ACOG s official guidance on medication abortionsafer than Tylenol Sen. Marshall is an OB-GYN. He knows what the standard is.  she told HuffPost in a recent interview. accusing him of  hiding behind his doctor s degree  to try to scare women away from getting a safe abortion. The Minnesota Democrat said it s important to note the context of Marshall s claims. He s doing this as we are probably days away from the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. and many will be turning to medication abortion as a way of accessing abortion.  Smith said.  He s trying to make that difficult. too … as we think about the future of abortion care where Roe v. Wade is overturned. Asked for comment in response to ACOG and Smith saying his claims about abortion medication are wildly untrue. a Marshall spokesman provided a lengthy statement about the senator being a proud OB-GYN. I will always be an OBGYN first.  Marshall said in his emailed statement.  When I see political agendas that will harm patients it s my obligation to speak up. The Kansas senator went on to claim that women taking an abortion pill without first getting an ultrasound  will lead to missed ectopic pregnancies and woman [sic] dying.  He also claimed that without getting ultrasounds first. women will get the pills beyond the approved 70-day window. which he said could cause  significant birth defects. as well as lead to delay in prenatal care and higher rates of undiagnosed diabetes. blood clots. and preeclampsia.  As an OBGYN for 30 years. I delivered more than 5.000 babies but I also treated hemorrhaging patients in the ER that resulted from failed terminations.  Marshall said. before touting his medical credentials again.  As one of only four physicians in the U.S Senate and the only OBGYN. it is in the best interest for the safety and wellbeing of women and unborn children to require medical imaging prior to prescribing chemical abortion pills. Once again. ACOG strongly rejected Marshall s claims.explicitly called that outBeyond that. Dr. Jen Villavicencio. ACOG s leader of equity transformation and an OB-GYN with a specialty in complex family planning. said Marshall s claims are downright dangerous for women. If anything will cost the lives of pregnant people. it will be the gross and deliberate misinterpretation of scientific data to restrict access to abortion based on politics and ideology.  Villavicencio told HuffPost in a statement. As a doctor who is currently delivering babies. operating on people with life-threatening ectopics. and providing abortion care. I can say both policies and the practice of medicine should reflect sound science and clear evidence.  she said.  Abortion restrictions are clearly not supported by data. Medication abortion is a very safe. effective medical intervention and for many people. requiring ultrasounds only serve as a barrier to care.  will conclude its term,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. on Saturday opened COVID-19 vaccines to infants. toddlers and preschoolers.The shots will become available next week. expanding the nation s vaccination campaign to children as young as 6 months.Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the vaccines for the littlest children. and the final signoff came hours later from Dr. Rochelle Walensky. the agency s director. We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated. and with today s decision. they can.  Walensky said in a statement.While the Food and Drug Administration approves vaccines. it s the CDC that decides who should get them.The shots offer young children protection from hospitalization. death and possible long-term complications that are still not clearly understood. the CDC s advisory panel said.millions of doses orderedRoughly 18 million kids will be eligible. but it remains to be seen how many will ultimately get the vaccines. Less than a third of children ages 5 to 11 have done so since vaccination opened up to them last November.Here are some things to know:WHAT KINDS ARE AVAILABLE?Two brands — Pfizer and Moderna — got the green light Friday from the FDAPfizer s vaccine is for children 6 months to 4 years old. The dose is one-tenth of the adult dose. and three shots are needed. The first two are given three weeks apart. and the last at least two months later.Moderna s is two shots. each a quarter of its adult dose. given about four weeks apart for kids 6 months through 5 years old. The FDA also approved a third dose. at least a month after the second shot. for children with immune conditions that make them more vulnerable to serious illness.HOW WELL DO THEY WORK?In studies. vaccinated youngsters developed levels of virus-fighting antibodies as strong as young adults. suggesting that the kid-size doses protect against coronavirus infections.However. exactly how well they work is hard to pin down. especially when it comes to the Pfizer vaccine.Two doses of Moderna appeared to be only about 40% effective at preventing milder infections at a time when the omicron variant was causing most COVID-19 illnesses. Pfizer presented study information suggesting the company saw 80% with its three shots. But the Pfizer data was so limited — and based on such a small number of cases — that experts and federal officials say they don t feel there is a reliable estimate yet.SHOULD MY LITTLE ONE BE VACCINATED?Yes. according to the CDC s advisers. While COVID-19 has been the most dangerous for older adults. younger people. including children. can also get very sick.Hospitalizations surged during the omicron wave. Since the start of the pandemic. about 480 children under age 5 are counted among the nation s more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths. according to federal data. It is worth vaccinating even though the number of deaths are relatively rare. because these deaths are preventable through vaccination.  said Dr. Matthew Daley. a Kaiser Permanente Colorado researcher who sits on the CDC s advisory committee.WHICH VACCINE SHOULD MY CHILD GET?Either one. said Dr. Peter Marks. the FDA s vaccine chief. Whatever vaccine your health care provider. pediatrician has. that s what I would give my child.   Marks said Friday.The doses haven t been tested against each other. so experts say there s no way to tell if one is better.One consideration: It takes roughly three months to complete the Pfizer three-shot series. but just one month for Moderna s two shots. So families eager to get children protected quickly might want Moderna.WHO S GIVING THE SHOTS?Pediatricians. other primary care physicians and children s hospitals are planning to provide the vaccines. Limited drugstores will offer them for at least some of the under-5 group.U.S. officials expect most shots to take place at pediatricians  offices. Many parents may be more comfortable getting the vaccine for their kids at their regular doctor. White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said. He predicted the pace of vaccination will be far slower than it was for older populations. We re going see vaccinations ramp up over weeks and even potentially over a couple of months.  Jha said.CAN CHILDREN GET OTHER VACCINES AT THE SAME TIME?It s common for little kids to get more than one vaccine during a doctor s visit.In studies of the Moderna and Pfizer shots in infants and toddlers. other vaccinations were not given at the same time so there is no data on potential side effects when that happens.But problems have not been identified in older children or adults when COVID-19 shots and other vaccinations were given together. and the CDC is advising that it s safe for younger children as well.WHAT IF MY CHILD RECENTLY HAD COVID-19?About three-quarters of childrenExperts have noted re-infections among previously infected people and say the highest levels of protection occur in those who were both vaccinated and previously infected.The CDC has said people may consider waiting about three months after an infection to be vaccinated.___Associated Press writer Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Our bodies produce all kinds of substances. and people have different tolerance levels for them. One that can be really bothersome is earwax. But believe it or not. this substance actually serves a purpose ― and you need to be careful when it comes to removing it. Below. experts break down what you need to know about dealing with earwax and cleaning out your ears. Most people do not need to remove their ear wax.  said Dr. Erich P. Voigt. an associate professor in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.  It is a protective coating of the ear canal. It is a waterproofing agent and has anti-microbial properties. It helps prevent outer ear infections. parts of the body Think from an evolutionary standpoint.  said Dr. Lawrence R. Lustig. chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.  If Mother Nature designed an ear that had to be cleaned. that would be a poor design. We didn t have ear cleaners 500.000 years ago. He described the system as a  conveyer belt of skin.  Earwax is a combination of skin and oil.  Lustig said.  Skin migrates out from the eardrum to the outside of the ear canal. and as those migrating dead skin cells mix with the oil glands of the ear canal on the way out. that s where you get earwax. Some people have a migration problem. produce too much wax or wax of an abnormal consistency. They might be prone to wax infections and require medical intervention to remove their earwax. which can block the ear and impair hearing. But for most of us. the wax clears out naturally as we go about our daily lives.   has a dance moveBut pop culture fans might also remember that brutal scene from  Girls  when Hannah inserts a Q-tip too far into her ear and accidentally punctures her eardrum. The packaging for Q-tip products today even contains a clear warning:  Do not insert inside the ear canal. Indeed. cotton swabs like Q-tips can scratch the ear canal and cause bleeding or even lead to ear drum damage. Bottom line: Cleaning out your ears with Q-tips is not a good idea.  Think about diameter of ear canal and diameter of Q-tips.  Lustig said.  If you can t see what you re doing. you can end up sort of packing all that wax in with a Q-tips. A lot of the time it acts as a plunger. When I have someone come in with an earwax infection. half the time it s because they used Q-tips. In addition to packing the wax deeper and potentially causing it to get trapped in the ear. cleaning out your ears with Q-tips can lead to outer ear infections.  Stripping the wax out of the canal can also leave the skin dry. and dry skin can get itchy.  Block added.  This leads to a cycle of using cotton swabs to clean out the wax. which makes them itch. so then you scratch with cotton swabs. which makes them itch. etc. And bad news if you prefer using ear candles: In addition to causing other forms of potential harm. this method doesn t seem to work.  There have actually been studies to see the amount of wax that comes out.  Lustig said.  It doesn t seem to help at all. and there s the risk of burning your ear doing it. It was trendy for awhile. but I think that trend has worn off ― though I m sure ear candles will eventually arise from the dead like Lazarus. If you re still wanting to clean your ears. just focus on the outside area and any wax that s already on its way out.  My general recommendation for people is let the body do its job.  Lustig said.  Let that skin migration with the wax come out on its own. Take a wet washrag onto your finger and clean out whatever comes to the entry point. Both Block and Voigt recommended simply letting the normal showering and hair washing process clean the area. Just wipe the outside with a soapy finger or washcloth.  Block said. There are also products like Debrox drops. which contain carbamide peroxide (a combination of hydrogen peroxide and urea) to help dissolve the earwax.  I ll often use that or straight up hydrogen peroxide.  Lustig said.  Hydrogen peroxide softens up those harder blocks. It s safe to use assuming you don t have a hole in your eardrum. which most people don t. Sometimes the wax is really hard and we can use these mini tweezers called alligator forceps to clear it out. Sometimes it s really soften and we suction it out. To clean out the ear with a solution like Debrox (or a similar solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. for instance). be sure follow the instructions on the product. Generally. the process involves lying on your side. administering a few drops. waiting a few minutes and then sitting up and blotting the area. You can then generally use warm water in the shower to flush out the ear. Still. as previously noted you really don t need to clean out your earwax unless there s a problem ― and even then. it s best to have a medical professional handle the process.  The ear canal is sensitive and has a lot of nerve endings.  Lustig said.  A light touch that might feel like a tickle elsewhere can really hurt in the ear. So I wouldn t go putting things in there. And you have to be careful when irrigating the ear not to perforate the eardrum. You have to be careful to direct the jet of fluid in the correct location on the back wall.  You re not likely to experience issues with wax buildup. but if you do. be sure to seek professional help. When your ear canal gets blocked. you may feel like you have an earplug in all the time. experience difficulty hearing or feel like your voice is echoing when you talk. Doctors can help clear out the wax and check for other issues. Lustig noted that what some people suspect to be wax infection can actually be a bigger problem.  I ve had patients come to see me with sudden hearing loss. and when I look in the ear. it s clear and there s no problem with the eardrum.  he said.  It turned out a virus got into the inner ear and caused inner ear damage.  If you ever notice a sudden change in hearing. you should make an appointment with a professional as soon as possible.  There are several things that can arise in the ear with a change in hearing that are worrisome or dangerous.  Lustig said.  And there s a limited time window to treat it. Some other things that can mimic hearing loss are much more dangerous. ,Health News
This article is part of a larger series titled  The End Of Roe.  Head here to read more.bombshell draft opinionthe Supreme Court has now overturned Roe v. Wadethe death penaltyBut the scope of the Supreme Court s decision has implications well beyond abortion. Many advocates have expressed concerns that the ruling will pave the way for more women to be prosecuted based on actions during their pregnancy. especially if they miscarry.National Advocates for Pregnant Women. or NAPWThe American College of Obstet­ri­cians and Gyneco­lo­gists defines the criminalization of pregnancy as  the punishing or penalizing of individuals for actions that are interpreted as harmful to their own pregnancies. including enforcement of laws that punish actions during pregnancy that would not otherwise be criminal or punishable. In recent years. there have been a large number of headline-making cases of women who were prosecuted in the U.S. after experiencing a miscarriage or stillbirth.19-year-old Brittney Poolaw An overzealous prosecutor blamed Brittney for the demise of her fetus without scientific backing.  Malik said. noting that the medical examiner s report cited multiple factors contributed to the miscarriage ― including a congenital abnormality. placental abruption and chorioamnionitis.  What the state is doing in Oklahoma and elsewhere is they re blaming. charging and jailing these women for their miscarriages and stillbirths.  Malik said.  We know of nine other open cases in Oklahoma where women are being criminalized in relation to their pregnancies or pregnancy outcomes. Instead of empathy or medical care. the state employs this punitive. harsh and honestly inhumane response to pregnancy loss. Adora Perez of Hanford. CaliforniaHanford resident Chelsea Beckermore than 400 pregnant women From our research. we know that people with capacity for pregnancy can and will become targets by the state for criminal prosecution. legal surveillance and civil detention if Roe is off the books.  Malik said.  We ve already documented more than 1.700 cases since Roe. and that s likely an undercount. The rate has rapidly increased in a short amount of time. Although most of these cases involve drug use. there are plenty of examples of pregnant people facing arrest and detention due to other behaviors or events. Alabama resident Marshae Jonesa Tennessee woman was reportedly arrestedBei Bei Shuai was chargedThe NAPW s dataGrace Howardafter eating poppyseed cakeHoward noted that people have been threatened with removal of their children for refusing to comply with  arguably unnecessary medical interventions  during their pregnancies as well. Adults with a sound mind are allowed to reject medical treatment ― I guess unless you re pregnant.  she said.  And if you re not pregnant and test positive for illegal drugs at the hospital. we don t incarcerate you for that. But if you re pregnant. we do. up to 20% of known pregnanciesWhen it comes to pregnant people who use drugs. they tend to have a number of other risk factors for pregnancy complications ― including poverty. homelessness. poor nutrition. smoking and other health issues.protect vulnerable pregnant people from violence from others What makes this issue so gruesome and awful is that depending on the political and legal climate of the state. states criminalize and punish families differently.  Malik said.  You ll see a rogue prosecutor expanding an already existing law to include a fertilized egg. embryo or fetus as a human being and then use this interpretation of fetal personhood to criminally charge a pregnant person for perceived harm to the fetus. She pointed to the example of Alabama and its chemical endangerment law. The legislature first passed this law to criminalize people who were exposing their living children to meth labs that they were creating in their homes.  Malik said.  But over time that statute was expanded to include fetuses. So now when a pregnant person in Alabama admits to using a substance or there s an indication of substance use in a toxicology report ― or even an allegation of substance abuse while pregnant ― they can be arrested and charged with chemical endangerment.  Low-income women and women of color are disproportionately targeted in the criminalization of pregnancy. are more likelyShe noted that even within the same state. certain counties are more likely to report and arrest people for pregnancy-related charges.  The thing that s really alarming to me is even with Roe in place. there have been thousands of arrests of people for crimes against their own pregnancies throughout the U.S.. and most of these are happening in the absence of any law or court finding that explicitly says a pregnant person can be held criminally responsible for what they do and how it concerns their pregnancy.  Howard said. There s a great deal of maneuvering and gray area. but because they tend to be targeting the most marginalized people. they tend to get away with that legal gray area.  she continued.Even when the police aren t directly involved. punitive family court systems and child protective services have subjected pregnant and postpartum people to invasive regulation and surveillance. forced to spend months in a drug treatment facilitydid not offer the prenatal care she neededAdvocates believe cases like Beltran s serve as an ominous warning of what s to come without Roe on the books.  Substance use in pregnancy is already so stigmatized. so in some ways. the general public can get on board with criminalizing that.  Malik said.  But what people don t realize is that if Roe is overturned. this is gives state actors the power to criminalize anything they think is harmful to the fetus. More minute behaviors that are common everyday things ― like drinking coffee ― can be used to funnel people into this system. Having a glass of wine. eating deli meats and soft cheeses. exercising too hard. getting up to take care of your other children during your doctor-ordered bedrest. taking your prescribed antidepressants ― these are all actions that can have a negative impact on pregnancy and thus could serve as grounds for arrest in the future. It s a slippery slope. especially as pregnancy criminalization happens at the whims of state actors and prosecutors.  Malik said. Howard noted that arresting someone like Brittney Poolaw for the loss of her pregnancy ― while she legally could have had an abortion ― presents an inconsistency for many judges and prosecutors. which leads to the dismissal of many of these cases. But if this has already been happening with the protections of Roe in place. imagine what will happen if that contradiction isn t there.  she said. Subjecting more expectant parents to criminal charges related to their pregnancies could also have another dangerous consequence: discouraging people from seeking prenatal care.  There s a big threat to healthcare if patients see that the medical history they share with doctors can be passed along to law enforcement and used to put them in jail.  Malik said.  In states like Alabama. Oklahoma and Wisconsin. we re seeing eroded trust between patients and providers. medical and public health groups like ACOG25 states and the District of Columbiacan differ from their doctor s advice Doctors and nurses are becoming this new arm of the state. often out of fear that if they don t share a positive toxicology report or other information. they may themselves be criminally charged or lose their medical license.  Malik said.  In some states. they have to report any positive drug result. even if there are no signs of withdrawal or other causes for concern. You can t conclude that a child is is abused or neglected solely based on the presence of a chemical compound. increases in births occurring outside hospital settings In one case. a woman went into labor and tried to flee across state lines because she knew she d test positive for drug use but didn t want her baby taken away.  Howard said.  She ended up giving birth on the side of the highway. In another. there was a pregnant teenage girl who had smoked pot. She gave birth completely unassisted in a motel room because she was afraid of what would happen. To make matters worse. there s also fear that pregnant people s feelings about their pregnancies could be used as evidence against them ― which discourages talking about difficult emotions or concerns.falling down the stairsPurvi Patel s text messagesHoward expressed concerns that Patel s case opened the door for expectant parents to be charged for their miscarriages or stillbirths if they d previously expressed any doubts about their pregnancies. Even with Roe in place. it s alarming.  Howard said.  We already have a system that has essentially decided pregnant people don t have as many rights. The door has been cracked for awhile. but it s about to swing wide open. ,Health News
MIAMI (AP) — Florida is the only the state that hasn t preordered COVID-19 vaccines for toddlers in anticipation of their final approval by the federal government. and Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday that he won t facilitate their distribution. though he said they ll be available to those who want them.White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre. who confirmed Florida s outlier status on Thursday. said not preordering the vaccines could mean delaying their availability in children s hospitals and other facilities that have relied on state distribution of the shots.Florida officials said the jabs would be available at pharmacies and community health centers. which can preorder them directly from the federal government. and that children s hospitals and other clinics would be able to order them from the federal government via a state portal and receive them quickly. Doctors can get it. Hospitals can get it. But there s not going to be any state programs that are going to be trying to get COVID jabs to infants and toddlers and newborns.  DeSantis said at a news conference.  That s not where we re gonna be utilizing our resources. Final federal approval of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for ages 6 months through 5 years could come as early as next week. The Food and Drug Administration s vaccine advisers gave a thumbs-up Wednesday to vaccines from both pharmaceutical companies for children under 5. or roughly 18 million youngsters. arguing the benefits of the shots outweigh any risks.Florida s Health Department does not recommend COVID vaccines for healthy children under 17. but says children with underlying health conditions should be considered candidates for them. That advice contradicts the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. which so far has recommended the vaccines for everyone 5 years and older. saying the shots provide strong protection against hospitalization and death.In Florida. pharmacies and several supermarket chains. plus some community health centers. can preorder vaccines directly from the federal government. Other venues such as hospitals have previously benefited from the state s preordering of shots. However. they also can order them directly from the federal government via a Florida government web portal and receive the doses within days or a week. said health department spokesman Jeremy Redfern.Preordering the shots would mean the Florida health department would stockpile them. ship them to county-level health departments and then out to the hospitals. Redfern said. Hospitals that use the portal will be receiving the shots directly from the federal government. he said. The timing doesn t necessarily change  in a significant way. Redfern said.  This just cuts out the middle man. Jean-Pierre. at a news conference in Washington. said parents would be able to access children s vaccines through federal distribution channels at pharmacies and community health centers.  but those are limited options.  We encouraged Florida on several occasions to order vaccines.  Jean-Pierre said. By not doing so. the state  will not have immediate. ready access to some.  she said. ,Health News

She s anticipating anywhere from 20.000 to 30.000 additional out-of-state abortion patients a year if the court strikes down Roe ― a massive leap from the roughly 60.000 people the provider has seen annually for all reproductive health care needs in recent years.There s a similar feeling at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. or PPRM. which operates in several mountain west states. including two that are poised to become abortion safe havens: Colorado and New Mexico.Dr. Kristina Tocce. PPRM s medical director. spoke frankly when asked if she s confident they ll be able to meet the demand.  Not at all.  she said.  I feel confident that we are going to deliver excellent. safe. compassionate abortion care to as many patients as we can. which will be more patients than we have served in the past. but if you just look at the numbers ... it s just such an exponential increase. more than 30 million six-week abortion baneven more restrictive lawExpanding telemedicine services is essential to keep up with demand. Tocce said. noting that PPRM had already begun broadening those systems in recent years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For much of the first trimester. pregnancy may be terminated with a series of prescribed pills that don t necessarily require a clinic visit.  If we can take care of as many patients as we can outside of the brick-and-mortar facilities. that s going to be so instrumental in getting more patients who need in-person visits into those centers.  she said. In Illinois. Welch said. they ve been preparing for the fall of Roe since the day former President Donald Trump was elected in 2016.  Every time that president got another nominee on the Supreme Court. we knew that it was over.  she said of abortion protections. Since then. the Illinois branch has embarked on a big fundraising campaign. doubling the size of some existing clinics and building new ones along the borders of states that are hostile to abortion. including one near Indiana in 2018 and one near Wisconsin in 2020. They re welcoming any out-of-state clinic staff who want to start assisting with the surge in Illinois. approachingnational health care worker shortageIf the court strikes down Roe as expected.

It s never going to be illegal in Illinois. not if we have anything to say about it. ,Health News
This article is part of a larger series titled  The End Of Roe.  Head here to read more.The politicians and activists who decry abortion often brush past the cost of pregnancy. Someone with an unwanted pregnancy can just put the child up for adoption. they suggest. or perhaps a family member can care for it. As Republicans seek to end abortion rights and the Supreme Court prepares to potentially overturn Roe v. Wade. the suggestion seems to be to just have the baby and figure it out. But a pregnancy isn t that simple. There s the physical toll: the fatigue. sickness. possibility of long-term health issues and even. rarely. death. The emotional difficulty. The stress of needing to leave work for appointments (I had  only  13. but those with added complications can have appointments multiple times per week) and taking sick days (I took at least four. and would have needed more if I had a job that required me to be on my feet). The struggle of finding a way to afford time off for the birth and postpartum recovery in a country with no national paid maternity leave (this one was not. luckily. an issue for me personally. my husband had to take unpaid leave). Some of these things are hard to quantify. One thing isn t: the hospital bill. The cost of childbirth can vary a huge amount depending on type of birth. insurance. region and hospital. For patients on Medicaid. nearly all pregnancy and birth costs are covered. These patients make up a large share of births: Medicaid paid for 42% in the U.S. in 2019. But that leaves many births covered by private insurance. for which patients usually foot more of the bill. How much? On average. about $2.000. And that s just for the birth itself.The Health Care Cost Institute. an independent nonprofit. analyzed data from more than a third of the population with employer-sponsored insurance to dig into the out-of-pocket costs of childbirth. It found that those costs ranged from an average of $974 in Michigan to $2.685 in Nebraska. with a national average of $1.905 out of pocket. Costs can go much higher: The 90th percentile cost to patients for delivery was $4.327. according to HCCI s analysis.C-section births were typically more expensive. with an out-of-pocket cost of $1.962 on average nationally. whereas vaginal births cost patients an average of $1.875. Within those payments. HCCI found that the average cost of anesthesia services. such as an epidural. for vaginal births was about $200 to patients. according to analysis provided to HuffPost. My childbirth experience provides a more specific example. In many ways. it was a best-case scenario. with no major health concerns and employer-based insurance. It wound up on the low end of out-of-pocket costs. setting me back $1.527.93 — an amount that was still significant. especially combined with other pregnancy- and baby-related costs. I showed up at the hospital in the evening and within a few agonizing hours. received an epidural (for which I paid $109.38). The birth itself was uncomplicated. from a medical sense: My obstetrical care cost $292.40 out of pocket. The biggest out-of-pocket cost was the hospital stay. at $1.126.15. Without insurance. of course. this total would have been far higher: The hospital charged $25.887.42 for my total time in the hospital and $6.479.63 for the baby s. but insurance picked up her tab.It s tough to come up with average figures for prenatal care. but the doctor visits and tests add up. HCCI told HuffPost that. on average. patients whose costs it analyzed paid more than $1.300 out of pocket on medical costs in the nine months leading up to birth — costs that aren t necessarily related to pregnancy. but serve as a potential proxy.We can break that down a bit more.Most patients. even relatively low-risk ones. go to many appointments. Most of my 13 prenatal appointments had low co-pays of $7.26. some. for reasons I can t decipher. were more or less than that. bringing my all-in doctor visit cost to $162.24. I also paid $25 for the OB-GYN office to create a form for the birth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends having only one ultrasound in many cases. but it s common to have more than that — often at least two. and I had four. On average. ultrasounds cost the patient between $60 to $70 out of pocket. HCCI found. My ultrasounds were cheaper out of pocket: Some were covered entirely. and the two that came with a bill were $23.06 and $17.91 each. Pregnant people also undergo a huge number of tests and vaccinations. They re not very expensive — on average. routine tests cost patients less than $10. HCCI told HuffPost — but they can add up. Early in pregnancy. patients are typically tested for whether they are in fact pregnant. and then a series of other factors. including their blood type and whether they have various diseases and infections. Throughout the pregnancy. there are many more blood tests. along with a glucose screening. My tests only cost me $27.46 total. plus $8.77 for vaccinations. But that s not counting genetic testing or other services. which can cost a patient hundreds of dollars. Those cost me $309.85. These costs all assume a low-risk. uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth. which many are not. Severe morning sickness can lead to hospitalization. Six to nine percent of women develop gestational diabetes. which means more frequent testing and appointments. Restricting activity and bedrest. which is controversial but still recommended to about 20% of patients. often means time off work. At the hospital. some people are surprised with an out-of-network provider like an anesthesiologist. potentially increasing costs. Even variations on insurance and time of year can have a major effect on the out-of-pocket cost based on whether someone has already used up some of their deductible. After childbirth. the health care costs continue. Postpartum care in the U.S. is fairly lacking — many people get only one appointment at around six weeks. But postpartum issues also have a price tag. although out-of-pocket estimates are difficult given the number of variables. Some people need treatment for postpartum anxiety or depression — one in eight women suffer symptoms of postpartum depression — including appointment copays and sometimes medication. Some need postpartum physical therapy. which isn t always covered by insurance (I had a $20 copay per appointment). To go beyond health. there are other costly factors for a pregnant or postpartum person. Most need maternity clothes. Some will need new post-baby clothes. too. given many people don t go back to their pre-pregnancy size. There are lotions and salves for the discomfort. sitz baths for the postpartum pain. special underwear and. well. diapers for when the post-birth bleeding hasn t stopped. Whether someone has a wanted pregnancy or one they wished to end. most of these costs are unavoidable. And then there s the baby. Disposable diapers may run more than $900 in the first year. Child care costs have climbed to an average of over $14.000 per year during the pandemic. Breastfeeding isn t free. as it requires various supplies and a huge amount of time. formula isn t. either. typically running from $1.200 to $1.500 in the first year and taking up a new parent s time and energy. Babies need clothes. a place to sleep. a stroller. a car seat and more. Let s again set the baby aside. pretend costs related to them don t matter. Let s set aside the less tangible difficulties of pregnancy. Let s set aside that a pregnancy may be unwanted. Let s set aside the potential of major medical issues. Let s pretend that all a pregnant person needs to worry about is finances. I m one of the lucky ones — with employer-based insurance. relatively good health. a complication-free pregnancy and birth and a dual-income household with no other kids. And my all-in cost for medical bills alone was $2.202.22.That s two-thirds of many Americans  take-home pay each month. It s more than the median listed monthly rent in the U.S. It s equal to about four months of car payments. It s roughly five months of groceries for the average American family. Pregnancy isn t a health-neutral event. We shouldn t pretend it s a cost-neutral one. either. ,Health News
If you feelcascading collective traumaan articletraumas Individuals must grapple with intense direct exposure to cascading events (for example. personal illness or loss. social isolation. economic loss. violent policing). with varying and sometimes conflicting policies dictating public response.  they added. pandemicregular mass shootingsanti-Asian hateanti-Black police violencewarsrecord-high inflation causing economic distresshigh-profile sexual assault and harassment casesa fresh rise of openly white supremacist politicsabortion rights in perilEach one comes with a toll on your psyche and effects how well you can do your job.  The impact feels greater each time. because we have lower and lower capacity to deal. because we haven t had enough time to recover from the last thing.  said psychotherapist Esther Boykin. who likens it to catching a cold and then getting an allergic reaction. plus an infection on top of that. Trauma shows up in our bodies. and it can affect us in unseen ways. Silver. along with other researchers. has studied how residents in the Northeast responded to successive traumatic events like 9/11. Superstorm Sandy. the Sandy Hook shooting and the Boston Marathon bombing. She found that increased exposure to a trauma could increase emotional distress responses like hyper-vigilance. feeling  on edge.  trouble sleeping and emotional numbness in subsequent tragedies. But now with traumas happening on an almost-daily basis. Silver is not sure how we are processing it.  We are really being rapidly bombarded with these kinds of challenges. We may see something different now. I don t know.  she said.  I do know that emotional exhaustion is a response that we are seeing in our data. that I m hearing anecdotally that many people are reporting that they have just reached their limit. They can t listen to the news anymore. That s why Silver advises employers to be flexible in these times. and be understanding that people cannot always be bringing their  A-game  right now. Often traumas unfold as we are at work. making colleagues our most immediate possible support systems. And on the flip side. people may not share the more personal traumas they experience outside the office but are effected nonetheless.   There may be a number of challenges in the background that we may not see. because people may not share their individual challenges with their co-workers. but the emotional consequences of the individual challenges may still be there.  she said.  One of the best ways we can intervene with the effects of cascading trauma is creating space for more rest.  Boykin said. noting that rest is not just about more naps or a vacation. but also could mean detoxing from news for a while. or volunteering and reconnecting with people.Flexibility could also mean managers creating space for people to gather and support each other when something traumatic goes down during office hours ― and also giving them the clear option to opt out. Boykin said. Ideally. managers should be thinking about this before the next crisis hits. It means not just creating a plan.  but to be collaborative in creating that plan.  she said.  To genuinely ask the people who work for you to create ways for them to even anonymously share when things happen that are traumatic. what kind of resources do you need available to you at work? For Nancy Hanks. an Atlanta-based partner at a management consultant organization. cascading collective trauma included the death of her mother a year into the pandemic.  I was already dealing with my own personal grief. but then when you have police-involved shootings. and mass shootings. it can feel like a compounding of grief.  she said. As a Black woman. Hanks said the white supremacist attack on a grocery store in Buffalo. New York. deeply affected her. and as a former educator. the Uvalde. Texas school shooting  kind of broke  her. Her grief manifested as more fatigue. trouble sleeping and feeling more irritable and cynical during the work day. she said. What stands out in Hanks  memory in terms of meaningful support is when her colleagues and supervisor not only offered the option to cancel an engagement. but they were also proactive about offering their help. They sent texts like  Hey. just double-checking. you know I can take this... It s your call. but I m happy to do it.  It s one thing to cancel. but it s another thing for someone to pick up weight when we all feel pinched for time and capacity. It feels really gracious to me.  Hanks said. Part of being more flexible with each other means not assuming how colleagues are handling these collective traumas. Hanks. who is single and was quarantined alone during the pandemic. said one co-worker told her that people without child-rearing responsibilities should have to work more.  It feels like you know nothing about what is happening in my life or what this experience is like [when you are] assuming ‘Oh. you must have capacity.  Hanks said.  When my mother died. no one questioned that… But in that [pandemic] situation. it was more like ‘Hmm. must be pretty sweet for her.  To explain the nuances of how trauma impacts everyone. Hanks tells her team at work that they are in the  same storm. different boats.   We are all experiencing these storms.  she said.  We re in it together. but depending on how you are situated. whether that s your identity. your background. your socioeconomic status. your mental health. physical health. caretaker responsibilities. it can feel vastly different. Hanks said the collective traumas have made her a more somber. quieter and more empathetic manager.  There s a different lens that I bring to the work...I m one of thousands of people that are trying to individually grieve and collectively grieve.  I m not out of it.  she said.  I m leading with a bit of a broken heart. It s challenging some archetypes we have of leadership always having to be strong. courageous. or all-knowing. Especially in a world where charisma can be everything. I can t fake that. I don t have it. I haven t had it for a whole year. Glimmers of it come out — I m still me — but it would be a lot to get in front of people every day and act like I ve got the stamina to laugh. I miss my mom terribly every day. ,Health News
North Koreaongoing COVID-19 outbreakIt s unclear how serious the new epidemic is. but some outside observers say North Korea likely aims to burnish Kim s image as a leader caring about public livelihoods as he needs greater public support to overcome pandemic-related hardships.Kim on Wednesday offered his family s reserve medicines for those diagnosed with  an acute enteric epidemic  in the southwestern Haeju city. the official Korean Central News Agency reported. The North s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper separately carried a front-page photo showing Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju reviewing saline solutions and other medicines that they were donating.KCNA didn t elaborate on exactly what the epidemic is and how many people have been infected.Some observers say the  an enteric epidemic  in North Korea refers to an infectious disease like typhoid. dysentery or cholera. which are intestinal illnesses caused by germs via contaminated food and water or contact with feces of infected people.Such diseases routinely occur in North Korea. which lacks good water treatment facilities and whose public healthcare infrastructure largely remains broken since the mid-1990s.After North Korea last month reported a rising number of patients with feverish symptoms following its admission of the coronavirus outbreak.

A major trend in abortion care across the U.S. has begun to reverse. with the number of abortions performed in recent years ticking up after decades of decline. according to the Guttmacher Institute.reported to GuttmacherThe rise was greatest in the West and Midwest. Guttmacher suggested several factors that may have contributed to the change. such as increased support for local abortion funds and expanded Medicaid coverage in some states. An increase in abortion numbers is a positive development if it means people are getting the health care they want and need.  Guttmacher said in a statement.  Rather than focusing on reducing abortion. policies should instead center the needs of people and protect their right to bodily autonomy. But the findings come at a perilous moment in the history of American reproductive health care.Based on a leaked draft of a Supreme Court majority opinion. the court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The opinion concerns a case questioning the legality of a 15-week abortion ban enacted by the state of Mississippi. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the leaked draft and said the court would find out who was responsible.The court s final decision on the case. Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization. is expected to be handed down by July 1.With a supermajority of conservative justices now on the Supreme Court. conservative states have been working to pass more and more stringent abortion laws. Texas blazed a new trail with a law banning abortion at around the six-week mark that deputizes ordinary citizens to enforce it. and other states are following suit.,Health News

A lot of work goes into ensuring drugs are safe and effective for children because children are considered a vulnerable population.  Children are not little adults. and researchers know vaccine doses cannot just be cut in half for children.  Kanthula continued.  Children of different ages have different physiology and physiological responses.

COVID-19 shots for U.S. infants. toddlers and preschoolers moved a step closer Wednesday.The Food and Drug Administration s outside vaccine advisers gave a thumbs-up to Moderna s two shots for the littlest kids. The panel is set to vote later Wednesday on whether to also recommend Pfizer s three-shot series for those youngsters.The outside experts voted unanimously that the benefits of Moderna s shots outweigh any risks for children under 5 — that s roughly 18 million youngsters.shots should be available next week.  This is a long-awaited vaccine.  said one panel member. Dr. Jay Portnoy of Children s Hospital in Kansas City. Missouri.  There are so many parents who are absolutely desperate to get this vaccine and I think we owe it to them to give them a choice to have the vaccine if they want to. Dr. Peter Marks. FDA s vaccine chief. opened the meeting with data showing a  quite troubling surge   in young children s hospitalizations during the omicron wave. and noted 442 children under 4 have died during the pandemic. That s far fewer than adult deaths. but should not be dismissed in considering the need for vaccinating the youngest kids. he said. Each child that s lost essentially fractures a family.   Marks said.analyses postedThe two vaccines use the same technology but there are differences. In a call with reporters earlier this week. vaccine experts noted that the shots haven t been tested against each other. so there s no way to tell parents if one is superior. That is a really important point. ′ said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University. a former FDA vaccine chief.  You can t compare the vaccines directly.  If the FDA agrees with its advisers and authorizes the shots. there s one more step. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide on a formal recommendation after its own advisers meet Saturday. If the CDC signs off. shots could be available as soon as Monday or Tuesday at doctor s offices. hospitals and pharmacies..Pfizer s vaccine is for children 6 months through 4 years. Moderna s vaccine is for 6 months through 5 years.Moderna s shots are one-quarter the dose of the company s adult shots. Two doses appeared strong enough to prevent severe illness but only about 40% to 50% effective at preventing milder infections. Moderna has added a booster to its study and expects to eventually offer one.Pfizer s shots are just one-tenth its adult dose. Pfizer and partner BioNTech found that two shots didn t provide enough protection in testing. so a third was added during the omicron wave.Pfizer s submitted data found no safety concerns and suggested that three shots were 80% effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus infections. But that was based on just 10 COVID-19 cases. the calculation could change as more cases occur in the company s ongoing studies.FDA panel on Tuesday backed Moderna s half-sized shots for ages 6 to 11 and full-sized doses for teens.The nation s vaccination campaign started in December 2020 with the rollout of adult vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. with health care workers and nursing home residents first in line. Teens and school-age children were added last year.Moderna said in April that it is also seeking regulatory approval outside the U.S. for its little kid shots. According to the World Health Organization. 12 other countries already vaccinate kids under 5. with other brands.In the U.S.. it remains uncertain how many parents want their youngest vaccinated. While COVID-19 is generally less dangerous for young children than older kids and adults. there have been serious cases and some deaths. Many parents trying to keep unvaccinated tots safe have put off family trips or enrolling children in daycare or preschool.three-quarters of all children have already been infectedDr. Nimmi Rajagopal. a family medicine physician at Cook County Health in Chicago. said she s been preparing parents for months.

My decision to lose weight was sparked when I got COVID in December 2020. I was lucky — the illness wasn t bad. But it came at a time when my professional life was nearing. for me. unbearable. I had switched jobs to be with my family. I was being hazed in my new gig. my kids were at home with me every waking moment. My postpartum depression and anxiety. which had rolled five years later into just regular old depression and anxiety. were at an all-time high.And then: COVID. And I wanted something else for myself. I wanted not to eat my feelings. as I had been doing for years and which. after my second pregnancy. had resulted in 50 instead of 15 more pounds on my 5-foot frame. I wanted to feel like myself again. not a receptacle for everyone else s needs and desires and protocols. I wanted my body to stop following everything and everyone and every feeling around me and figure out what I actually wanted to eat. to feel. to do. My body takes up so much real estate in my day-to-day brain-time. the push and pull of trite self-hating ruminations and my shame about them as a person who teaches feminism for a living. I was sick. I was making myself sick at this nexus of growing up as a white woman in a culture that values thinness as a sign of self-regulation. a medical culture that associates obesity with every single health issue. and a feminist culture that told me to get over myself and love my body beyond measure. or else to not think of my body at all. I was exhausted by my body. I was not eating or moving or living with pleasure or a sense of my own desires. I felt too tired to have a body. to think about my body. Except that. of course. I always did.So when I felt my anxiety rise. I walked while I listened to mystery novels on audiobooks from the library (that Rita Mae Brown cats and murders series is hilarious). I walked while I played Pokémon Go with my kids. I ate a big bowl of oatmeal and raspberries. I did 10 minutes of yoga. I felt calmer. less anxious. less self-obsessed. I felt better. And since that December of 2020. I ve lost 50 pounds.As my kids started back at school. the parents I saw every day started in with.  Did you lose weight? You look amazing.  It was awkward. but also so human. While they were being honest with their curiosity. their words implied I did not  look great  before. I ve also watched as others clock my difference and discipline themselves into not saying anything. I appreciate the ideal that no one should ever mention your body. I also appreciate an embrace of the value of various aesthetic performances and acknowledging the labor. thought and creativity that go into them. It took me a long time to embrace that kind of feminine performance in myself. precisely because it didn t ― no matter how much I wanted it to ― come from a place of resistance or radicality. though I admire those who feel that it does for them.And now here I am. 50 pounds lighter and still thinking about my body. I feel more like  me.  but I also know that s a fiction of the fatphobia I ve internalized as much as it s a sign of my improving mental health. I still don t feel happy or comfortable in my body all or even most of the time. just like when I was 50 pounds heavier. I still feel great about my body in moments — the right lipstick. a new set of earrings I love. when I get up in forearm stand on my first try on my yoga mat — just like I did before. I desperately want to not care. to not feel attached to any of the weight loss. That s hard to do when you ve experienced life in a body that has fundamentally shifted — as well as opinions about my body from those around me.Because of the long pauses in in-person interaction during the ongoing pandemic. I often have to face my  new  body in conversation with colleagues. friends and my wider world of acquaintances. I try out different responses. noting that for me. my eating was correlated with my depression and anxiety. and this loss is a mark of how I am coping better with those conditions. Other times. I highlight my terrible relationship with my job. And sometimes. I just say that we got COVID in December 2020 and after that. I felt lucky and wanted to focus on moving more and feeling better long term. and that this loss was the incidental result. if not the goal. These things are all true.They are also all sometimes not true. Sometimes I marvel at what I have done at 43 and after two kids and with a tremendous amount of professional and personal responsibility. Sometimes I remember my 6-year-old telling me. pre-pandemic. that I was the fattest mommy he knew. and me choking out with a smile the mantra that  All bodies are good bodies  — which I believe and feel deeply — and then crying in the tiny closet pantry because I did not feel that for myself.My body and my feminism feel haunted by discipline. I resent the discipline that both require. And yet I am committed to them both as I move in the world. What if that were part of how we talked about feminism and our bodies — about what we honestly lose and gain in our quotidian. ethical. emotional and political lives as we live in our bodies. as they change and the world changes with them and against them? Caring for my body and caring for my feminist life is hard work. Being fat was as much work as being 50 pounds lighter. It s difficult to be in a body. it s all self-maintenance.My weight loss is a part of the story of my body and the story of my feminism― but this is not a screed about balance. choice or even compassion. It s about a desire to be honest about our feelings about our own bodies as feminists. Feminism can give us more than prescriptions about how to feel about our bodies. something between self-love/acceptance and total detachment. We can ask for a feminism that can grapple with our complicated feelings about our bodies. that doesn t ask us to constantly discipline ourselves into the right feelings. if we only work hard enough at our politics. To do this. we might have to lose the stories of what a feminist body should feel like. from the inside out.

monkeypoxThough the virus is now evident in other parts of the world. monkeypox has become synonymous with African countries. which is why a new name is being considered for the condition.The World Health Organization has said it is looking to rename the virus due to the connotations and assumptions that it is an  African disease. group of scientists signed a paperThe team of 29 experts are now calling it hMPXV and advocate for a  speedy decision and adoption of a new name. The disease was first called monkeypox as it was detected in the lab monkeys in 1958. Though it has been identified in wild monkeys in Africa. rodents are thought to be the cause of infection in humans in endemic regions.Scientists now say that calling it monkeypox and referring to it as African is  not only inaccurate but also discriminatory and stigmatizing.  In the paper released last week. the experts wrote:  There is an increasing narrative in the media and among many scientists that the present global outbreak is linked to Africa or West Africa. or Nigeria. Further. the use of geographical labels for strains of MPXV. specifically. references to the 2022 outbreak as belonging to the ‘West African  or ‘Western African  clade. strain. or genotype. The WHO s director-general. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. said the organization is  working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of the monkeypox virus. its clades and the disease it causes.  We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.  he added.The Foreign Press Association. Africa.In a statement they wrote:  We register our displeasure against media outlets using images of Black people alongside stories of the monkeypox outbreak in North America and the United Kingdom. More than 1.000 cases of the monkeypox have been confirmed in countries where the condition is not endemic ― roughly double the number reported in the week prior.Monkeypox is believed to have been spreading undetected in non-endemic countries for some time. and the WHO has said that the actual number of cases is likely much higher than the confirmed figure.However. the risk of contracting the virus ― which most people recover from within a few weeks ― remains low. health officials have said.In the U.K. ― which has seen the highest number of confirmed cases outside of the nine African countries where monkeypox is endemic ― health officials have advised anyone infected with the virus to use condoms for eight weeks after infection. and to abstain from sex while symptomatic. These are precautionary measures. as it is not yet known if the condition can spread through semen or vaginal fluids.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — A government advisory panel Tuesday endorsed a second brand of COVID-19 vaccine for school-age children and teens.The Food and Drug Administration s outside experts voted unanimously that Moderna s vaccine is safe and effective enough to give kids ages 6 to 17. If the FDA agrees. it would become the second option for those children. joining Pfizer s vaccine.tot-sized shots from Moderna and Pfizer for the littlest kidsModerna s COVID-19 vaccine has long been available for adults in the U.S. and elsewhere and more than three dozen countries offer it to older children. too. If the FDA authorizes Moderna s vaccine for teens and younger children. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will next decide whether to formally recommend the shots.The Massachusetts company is seeking clearance for two doses. and plans to later offer a booster. Tuesday s vote was only for two doses — full-strength for 12-17 and half-sized doses for those 6-11. The data do support that the benefits outweigh the risks for both of these doses. in both of these age groups.  said the CDC s Dr. Melinda Wharton. a member of the panel. I believe that this will provide families an important option  and may be particularly important for families who live in areas where coronavirus spread is increasing. said another panel member. Dr. Ofer Levy of Boston Children s Hospital.The FDA held up Moderna s teen vaccine for months while it investigated a rare side effect. heart inflammation. That s mostly a risk for teen boys and young men. and also can occur with the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna got extra scrutiny because its shots are a far higher dose.In their review. FDA scientists said there were no confirmed cases of the heart inflammation in Moderna s kid studies. But experts say the studies may have had too few participants for a rare side effect like that to appear. That clearly needs to be watched closely going forward as we expand the use of the vaccine.  said Dr. Mark Sawyer. a panel member from the University of California. San Diego s medical school.As for other side effects. FDA officials said nothing worrisome was reported — mainly sore arms. headache and fatigue.The FDA analysis concluded that two doses of Moderna are effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness in teens and younger kids. with the levels of virus-fighting antibodies comparable to those developed in young adults.Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 93% for the teens. and 77% for the younger children. according to the FDA analysis. However. the research was done when earlier versions of the coronavirus were causing most U.S. infections. before more contagious versions emerged. It s also based on a limited number of COVID-19 cases. making the estimates a bit rough.now recommended for children vaccinated with Pfizer s shotsOne panel member. Dr. Paul Offit. noted that vaccine effectiveness has declined against newer variants of the coronavirus. Offit. of Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. said he supported Moderna s proposals only because he expects a third dose will be offered. which he says is needed before someone should be considered fully vaccinated.How much demand there will be for even two Moderna shots isn t clear. Teens became eligible a year ago for Pfizer s vaccine. which uses the same technology. and only 60% have gotten two doses. Shots for younger kids started in November. about 29% have been fully vaccinated. according to the CDC.If the FDA authorizes Moderna shots for teens and schoolchildren. a CDC spokesperson said the agency is not expected to review the vaccine until later this month.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Ingram said.U.S. Senate Law enforcement leaders across the commonwealth tell me that. to curb overdose deaths. our number one priority should be to stop fentanyl from illegally entering our country through Mexico.  McConnell said.State officials also pointed to the availability of potent. inexpensive methamphetamine as another factor in Kentucky s latest rise in drug overdose deaths.The highest number of drug overdose deaths in 2021 occurred among Kentuckians aged 35-44. the report said. There were 672 deaths in that age group last year. up 17.5% from the prior year.The overdose fatality report was released by the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and the Office of Drug Control Policy.Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers.In 2020. more than 1.960 Kentuckians died from drug overdoses. up nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic death count of 1.316 in 2019. Many people discontinued their drug treatment efforts out of fear of contracting COVID-19. That. along with the sense of isolation caused by the virus. contributed to the 2020 surge in overdose deaths. state officials said then.Now. treatment and recovery programs are again ramping up across Kentucky. Every day we must work together to fund recovery programs and treatment options so that we can continue to address this scourge and get our people the help they need.  Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday in a news release.The governor said the overdose death toll was  devastating and extremely heartbreaking. Ahead of Monday s report. Beshear announced another step toward achieving a statewide policy goal of offering no-cost services close to home to help Kentuckians overcome drug addiction.The state is working to establish cities and counties as  Recovery Ready Communities  — aimed at providing high-quality recovery programs across Kentucky. Beshear s administration said. This drug epidemic in this country is going to be solved one community at a time.  Ingram said later Monday in touting the program.Kentucky s Office of Drug Control Policy is partnering with Volunteers of America to launch the Recovery Ready Community Certification Program. Cities and counties can apply for certification upon offering transportation. support groups and employment services at no cost for people seeking treatment for drug or alcohol addiction. A measure enacted last year by Kentucky lawmakers created an advisory council assigned to create the recovery ready certification.Kentucky state Rep. Adam Bowling. the measure s lead sponsor. said Monday that the program will  empower cities and counties to provide a powerful lifeline to help Kentuckians build a life free from addiction.  Make no mistake. substance abuse is a crippling. dangerous disease that can be prevented and treated successfully.  Bowling said in a statement.  However. those who face it must have community support and access to treatment and resources. regardless of where they live or how much money is in their bank account. ___People can call the KY Help Call Center at 833-8KY-HELP (833-859-4357) to speak one-on-one with a specialist who can connect Kentuckians to treatment.,Health News

PORTLAND. Maine (AP) — A network of adult care facilities in Maine will adopt a nondiscrimination policy about the care of transgender people as part of a settlement with a woman who filed a human rights complaint against the company.complained she was denied a room by an assisted living facility because she is transgender.Adult Family Care Homes of Maine will adopt the nondiscrimination policy in addition to sending employees and administrators at its nine facilities to LGBT-competency training. said attorneys for GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. which represented King. The nondiscrimination policy states that Adult Family Care Homes will  provide a welcoming environment and the best possible services to all communities. including older adults who are lesbian. gay. bisexual and/or transgender. King was initially anonymous when she filed her complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission. but later chose to identify herself. She said the settlement was a  positive outcome  for herself and other transgender elders seeking care. I believe the new policies will keep others from experiencing mistreatment and will help people understand that transgender people are only seeking to be treated with dignity and respect like anyone else.  King said.The human rights commission approved the settlement during its meeting on Monday without discussion. The commission s executive director confirmed the agreement and did not comment further.Rhonda Chambers. the administrator for Adult Family Care Homes of Maine. did not respond to a call seeking comment. The company runs elder care facilities mostly in rural parts of the state.The human rights commission found that there were reasonable grounds that one such facility. Sunrise Assisted Living in Jonesport. violated the Maine Human Rights Act and discriminated against King on the basis of sex and sexual orientation or gender identity. Attorneys for King have said she filed a complaint with the commission that Sunrise would not admit her because the facility was concerned she wanted to reside with a female roommate.The settlement that grew from King s complaint  sends an unmistakable message that transgender older adults should be treated with dignity and respect when seeking long-term care services.  said GLAD senior attorney Ben Klein.,Health News
Bulimia and I have been best friends since I was 13. At the time. my parents were fighting. and rage permeated our house. At school. I was the awkward immigrant kid. hoping someone would see me.But I had a few wonderful hours every day after school. when my parents weren t home and I had the house to myself. That s when my friend and I would sit together and watch our favorite shows — Three s Company. Love Boat. Fantasy Island — and eat anything we wanted without prying eyes. Piled-high ham and cheese sandwiches on soft white bread. handfuls of freshly-released-from-the-bag potato chips and soft. chewy Toll House chocolate chip cookies. The problem was. the high we got from food eventually vanished and we d be left with the hangover — the shame. guilt. disappointment. By age 15. the food highs weren t enough. I needed a way to deal with the repercussions — the bloating and self-hate. One day. I went to the bathroom and pushed two fingers down my throat. It was scary but also a thrill. I got relief. The consequences were flushed away. The desperate need and its violent extermination now just a memory. Bulimia comforted me. celebrated with me. entertained me. She was always there no matter how hard things got and she knew exactly how to make it better. This secret was part of my life for the next three decades. Thirty years of desperate highs and crippling lows. Thirty years of hiding behind locked bathroom doors and running showers to muffle the sound of vomiting. Thirty years of looking in a steamed-up bathroom mirror at a person I didn t want to be. Thirty years of being terrified of anyone finding out the grotesque ritual that was part of my life. Until one day. when I was 44. I told.I had been thinking of quitting for years because of the deep self-hate it produced. and had been slowly weaning myself off by stretching out the time between purges to months. Another reason I wanted to quit was my terrible acid reflux. I had started feeling burning in my throat and worried that maybe my years of bulimia had damaged the muscle designed to keep that bile from coming up.So when the doctor asked me at my annual checkup if I had any particular concerns. I told her about my throat pain and added that I was worried it was because of my years of bulimia. When were you bulimic?  she asked.  Oh. I —  I paused. took a breath. and said.  I still am. It s been — most of my life.  To my surprise. she didn t look at me with disgust or pity. or tell me all the ways I had damaged my body. She didn t lecture me at all. She told me that millions of people had acid reflux and that it may have nothing to do with my bulimia. She then asked straightforward questions about my plans. if any. to address it. I told her I d been working on it and that telling her was my first big step to quitting for good. She gave me resources that I could use and organizations that I could reach out to for help. She then went on to do my check-up. like she had done many times before.It was only a few minutes between us. but speaking the words out loud shook me. I almost felt dizzy with the confession and had to steady myself by holding the sides of the faux-leather bench. I had kept this secret for so many years that when it came out. I felt like a different person.That night. I kept telling. This time I told my husband. the quiet. mild-mannered man I slept next to and raised my children with. We were cuddled up on the couch watching  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  when he asked about my doctor s appointment. I stiffened. turned off the TV and turned to face him. Then I told him my story.I told him about the years of locking the bathroom door and turning on the shower so he couldn t hear the sounds of vomiting. I couldn t risk him asking me what was wrong. I told him I was scared that if he found out who I really was he wouldn t be able to look at me the same. Love me the same.He put his arms around me. Shocked and heartbroken that the woman he shared his life with had this secret. this pain. he held me for a long time as I cried into his shoulder.Telling him changed things. Without the secret. I was able to release the shame and stop one element of the disorder: the purging. I didn t reach out to any organization or read any books. The fear that my throat pain might be because of the binging. and releasing the truth to my husband were enough to push me to stop. I never did it again.  The binging ― the high – however. was still part of my life. albeit diminished. I found ways to avoid the yearnings by keeping busy. With the purging part gone. it released me from the  easy out  I had used every time the urge came up. I went back to work at a job I loved. went on long walks with friends and kept my life filled with the plethora of mom duties. I started living my life without bulimia s constant stranglehold.Then the pandemic hit. And like millions of people. it threw me into a dark and difficult place. My husband and I gave the kids their own rooms to do online school. The only other office-like area went to my husband. who needed space to Zoom with this work team. I was left with the kitchen table. I had lost the job I loved. regular daily activities of running errands and going to appointments. and friends I could spend time with who had helped me live a healthier life. I was left sitting in the kitchen with my laptop and countless idle hours of worry and anxiety. It was like being an alcoholic who lives in a bar. So I ate and ate. And I gained a lot of weight. But it wasn t the weight that crushed my self-esteem and mental health. It was the act of giving into this old friend — who I didn t trust anymore. who I understood didn t mean me well — day after day that wore away my confidence. After two years. as the pandemic eased. I emerged along with everyone else — but I was much heavier and scared about the steps forward. Eating disorders are unusually complex because we can t give up food completely like with other addictive substances. And there s such intense shame that comes with not being able to control your eating. So. we don t like to talk about it. we don t make big box-office movies about it and we certainly don t have the same sympathy for it. I ve found I can only move forward when I stop struggling in silence and let go of the shame. So as I did with the purging. I started being honest with myself and others close to me. One night. over dinner. I explained to my husband and teenage boys that the difficulties they d seen me have with losing weight was not about the food itself — that s why the dozens of weight loss programs I d tried had failed. Rather it was about my relationship with food. my addiction and my binge eating disorder. Once I verbalized this truth and accepted it. I was able to put down my guard and release the pain of it. A few days later. for the first time in my life I joined a binge eating disorder group and am now learning tools from counselors that specialize in this disorder. I don t know how long the journey forward will be. but I do know that in order to get better. I first need to forgive myself and be honest about the fact that I can t get better on my own. That s the only way forward. Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

warningsaccording to clinical trial results published Sunday led by scientists from Duke University and Vanderbilt UniversityThis clinical trial has not yet been peer-reviewed. The main measure of effectiveness of ivermectin used in the study was based on time to sustained recovery. which was defined as three consecutive days with no COVID symptoms. The key secondary outcome included a composite of hospitalization or death by day 28. wrote Duke Clinical Research Institute s Susanna Naggie. MD. MHS. one of the researchers involved in the study. in the document reviewing the study s results. Taking ivermectin for three days  resulted in less than one day of shortening of symptoms and did not lower incidence of hospitalization or death among outpatients with COVID-19 in the United States during the delta and omicron variant time periods.  the document stated.This clinical trial was part of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-6 study group. which investigates whether certain drugs approved by the FDA could be effective in treating patients at or over 30 years old with early mild-to-moderate COVID. ACTIV-6 adds to the growing evidence that there is not a clinically relevant treatment effect of ivermectin at this dose and duration.  Naggie wrote.  While those with severe symptoms at baseline appeared to have beneficial treatment effect with ivermectin as compared with placebo. this subgroup was small. thus these findings should be considered exploratory. consistent with findings of another large clinical trial in Brazilpublished by the New England Journal of Medicine in May Treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of COVID-19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of COVID-19.  those researchers concluded.Despite the lack of proof that the drug has a substantial effect against COVID. ivermectin has had prominent boosters. including podcaster Joe Rogan.Rogan deleted the tweet after this turned out to be incorrect said he took the drug A month earlier. the FDA had tweeted warning people against taking self-treating with ivermectin. which is commonly used on animals.the agency tweeted in August 2021published a detailed postissued a resolution praising the physician,Health News
youngest American childrenThe Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis of the Pfizer shot ahead of a Wednesday meeting where outside experts will vote on whether the shots are ready for the nation s 18 million babies. toddlers and preschoolers. Kids under 5 are the only group not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S.Late last week the FDA posted a similar analysis of Moderna s shots for children under 6.If regulators clear the shots by one or both companies. vaccinations could begin as soon as next week with the drugmakers ready to rapidly ship doses ordered by the government. Parents have been pressing federal officials for months for the opportunity to protect their smallest children as more adults shed masks and abandon other public health precautions.While only about 3% of U.S. COVID cases are in the age group 6 months to 4 years. hospitalization and death rates in that group are higher than those for older children. according to the FDA s analysis — one reason experts have said protecting this group is important.The FDA said children who received Pfizer s shots during testing developed high levels of virus-fighting antibodies expected to protect them against coronavirus. That s the basic threshold needed to win FDA authorization. But additional testing turned up key differences. with stronger results for Pfizer.Pfizer s vaccine. given as a three-shot series. appeared 80% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. although that calculation was based on just 10 cases diagnosed among study participants. The figure could change as Pfizer s study continues.Moderna s two-dose series was only about 40% to 50% effective at preventing milder infections. though the two companies  shots were tested at different times during the pandemic. when different variants were circulating. Moderna has begun testing a booster for tots.On Wednesday. the FDA will ask an independent panel of vaccine experts to debate both companies  data before voting. The FDA is not required to follow the group s recommendations. but the process is seen as a key step in publicly vetting the shots.The FDA is expected to make its official decision shortly after Wednesday s all-day meeting. The next step: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. which recommends how to use vaccines. will convene its own expert panel to debate which tots need vaccinations.It s not clear how much demand there will initially be for the shots. A recent survey suggests only 1 in 5 parents of young children would get their kids vaccinated right away. Vaccines have been available since November for older U.S. schoolchildren. yet less than a third of those ages 5 to 11 have gotten the two recommended doses. according to government figures.For the youngest children. each company is offering different dose sizes and number of shots. beginning at 6 months through 4 years for Pfizer and through 5 years for Moderna.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech plan to offer two shots three weeks apart followed by a third at least two months later — each one-tenth the dose given to adults. Pfizer is currently the only company with a COVID-19 vaccine for older U.S. children.Moderna is seeking FDA clearance for two shots. each a quarter of its adult dose. given about four weeks apart.The FDA currently allows Moderna s vaccine to be used only in adults. But some countries allow full-size doses for teens and half-size shots for kids ages 6 to 11 — a step the FDA also is considering.More than 30.000 U.S. children younger than 5 have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and nearly 500 coronavirus deaths have been reported in that age group. according to U.S. health officials.The government allowed pharmacies and states to start placing orders for tot-sized doses last week. with 5 million initially available — half made by Pfizer and half by Moderna.____The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

OK. so hot dogs aren t the world s healthiest food. but admit it: If they weren t on the menu at summer barbecues. it d feel like losing a friend.Fortunately. with a growing number of healthier hot dogs hitting supermarket shelves. it s become possible to indulge and still go easy on your body. You just need to know what to look out for.First things first:  Avoid traditional or ballpark-labeled hot dogs.  Nicole Avena. a New York-based nutrition consultant. told HuffPost.  These are usually the highest in sodium and contain the most additives and preservatives. All processed meats are a health risk ― they ve been linked to certain types of cancer. like colorectal cancer. because of the way they re preserved. But there are a few types of meat that offer less risk than the standard beef hot dog. Avena said. Look for a label that indicates whole beef. turkey or chicken. as opposed to mechanically processed and separated meats.Another important factor is sodium content.  Choose hot dogs that have less than 400 mg (or less than 20% of the daily value) of sodium per serving.  said Gretchen Zimmermann. senior director of cardiometabolic care for Vida Health. (The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults limit sodium intake to less than 2.300 mg per day.)Other indications of a higher-quality hot dog are if they re uncured and nitrate- and nitrite-free. and have minimal ingredients.  Overall. uncured chicken or turkey hot dogs would be a better option. because they re usually lower in saturated fat and less processed than beef.  Avena said.But even if the label says  uncured.   no nitrates added  or  all natural.  it doesn t mean these options are necessarily healthier. Natural preservatives. such as celery powder and celery salt. may sound better. but there s no evidence they re safer. so it s still best to minimize your intake.The same goes for veggie dogs: Choose dogs with minimally processed ingredients. such as tofu. instead of heavily processed soy protein concentrate or isolate. An occasional processed veggie dog isn t likely to be harmful. but these soy ingredients haven t been well-studied. so there are still some concerns about their safety.  said Samantha Cassetty. nutrition expert and co-author of  Sugar Shock. To save you time scanning nutrition labels. here are the healthiest and the least healthy store-bought hot dogs according to nutritionists.If any of your go-to dogs made the  steer clear  list. it doesn t mean you have to ghost them.  Going to barbecues and eating less healthy foods are part of living a joy-filled life.  Cassetty said.Her advice? If you feel that no family barbecue is complete without a Ball Park frank in your hand. then have one and enjoy. Just don t make hot dogs a way of life. The occasional hot dog at a barbecue when you re otherwise eating a mostly healthy diet isn t going to wreck your health.  Cassetty said.  So pick the one you ll enjoy and be mindful of your diet as a whole. ,Health News
For most of my adult life. National Tap Dance Day. which passed recently. would have garnered about as much attention from me as National Ballpoint Pen Day. This year. however. that has changed: I am part of the Mondays at 2 p.m. absolute beginner adult tap dancing crew at the Mid-Westchester Jewish Community Center. and I have never felt like more of a badass.But my drive to tap was born out of a dark place. Following the birth of my second baby in April 2021. I developed postpartum depression. PPD is a complex hormonal and environmental beast that s often misunderstood. For me. it was a combination of moving to the suburbs after spending my entire adult life living in cities. exacerbated by the stress and isolation of the pandemic. and work pressure that had me taking a call literally the same hour that my daughter entered the world.Add a dash of new parent sleep deprivation to fuel the hormonal fire ― I was completely unmoored.While I was able to get through these more severe feelings with a therapist. I still struggled on a daily ― OK. hourly ― basis to accept my postpartum body. (The constant barrage of Facebook ads selling me ways to  Eliminate that abdominal shelf!  didn t help.)My history as a ballet dancer also exacerbated the issue. I was on a pre-professional track in ballet from ages 5-18. which meant that at one point as a teenager in the late 90s/early 2000s. I attended up to six classes a week. foregoing many of the other pleasures of adolescence in pursuit of my dancing dreams. And while I didn t fully recognize it at the time. I was also spending six days a week learning to believe that my body was not good enough ― not strong enough. not graceful enough. not turned out enough. not focused enough and certainly not thin enough. The entire time I danced. I probably never broke 110 pounds at 5 feet 4 inches tall. and still. with my  curves  (i.e.. human woman hips and breasts that required more support than a training bra). there was no way my body would be acceptable to professional dance companies ― or so I was warned by well-meaning teachers.I decided to quit on the day a fellow dancer commented in the dressing room that I  looked surprisingly good in street clothes.  I couldfinally see after over a decade of dancing that my love for ballet was not enough to justify the daily blows to my self-worth. It may seem counterintuitive that to redefine your relationship with your body you would return to the activity that tainted that relationship in the first place. but it turns out dancing ― and specifically tap dancing ― is exactly what I needed to start and deepen that process of reconnection.Over the last five to 10 years. ballet dancers have become much more vocal about the need for body inclusivity in their artform. but I ve yet to see a major company like NYCB or ABT feature more than the occasional. token dancer who doesn t fit ballet s limited narrative of dancers as thin and white.Tap dancing. on the other hand. is one of the few western dance styles that doesn t have a culture of weight stigma or ageism ― some of the greatest professional tap dancers started as adults and were still in their prime of dancing well into their 80s.And so. when I saw that my local JCC was offering a class (in-person. not on friggin  Zoom!). and that it was a class for the most clueless of beginners. I jumped at the opportunity. At our first class. there was an instant sense of comradery. The dancers ranged in age from 30 to 70. but despite our varying life experiences and generational perspectives. we all knew jack-shit about tap dancing. As an absolute beginner. I felt a wonderful permission to fail that didn t exist in ballet or motherhood. Of course. in both ballet and motherhood you make mistakes constantly (my daughter is chewing on an iPhone charger as I write). but mistakes in those arenas are often accompanied by a deep sense of shame. or at least the expectation of self-beratement. But for at least one hour a week in tap class. I had permission to be terrible. And with that permission. I found that instead of obsessing over how I looked in the mirror. or whether I was meeting some unattainable standard. I was focusing on how it actually felt to dance. First. I felt grateful just to have gotten out of my house for an activity that didn t involve Peppa Pig. I made this class a non-negotiable part of my week. something we rarely do as mothers (putting ourselves first). or even generally as people (recognizing the importance of prioritizing joyful movement for our emotional and physical health).It felt especially healing to connect with the same group of women ― hereafter referred to as the  tap crew  ― on a weekly basis. I relished walking into a room of people who understood that I was in an exhausting stage of life with a toddler and a baby. and who made me feel like a badass for just showing up. Not only were we all hungry for this IRL connection after COVID. but with the busy. burnout lifestyles most of my millennial friends lead. this was also the only place I could come where no one would be distracted. (There s no time to check your phone when you re drilling the Maxi Ford to Bandstand Boogie.) Loneliness often sets in for new parents because the relationship is so one-sided when your kids are very young. but with the tap crew I could share something with a group that was meaningful to all of us. Moreover. these ladies were fearless. ready to look silly while trying something new and always happy to offer their fellow tappers unconditional support instead of seeing our dancing through the prism of competition. I also started to marvel at how my body ― in its current shape and size ― could move after two pregnancies and two years of staying confined. (My main source of physical activity during the pandemic was Cloroxing groceries and attempting to diaper children who had no interest in being diapered.) Since tap emphasizes expressing emotion and character through rhythmic sounds. I wasn t as fixated on the visual. so it allowed me to develop better interoceptive awareness. Instead of constantly worrying about how I looked to others. my internal monologue went something like  Am I breathing through this shuffle ball change? Ah. let me try to swing that rhythm a little bit more  and  Holy smokes. did all of our feet really just make collective music out of nothing?! In ballet. I was usually trying to blend in with the corps de ballet. and in a solo. take up space in a very cautious. deliberate. graceful way. In tap. there are times for precision. but you are often encouraged to just feel the music and relax into the steps (a move called  The Goofus  comes to mind). and you can generally be as loud as you like. Indeed. one of the most challenging and liberating aspects of tap for me was learning to take up more space and make more sound.In a couple of months. I d say I went from  absolute beginner  to  still pretty amateur.  but how I viewed my body began to change. I have an unfortunate wall-to-wall mirror in my bathroom. where I could ruminate over stretch marks or crane my neck to investigate back fat rolls. But now. whenever I noticed the negative self-talk surfacing. I literally announce to my reflection:  Hey lady. you birthed two 10-pound babies. and you still have the energy to do THIS.  followed by a series of kick-ass buffalo steps over to my morning shower. At the time. my infant daughter was obsessed with shoes ― throwing them. biting them. offering a pair of fragrant tennis sneakers to anyone passing by our hall closet ― and my tap shoes were no exception. As I watched this little Carrie Bradshaw/Shirley Temple slam my taps into the new hardwood floors with gleeful abandon. I became acutely aware that to her. the body was just an instrument to explore and control the world. and it brought her nothing but joy. I pledged that I would try to have the same attitude and continue to model that perspective for my daughter as she grew and became more self-aware. Of course. tap hasn t magically cured me of body shame. I recognize this is something I will be negotiating for a long time. because no matter what inner work I do. we live in a culture obsessed with dieting. promoting unnatural thinness and conflating body size with morality and health.But in returning to dance. I ve also figured out that my tap crew. my friends and my family ― especially my children ― don t give a flying fuck about what the scale says. And while I m inordinately proud of the fact that I can now Shim Sham on demand. the realization that I am more than a body. that what I think. what I have to say and the relationships I nurture are what define the core of who I am. has been the most badass part of it all.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

There s a riskmonkeypoxWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said most monkeypox cases are appearing among men who have had sexual relations with other men. Some countries are also starting to report possible community transmission of the virus. which is capable of going airborne and spreading through close contact.believed to have been spreadingHowever. the risk of contracting the virus ― which most people recover from within a few weeks ― remains low. health officials have said. The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic countries is real.  Tedros said.  There are effective ways for people to protect themselves and others. People with symptoms should isolate at home and consult a health worker. Those who share a household with an infected person should avoid close contact. nine African countriesadvised anyone infected40 cases have been reported18 cases it reportedraised its travel alertThe risk to the general public is low. the CDC noted. but anyone who experiences an  unexplained skin rash  should seek medical attention.The New York Times reportedTedros said there have been no deaths attributed to the monkeypox virus in non-endemic countries. In African countries where the virus is endemic. the situation is more serious: This year. there have been more than 1.400 suspected cases and 66 deaths. Tedros said. This virus has been circulating and killing in Africa for decades. It s an unfortunate reflection of the world we live in that the international community is only now paying attention to monkeypox because it has appeared in high-income countries.  he said.  The communities that live with the threat of this virus every day deserve the same concern. the same care. and the same access to tools to protect themselves. ,Health News
The Biden administration is preparing to shift COVID-19 money away from critical public health programs. including testing. to pay for new vaccines and therapeutics. as Congress stalls on approving additional pandemic funding and omicron subvariants spread across the country.told The Washington PostThis funding shift will undercut other initiatives. including plans to produce more COVID-19 tests in the U.S.. and a plan to stockpile ventilators and personal protective equipment. another aide told the Post.Dr. Ashish Jha. the White House COVID-19 response coordinator. has repeatedly issued warnings to Congress that the U.S. is in need of COVID-19 funding to be prepared for future waves. If you want to ask what keeps me awake at night. it is that we are going to run out of vaccines.  Jha told reporters in the White House briefing room Friday.  We re not going to be able to have enough of the next generation of vaccines. We re going to run out of treatments. And we re going to run out of diagnostic tests. probably in the late fall into winter. if we end up having a significant surge of infections. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionaccording to The New York TimesShaman expects to see cases rise due to BA.4 and BA.5. but without necessarily seeing a rise in hospitalizations and deaths. if the U.S. follows a similar trajectory to South Africa.For now. BA.2.12.1 still remains the dominant variant. making up over 62% of total cases in the U.S.. according to CDC data.Overall. the constant emergence of new subvariants that are able to evade immune responses has meant many Americans have been getting reinfected with COVID-19. told ABC News When he told me that I was positive for COVID-19 again. I thought. ‘You ve got to be kidding me.   McDonnell said.  I thought you know six months. I m good. I don t need to wear a mask. We were at like a whole bunch of sporting events … at parties without masks. no social distancing — nothing — we thought we had time. McDonnell is hardly alone in experiencing reinfection.

As parents across the country have long awaited a vaccine against the coronavirus for young children. doses for kids younger than 5 could be available as soon as June 21. according to the Biden administration. A year and a half after vaccines were made available to older U.S. adults in January 2021. senior administration officials laid out a plan to get vaccines to toddlers and babies on a press call Wednesday. By the middle of next week. the Food and Drug Administration s advisory committee is expected to meet to decide whether to authorize the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for children under 5. Then. later in the week. the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would decide whether to recommend the vaccines. Pending FDA and CDC authorization. the Biden administration would immediately begin shipping doses across the country. with 10 million vaccine doses available for states. community health centers and pharmacies to pre-order. and millions more available in the following weeks. Parents will be able to get their kids vaccinated at pediatricians  and other doctors  offices. community health centers. children s hospitals. local pharmacies and other community organizations. The administration also plans to work with libraries and children s museums. as well as Black. Latinx. Asian Pacific Islander and Native community groups to raise awareness and answer questions about the vaccine. They ll be reaching out to parents through federal programs including WIC. SNAP. Medicaid and Head Start. Currently. vaccines are available only for children 5 and older and for adults. About two-thirds of Americans have been fully vaccinated so far. If vaccines are authorized for children under 5. nearly everyone in the U.S. would be eligible for the protection against the virus. Pfizer said late last month that three doses of its vaccine offer strong protection for toddlers and babies ages 6 months to 4 years old. and the company was providing its data to U.S. regulators. Moderna was also hoping to get approval to provide two doses of its vaccine for little kids sometime this summer. While coronavirus cases are currently far lower than they were during the major winter spike. COVID-19 cases have still risen significantly in recent weeks. with cases more than tripling over the last two months across the country. More than 300 people on average are dying of COVID-19 complications each day. Last month. the U.S. surpassed a horrific milestone of 1 million people dead from COVID-19 since the pandemic began.,Health News

ModernaCOVID-19 COVID-19 vaccine makers are studying updated boosters that might be offered in the fall to better protect people against future coronavirus surges.Moderna s preliminary study results show people given the combination shot experienced an eight-fold increase in virus-fighting antibodies capable of targeting the omicron mutant. the company announced.Today s COVID-19 vaccines all are based on the original version of the coronavirus. They re still providing strong protection against severe disease. hospitalization and death even after the appearance of the super-contagious omicron variant ― especially if people have had a booster dose.But the virus continues to mutate rapidly in ways that let it evade some of the vaccines  protections and cause milder infections.So U.S. regulators. and the World Health Organization. are considering whether to order a change in the vaccine recipe for a new round of booster shots in the fall ― when cold weather and kids returning to school are expected to drive yet another surge.Key questions: How to make that change without losing the continued strong protection against COVID-19 s worst outcomes? And what s the right variant to target? After the huge winter omicron surge. that mutant s genetically distinct siblings now are the main threats. including one that s fueling the current U.S. wave of infections.The Food and Drug Administration has set a meeting in late June for its scientific advisers to debate those questions and evaluate data from vaccine makers  tests of potential new formulas. Pfizer also is studying a combination shot. what scientists call a bivalent vaccine.Moderna said its new study found that a month after the combo shot. recipients harbored higher omicron-fighting antibody levels ― and cross-protection against other prior variants — than the original vaccine triggers. However. antibodies naturally wane so it s not clear how long the protection against infection will last.The study was performed in 437 people. and safety was similar to today s boosters. Moderna said. The results were announced in a press release and haven t undergone scientific review.,Health News
Stress. Anxiety. Noisy neighbors. Blanket-hogging partners. With the list of things that can disturb a person s sleep being more of a scroll. it s no wonder an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans are affected by sleep-related problems. according to the American Sleep Apnea Association.Included on that list might be symptoms you don t even know you re experiencing as a result of an undiagnosed sleep disorder — or a health condition that s bringing on a sleep disorder. Most people will realize their sleep was disrupted when they feel excessive fatigue the next day. but it s often difficult to trace this excessive fatigue to symptoms such as congestion. digestive issues or pain.  said Dr. Janice Johnston. co-founder and chief medical officer of U.S. health care plan Redirect Health.  Instead. people may misattribute these feelings to a lack of caffeine. a late night or daytime stress. If you experience any — or more than one — of the following symptoms after hitting the sheets. it might be time to check in with your doctor for a consult.Gasping for air is most commonly a sign of sleep apnea. a sleep disorder where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts.  During sleep. the muscles relax and the throat narrows or closes off.  said Dr. Zeeshan Khan. director of the Institute of Sleep Medicine at Deborah Heart and Lung Center in Browns Mills. New Jersey. Sleep apnea is also associated with snoring. choking while you sleep and waking up with a dry mouth and headache.  A sleep specialist can order a sleep study to determine if you have sleep apnea. which is typically treated with a device called CPAP — continuous air at a set pressure that splints the airway open.  Khan said.Postnasal drip is another possible culprit.  When too much mucus makes its way to the back of the throat. it can block airways. causing people to temporarily stop breathing while sleeping.  Johnston said.  This leaves them gasping for air. It can be caused by allergies. changes in weather or the common cold. Staying hydrated can help thin out mucus and make it pass more easily. Ditto mucus-thinning agents. like Mucinex. and saline nasal irrigations. If OTC strategies don t cut it. a specialist can curb post-nasal drip by prescribing a decongestant to help clear mucus and prevent your throat from becoming blocked. while also checking for other possible causes. such as a sinus condition. like allergies or sinusitis.Acid reflux can also cause gasping. thanks to acidic secretions from the stomach refluxing up to the esophagus.  Often. patients will taste an acidic feeling in their mouth.  Johnston said. Sleeping on your left side. elevating the top half of your body with a wedge pillow or popping antacids may help get nighttime gasping under control.Snoring is another common symptom of sleep apnea.  When there s narrowing along the airway. either in the nose or throat. the tissue begins to vibrate and make a snoring sound.  Khan said.  This can be associated with gasping for air or snorting while sleeping. dry mouth in the morning and nasal congestion. It can also be caused by allergies or the common cold. as well as being overweight. Johnston said. Shortness of breath and increased sweating are additional symptoms that might disrupt your sleep.A sleep specialist can order a sleep study to determine if you have sleep apnea. If there s no evidence of sleep apnea. then different treatment options for snoring include sleeping on your side. raising the head of the bed. utilizing nasal strips. nasal sprays or an oral appliance.Sleepwalking is considered a parasomnia. or an undesirable behavior or experience during sleep.  It s a disorder during the deepest stage of non-REM sleep when the brain is interrupted and is in a state between sleep and wakefulness.  Khan said. It can be caused by sleep deprivation. stress. anxiety or fever. Taking certain medications. like hypnotics. sedatives or certain medications used for psychiatric disorders. can also be a contributing factor. Ditto alcohol use.A sleep specialist can diagnose this disorder by taking a thorough history and ordering a sleep study. Preventative measures are recommended (such as adjusting medications and being woken up around 15 minutes before you usually sleepwalk) and triggers like sleep deprivation. stress and alcohol are to be avoided.Sleep talking. or somniloquy. is one of the most common parasomnias with an unknown cause.  It s more frequent in people with mental illnesses and can be associated with sleepwalking and nightmares.  Khan said. Other causes may include emotional stress. fevers and substance misuse. These health conditions can lead to a reduced ability to concentrate. extreme mood swings or hallucinations.  Johnston said.  If sleep talking isn t a normal occurrence and causes alarm. it s important to see a specialist. They can diagnose this disorder by taking a thorough history and ordering a sleep study if needed.  Preventative measures are recommended. where triggers such as stress. sleep deprivation and alcohol are avoided.  Khan said. Certain medications. like antidepressants. can trigger sleep talking. so your specialist may make adjustments to what you re taking as well.Ongoing nightmaresTreatment for chronic nightmares might be necessary if your nightmares are causing distress. messing with your sleep and interfering with your daytime functioning. Chronic nightmares can cause extreme adverse health effects. such as an increased risk of suicide. heart disease and obesity.  Johnston said.  Those suffering from chronic nightmares should seek treatment and advice from a medical professional. Your nightmares might be a side effect of a medication you re on. in which case your doctor might change the dosage or prescription to alleviate your nightmares. Johnston said. They can also help you find time-management. prioritization and stress-reduction skills that suit your situation if your nightmares are being caused by anxiety and depression.Imagery rehearsal therapyNocturia. or waking up to pee in the middle of the night. becomes more common as you age. but can also be a sign of something else going on.  It can be caused by the natural aging process of the bladder or triggered by a medical issue.  Khan said. Nocturia can happen on its own or coincide with peeing frequently during the day.The most obvious cause is drinking too much fluid too close to bedtime. However. other health conditions causing frequent urination at night may be more severe. such as a bladder or urinary tract infection. diabetes. an enlarged prostate gland or chronic kidney failure. To monitor the issue. you can first start by limiting the amount of fluid you intake prior to bedtime.  Johnston said. Keep a bladder diary for a few days of how much you drink. how often you have to go the bathroom and roughly how much you peed. ( You should also record any medications you re taking. any UTIs and any related symptoms.  Johnston said.)Your doctor can then use this information to determine the possible causes of — and treatment for — your nocturia. Depending on the health condition. treatments can include anticholinergic drugs. which lessen the symptoms of an overactive bladder. or treating the condition or infection. such as diabetes or a UTI.The adverse effects of sleep bruxism. where you clench or grind your teeth while you sleep. can be noticed during the day by a dull headache or sore jaw. It s considered a sleep-related movement disorder. and according to the Mayo Clinic. people who grind their teeth during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders. like snoring and sleep apnea. Bruxism can be caused by stress and anxiety. but is more likely caused by an abnormal bite.  Johnston said.  Your dentist can examine the mouth and jaw for signs and symptoms. such as wear and tear on teeth or loose teeth. The dentist can then fit the individual with a mouth guard to protect their teeth at night. Being able to fall asleep quickly isn t necessarily a bad thing. so long as you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.  However. if you re getting less than the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night and you pass out the moment your head hits the pillow. it could be your body telling you it needs more rest.  Johnston said.Other signs of sleep deprivation include excessive daytime sleepiness and difficulty regulating emotions or focusing on simple tasks. Another sign is feeling drowsy or dozing off when doing mundane activities. such as watching TV or driving. If you suspect you may be experiencing sleep deprivation. you can utilize the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure the severity of your sleepiness. but it s also recommended you seek out a sleep specialist so they can run proper tests to help you get your sleep back on track.  Johnston said. especially if you already practice proper sleep hygiene and sleep deprivation is still a series regular.It could be a sign of a sleep disorder. such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy. a condition where sleepiness comes out of nowhere and can result in you falling asleep instantly (better known as sleep attacks). With narcolepsy. there s a loss of a neurotransmitter that regulates wakefulness.  Khan said.  In addition to excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks. you may also experience cataplexy (brief periods of muscle weakness) and disrupted nighttime sleep. A sleep specialist can diagnose the cause and order a sleep study if needed—and if it turns out you do have narcolepsy. medications can be prescribed to keep you awake.Sleep-related eating disorders (SRED) are when individuals consume food while fully asleep and are unaware of their actions. SRED can be drug-induced (using sleep aids. like Ambien or Lunesta. is a common culprit) or can occur in people who have other sleep disorders. like restless legs syndrome. People who experience SRED are at an increased risk of fatigue. depression and weight gain.  Johnston said. They re also at risk of burning or cutting themselves when they re preparing food in their sleep or poisoning themselves by eating non-food substances.If your SRED is drug-induced. a sleep specialist might recommend using alternate medications or halting the use of certain medications entirely. If not the result of medications.  a medical expert may recommend lifestyle changes to manage stress levels and remove potential hazards that could harm you during an SRED episode.  Johnston said. such as moving furniture so you don t fall on your way to the kitchen. placing locks on the fridge. cupboards and oven — even putting an alarm on your bedroom door.Your partner or roommates may point out any sleep disturbances you re experiencing so you can get them checked out. but that s not exactly an option when you live solo. For people who live by themselves. it s a challenge to monitor for a sleep disorder.  said Dr. Thomas Hammond. board-certified neurologist at the Marcus Neuroscience Institute in Boca Raton. Florida.  Sometimes the house is in disarray but wasn t that way before they went to bed. making it easier to notice something s going on. Most of the time. though. you might sense something s off with your sleep — say. feeling excessively tired or irritable during the day. despite getting the recommend hours of shuteye — but not wake up to concrete evidence the next day.Enter sleep trackers.  There are a number of ways to track sleep to understand the potential symptoms that are occurring.  Johnston said.  These might include wearable devices. bedside devices and bed sensors. Wearable devices can collect information regarding movement. heart rate and breathing patterns.  Since many of these devices are multipurpose. users can use them to track eating habits and breathing patterns during the day as well.  Johnston said. If your usual amount of sleep is decreasing significantly. for instance. you could speculate it s being caused by symptoms related to your health conditions. You can then compare and contrast this information with your sleep patterns to have a better understanding of what symptoms may be striking during sleep and why.Bedside devices are placed next to the bed and can collect data regarding breathing habits and body movement.  This information can help to determine if you re experiencing shortness of breath or excessive movement during sleep.  Johnston said. (The device may also store information about your bedroom environment. such as temperature. ambient noise and light.)Then there are bed sensors. which can be placed underneath the sheets or mattress.  These sensors collect information regarding movement and heart rate.  Johnston said.  Irregular heart rates can be tied to health conditions. such as hyperthyroidism or excessive stress.  (Some sensors may also track temperature and humidity.)Once you ve got two to three weeks worth of sleep data. you can bring it to your next doctor s appointment for a consult. Because consumer devices aren t tested or regulated for clinical diagnosis. they won t be able to use the data to officially diagnose you. but they can at least use the data to help determine whether clinical testing would be beneficial.,Health News

abortionIt became real to him in 2013. when his girlfriend. now his wife. became pregnant with their first child together. She d had a healthy pregnancy before. his stepdaughter. but this time genetic testing found a lethal chromosomal disorder in the developing fetus. one that would likely result in a stillbirth and also possibly put her life at risk during a delivery. As a man. I didn t know how to console her. how to advise her.  Atterberry. now 32. recalls.  I said. ‘If I had to choose. I would choose you.  ... It wasn t a matter of do I believe in abortion or I don t believe in abortion. At that point. I was thinking about her life.

Atterberry says.a high court ruling1973 Roe v. Wade decisionleaked to a news outletWomen have always taken the lead in the fight to preserve abortion rights. for obvious reasons: They are the ones who give birth and who. in so many instances. are tasked with caring for children once they are brought into the world.No one is calling for that leadership to change. said David Cohen. a law professor at Drexel University who specializes in law and gender. Men should not be out there trying to run the movement or take away leadership positions.  he said.  But being a part of it. supporting. listening and being active are all things that men can and should be doing. That s what Oren Jacobson is trying to do at Men4Choice. the organization he co-founded in 2015. where the goal is to get men who say they support abortion rights to speak out and do more. such as protesting. making it a voting priority. and especially talking to other men. Everything we re doing is focused on getting what are really millions of men — who in theory are pro-choice but are completely passive when it comes to their voice and their energy and their time in the fight for abortion rights and abortion access — to get off the sidelines and step in the fight as allies.  he said.It hasn t been the easiest of tasks.Abortion  is almost never a conversation inside of male circles unless it s introduced by somebody who is impacted by the issue in most cases.  he said.  Not only that. but ... you re talking about a heavily stigmatized issue in society. You re talking about sex and sexuality. you re talking about anatomy. and none of those things are things that guys feel particularly comfortable talking about. But it is something that affects them and the culture they live in. notes Barbara Risman. sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Sexuality has become so integrated into our lives. whether or not we re partnered.  she said.  That is directly related to women s control of fertility — and women do not control fertility in a world where abortion is not legal. ... Certainly. heterosexual sexual freedom is dependent on the ability to end an unwanted pregnancy. Also. a society in which the state has a say in reproductive decisions could lead to one in which the state has control over other decisions that could affect men more directly. Cohen said. Abortion law. abortion precedent is not just about abortion. it s also about controlling intimate details to your life.  he said.  So whether it s your sex life. your family life. other parts of your private life. medical care. decision-making. all of those are wrapped up into abortion law and abortion jurisprudence and abortion policy.  he said.Since the Supreme Court draft was leaked. Jacobson said he s seen more men speak out about abortion access and show more interest in his group s work than he has in the past several years.What remains to be seen. he said.  is whether or not it s going to catalyze the type of allyship that s needed now and frankly has been needed for a long time. ,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — Genetic analysis of recent monkeypox cases suggests there are two distinct strains in the U.S.. health officials said Friday. raising the possibility that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time.recent casesAnalysis from many more patients will be needed to determine how long monkeypox has been circulating in the U.S. and elsewhere. said Jennifer McQuiston of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think it s certainly possible that there could have been monkeypox cases in the United States that went under the radar previously. but not to any great degree.  she told reporters Friday. However. she added.  there could be community level transmission that is happening  in parts of U.S. where the virus has not yet been identified.The CDC said it is trying to increase its work on finding infections. and it s likely more cases will be reported.The findings mean the outbreak likely will be difficult to contain. said Dr. Angela Rasmussen. a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.It s not clear how long infections have been happening. and where. Some infections may have been misdiagnosed as something else. We don t really have a good sense of how many cases there are out there.  Rasmussen said.parts of AfricaBut last month. cases began emerging in Europe and the United States. Many — but not all — of those who contracted the virus had traveled internationally. and health officials in a growing number of countries are investigating.two recent ravesSo far. many of the reported cases outside Africa have been in men who have sex with men. but health officials stress that anyone can get monkeypox. One heterosexual woman is among the U.S. cases under investigation. officials said.The illness typically begins with flu-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes. followed by a rash on the face and body.No monkeypox deaths have been reported in the U.S. or Europe so far. But that could change if infections start occurring in more vulnerable people. like very young children or people with weakened immune systems. Rasmussen said.She raised another concern: Even if outbreaks among people are contained. it s possible the virus could take hold in the U.S. rodent population — either through pets or unwelcome rodents in homes. It s not out of the question.  Rasmussen said.Also on Friday. the CDC published an analysis of 17 of the first reported U.S. cases. The average age was 40. and all but one identified themselves as men who have sex with men. Fourteen had traveled internationally. to 11 different countries. according to the report.___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

sunscreenBut that doesn t mean everyone does it ― and even for those of us who try. we tend to overlook certain areas of the skin. One key spot that people often miss is the eyelid area. Dr. Karan LalApplying sunscreen to the eyelids may feel counterintuitive. All our lives. we ve been conditioned by labels that warn us to avoid applying anything near the eye area. and it has clearly stuck with many of us. Dr. Hadley KingStill. when it comes to sun protection. you definitely want to make sure you ve got your eyelids covered. And there are ways to do this without experiencing irritation and discomfort. Below. experts break down the function of sunscreen on the eyelids and offer their advice for choosing the right product and applying it for maximum protection.  It s important to apply sunscreen to all areas of skin exposed to UV radiation. and this includes the eyelids.  King said.  We frequently see sun-related skin cancers in the eye area. and in some cases. skin cancers in the eye area can be more difficult to treat and more aggressive. Dr. Papri Sarkar There are a few places that are really not fun to have skin cancer surgery. and the area around the eye is definitely one of them.  she said.  Using sunscreen here prevents that. Cancer protection aside. applying sunscreen to the delicate eyelid skin also makes a difference from a cosmetic standpoint.  The eyelids are prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from rubbing and scratching because the skin in this area is so thin.  Lal said.  Because eyelid skin is so thin. it is extremely susceptible to sun damage. This can result in droopy and crepey eyelid skin. Using sunscreen can reduce your risk of developing early-onset droopy eyelid skin. In addition to decreasing the formation of wrinkles on thin. sensitive eyelid skin. sunscreen can also help prevent dark circles from forming around the eyes.  Sometimes. it s due to volume loss or vessels under the skin and sometimes it s due to an actual darkening of the skin in that area.  Sarkar said.  Using sunscreen around the eyes can help to prevent new or further pigmentation or darkening of the skin there. All of the dermatologists who spoke to HuffPost recommended using mineral sunscreens when possible.  Eyelid stinging and burning is very common. especially after the use of chemical sunscreens ― such as those containing oxybenzone and avobenzone ― so I only recommend physical blocking sunscreens that contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for eyelid skin.  Lal said. adding that you can use your eyelid sunscreen for the rest of your face as well.Supergoop Bright Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40powder sunscreens There are now makeup eyeshadows that have sunscreen in them to allow for easier and elegant application.  Lal noted.  Many of them are combination physical and chemical sunscreens. so be careful and test them out to make sure you aren t someone who is sensitive to chemical sunscreens. He does not recommend using these products as primary protection. however. because reapplying tends to be difficult and they aren t particularly practical for the beach or other outdoor activities. I prefer using a tinted mineral sunscreen around the eyes. so I don t need a concealer and tend to use two layers instead of applying one thick coat all at once.  Sarkar said. Once you re set on your sunscreen product of choice. make sure you actually apply it thoroughly.  Always start with clean. dry hands.  Sarkar advised.  Use a small quantity at a time and apply in small areas and blend it in. I tend to apply to the skin right below the eyebrows. then the corner of the eye closest to the nose. then the actual eyelid. and then the undereye area. in If needed. apply makeup on top of sunscreen vs. beforehand.  Sarkar said.  You ll get the best color payoff and correction this way.  People who hate the feel of sunscreen or simply can t tolerate it on their eyelids (and even people who can) should remember the benefit of adding sunglasses or a wide-brimmed hat to your skin and your style.  Sarkar said.  I recommend polarized UV protective sunglasses that are in a larger size so it protects your eyes and the skin around it. chic accessoryBluestone Sunshields,Health News
COVID-19vaccinationWhite House COVID-19 coordinator Aashish Jha outlined the administration s planning for the last remaining ineligible age group to get shots. He said the Food and Drug Administration s outside panel of advisers will meet on June 14-15 to evaluate the Pfizer and Moderna shots for younger kids. Shipments to doctors  offices and pediatric care facilities would begin soon after FDA authorization. with the first shots possible the following week.Jha said states can begin placing orders for pediatric vaccines on Friday. and said the administration has an initial supply of 10 million doses available. He said it may take a few days for the vaccines to arrive across the country and vaccine appointments to be widespread. Our expectation is that within weeks every parent who wants their child to get vaccinated will be able to get an appointment.  Jha said.The Biden administration is pressing states to prioritize large-volume sites like children s hospitals. and to make appointments available outside regular work hours to make it easier for parents to get their kids vaccinated.Jha acknowledged the  frustration  of parents of young children who have been waiting more than a year for shots for their kids. At the end of the day we all want to move fast. but we ve got to get it right.  he said.,Health News

LONDON (AP) — A top official at the World Health Organization said the U.N. health agency assumes the coronavirus outbreak in North Korea is  getting worse. not better.  despite the secretive country s recent claims that COVID-19 is slowing there.At a briefing on Wednesday. WHO s emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan appealed to North Korean authorities for more information about the COVID-19 outbreak there. saying  we have real issues in getting access to the raw data and to the actual situation on the ground.  He said WHO has not received any privileged information about the epidemic — unlike in typical outbreaks when countries may share more sensitive data with the organization so it can evaluate the public health risks for the global community. It is very. very difficult to provide a proper analysis to the world when we don t have access to the necessary data.  he said. WHO has previously voiced concerns about the impact of COVID-19 in North Korea s population. which is believed to be largely unvaccinated and whose fragile health systems could struggle to deal with a surge of cases prompted by the super-infectious omicron and its subvariants.Ryan said WHO had offered technical assistance and supplies to North Korean officials multiple times. including offering COVID-19 vaccines on at least three separate occasions.discussed revising stringent anti-epidemic restrictions.The discussion at the North s Politburo meeting on Sunday suggested it would soon relax a set of draconian curbs imposed after it announced the outbreak in early May out of concern about its food and economic situations.claims to have controlled COVID-19The North Korean government has said there are about 3.7 million people with fever or suspected COVID-19. But it disclosed few details about the severity of illness or how many people have recovered. frustrating public health experts  attempt to understand the extent of the outbreak. We really would appeal for for a more open approach so we can come to the assistance of the people of (North Korea). because right now we are not in a position to make an adequate risk assessment of the situation on the ground.  Ryan said. He said WHO was working with neighboring countries like China and South Korea to ascertain more about what might be happening in North Korea. saying that the epidemic there could potentially have global implications.WHO s criticism of North Korea s failure to provide more information about its COVID-19 outbreak stands in contrast to the U.N. health agency s failure to publicly fault China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.WHO scientists privately grumbled about China s delayed information-sharing,Health News
the quest for that money is in limboJoe BidenRepublicansdamaging consequencesfunds to reimburse doctors treating uninsured patientsHouse and Senate Democrats have been wrangling over how to resolve the stalemate and even over which chamber should vote first. It s an open question whether they ll ever get the GOP votes they ll need to pull the legislation through the 50-50 Senate. and prospects in the narrowly divided House are unclear as well. There is still an urgency to pass a COVID relief package.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y.. said last week.  It s very. very much needed. Optimists hope the measure could start rolling once Congress returns next week. Pessimists say without quick resolution. Democrats may not have enough leverage to push the money to passage until early fall. That s when they could stuff it into legislation that will probably be needed to finance government — a bill that would avert a federal shutdown. a pre-election distraction Republicans will be desperate to avoid.The heap of sidelined Democratic initiatives has grown this year. a victim of GOP opposition and rebellions by centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin. D-W.Va. Casualties include bills on voting rights. health care. environment. taxes. gun curbs. abortion rights. policing tactics and an investigation of the 2021 Capitol storming by then-President Donald Trump s supporters.While lawmakers have approved massive packages financing federal agencies through September and helping Ukraine counter Russia s invasion. other priorities are dead or drifting. even as Democrats  days running Congress are likely dwindling. Republicans are favored to win House control in November s elections and could grab the Senate as well. and Democrats  frustration is clear. So far it hasn t moved.  Sen. Mazie Hirono. D-Hawaii. said of Biden s latest $22.5 billion request for COVID-19. which he initially sent Congress three months ago.  But then neither has sensible gun legislation. neither has voting rights.  The 50-50 Senate sucks.  she said.The COVID money is needed quickly. officials saythe U.S. is falling behind other countries It would be terrible.  Jha told reporters recently.  I think we would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life if that were to happen. Congress has provided $370 billion for purchasing supplies. for research and other public health initiatives to combat the pandemic. according to administration tallies obtained by The Associated Press. Around $14 billion of it was unspent or not committed to contracts as of April 5. the documents show. serious money but an amount the administration says falls below the ultimate need.Most Republicans are skeptical about added pandemic funding.  I have a hard time believing that there s not enough money and not enough flexibility already  to use it. said Sen. Kevin Cramer. R-N.D.Counterintuitively but unsurprisingly for the always perplexing Senate. one intractable puzzle stymying Democrats is immigration.Senate Republicans are demanding a vote an amending the pandemic legislation with language retaining Trump-era curbs that. citing COVID-19. have made it easier to bar migrants from entering the U.S.A federal judge has blocked Biden from ending those restrictions. Liberals want Congress to eliminate the clampdown. but moderate Democrats in both chambers facing tough reelections want to vote to retain it.The result: Testy divisions between the Democrats  two ideological factions. and knotty questions for party leaders about how to resolve them and push a pandemic package to passage.Their task is compounded by disputes between House and Senate Democrats over why the COVID-19 battle remains unresolved.derailing the money$10 billion in COVID-19 money collapsed We want to get COVID-19 done. but the only impediment right now is the United States Senate.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. D-Md.. told reporters recently.That s left Republicans waiting for Democrats  next move. I would imagine at this point way over half of our members will vote against this. no matter what. So the question is what do you do to get it acceptable to 10 or 12  Republican senators. said Sen.

This article is part of HuffPost s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.Outbursts of gun violence always get Republicans talking about mental health. It would be a lot easier to take that talk seriously if so many of them didn t have lengthy. well-publicized records of opposing government initiatives to improve mental health care.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is a perfect example. Last week s massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde was the state s sixth mass shooting during his tenure as governor. according to the Texas Tribune. After each one. he has said the tragedy called for government action to bolster mental health care. But in between the killings. Abbott hasn t been crusading to bolster state services. On the contrary: Just this past April. he approved a $211 million reduction in funding for the agency that oversees mental health programs. And Texas. of all states. is in a poor position to weather such cuts. When the nonprofit group Mental Health America put together a nationwide scorecard for access to mental health care. it gave Texas the lowest ratingNow. it s not hard to figure out what s probably going on here. The talk about mental health care sounds a lot like a dodge — a way for Republicans and their allies to distract public attention from the wide availability of guns. which the evidence suggests is a much more likely cause of this country s unique gun violence problem.Media MattersFox NewsChris MurphyAll that said. the U.S. really does have some big problems with mental health care. with way too many people in need of screenings and treatment they aren t getting. And there are actually some pretty good solutions out there.This briefing paper from the Commonwealth Fund has a list of options. This report from the Bipartisan Policy Center has more. This page at the National Alliance Mental Health website is full of links. each one to a different approach.The sheer multitude of possibilities can make it hard to focus the attention of either politicians or the public. But it s possible to simplify by dividing the potential solutions into two general categories:The most familiar problem with accessing mental health care is its cost.  In 2018. 38% of Americans said they didn t get mental health care because of cost. according to survey data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. That was actually an improvement from 2008. when the figure was 45% ― perhaps because the Affordable Care Act reduced the number of people without coverage. But. obviously. it s still a staggeringly high percentage.2020 paperFixing this is a matter of making sure everybody has insurance and then making sure everybody s insurance covers the care and medications they need ― in other words. moving closer to the kind of truly universal coverage schemes they have in most developed countries.expand Medicaidmore than 1 million residentsrefusedFinding qualified and appropriate mental health care providers has been a long-standing. well-documented problem. although it got even worse during the pandemic. It s why so many people can t find therapists in their insurance networks. It s why patients with acute mental health needs end up waiting for hours. even days. in the emergency room for inpatient psychiatric beds. It s why many people with severe mental illness end up in prisons — which have effectively become warehouses for people who needed treatment but didn t get it.A big issue here is funding. The money from both private and public insurers isn t enough to attract more mental health professionals into the field. The low pay also makes it harder to keep professionals on the job in what becomes a grim. self-fulfilling cycle They have to shoulder bigger workloads. increasing their stress and burnout. causing more of them to leave for other lines of work.One way to address these shortages is to increase provider salaries. which the government can do directly when it s paying for them through Medicare. Medicaid or other public programs. Other options include new subsidies for training on the front end (by offering tuition assistance) and on the back end (by offering generous loan forgiveness. especially for those working in underserved areas). Loosening license restrictions so that qualified professionals can take on more duties can also make a difference.But improving access to mental health providers doesn t just mean getting more professionals into the field. It also means putting more professionals in the right places ― specifically. places where the people who need mental health care can get it easily. An example would be working to make sure more primary care providers have mental health professionals physically in their offices — so that. for example. a pediatrician could call in a consult at the office rather than referring somebody to a professional who might be on the other side of town and have a long wait for appointments. We know that most people don t follow up on referrals. for one reason or another. and as a result. people don t get the care that they need.  Ben Miller. president of the Well Being Trust. told HuffPost.  If you bring care to them and you make it seamless. integrated. they re more likely to have those needs addressed that immediate moment. which is oftentimes much more effective for both the patient and their family. Miller. a veteran psychologist and scholar. is among the advocates who see such changes as part of a much bigger transformation of mental health care ― one that focuses on prevention and detection. as well as treatment. and that reaches people not just in clinical settings but also through schools. libraries and other community organizations.None of these steps could happen quickly. All would require sustained political effort to raise funds — or to move funds around and change regulations — because. inevitably. there are interest groups. businesses and institutions that benefit from the status quo and want to keep it in place.It s the kind of effort that Republicans eager to improve mental health care could certainly provide. although it would require paying attention to the issue even after the memories of the latest shooting fade.That hasn t happened in the past. But maybe this time it will.,Health News

The most seen was in 2020 when there were more than 6.300 suspected cases. Last year. Africa saw around half that amount. the agency said. The reasons for these spikes are not fully known but may be due to deforestation and the encroachment of people into the habitats of monkeypox animal hosts.

U.S. and Canadian regulators are investigating a hepatitis outbreak that may be linked to fresh organic strawberries.In a joint weekend statement. the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Public Health Agency of Canada said illnesses in Minnesota. California and Canada occurred after people consumed FreshKampo and H-E-B brand strawberries.The agencies said the strawberries were purchased between March 5 and April 25. They were sold at various U.S. retailers. including Aldi. Kroger. Safeway. Walmart and Trader Joe s. In Canada. the affected strawberries were sold between March 5-9 at Co-op stores in Alberta and Saskatchewan.The potentially affected strawberries are past their shelf life. but health officials say consumers who purchased them and froze them to eat later should throw them away.There have been 17 illnesses and 12 hospitalizations reported in the U.S.. the FDA said. Ten cases and four hospitalizations have been reported in Canada.Mexico-based FreshKampo. which grew the strawberries. said in a statement Sunday that it is working with regulators to determine how the problem occurred. FreshKampo said the label on the containers of potentially affected strawberries would have said  Product of Mexico  or  Distributed by Meridien Foods. In a statement on its website. Texas grocer H-E-B said it has not received or sold organic strawberries from the supplier in question since April 16. H-E-B said anyone who still has the strawberries should throw them away or return them to the store where they were purchased.Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause liver disease and. in rare cases. liver failure and death. Illness usually occurs within 15 to 50 days after eating or drinking contaminated food or water.

hundreds of cases reported to dateIn a public session on Monday. WHO s Dr. Rosamund Lewis said it was critical to emphasize that the vast majority of cases being seen in dozens of countries globally are in gay. bisexual or men who have sex with men. so that scientists can further study the issue and for populations at risk to take precautions.monkeypoxStill. she warned that anyone is at potential risk of the disease. regardless of their sexual orientation. Other experts have pointed out that it may be accidental that the disease was first picked up in gay and bisexual men. saying it could quickly spill over into other groups if it is not curbed. To date. WHO said 23 countries that haven t previously had monkeypox have reported more than 250 cases.Lewis said it s unknown whether monkeypox is being transmitted by sex or just the close contact between people engaging in sexual activity and described the threat to the general population as  low.  It is not yet known whether this virus is exploiting a new mode of transmission. but what is clear is that it continues to exploit its well-known mode of transmission. which is close. physical contact.  Lewis said. Monkeypox is known to spread when there is close physical contact with an infected person or their clothing or bedsheets.She also warned that among the current cases. there is a higher proportion of people with fewer lesions that are more concentrated in the genital region and sometimes nearly impossible to see. You may have these lesions for two to four weeks (and) they may not be visible to others. but you may still be infectious.  she said.linked to sexAfricaMost monkeypox patients experience only fever. body aches. chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak.WHO s Lewis also said that while previous cases of monkeypox in central and western Africa have been relatively contained. it was not clear if people could spread monkeypox without symptoms or if the disease might be airborne. like measles or COVID-19.Monkeypox is related to smallpox. but has milder symptoms. After smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. countries suspended their mass immunization programs. a move that some experts believe may be helping monkeypox spread. since there is now little widespread immunity to related diseases. smallpox vaccines are also protective against monkeypox.Lewis said it would be  unfortunate  if monkeypox were able to  exploit the immunity gap  left by smallpox 40 years ago. saying that there was still a window of opportunity to close down the outbreak so that monkeypox would not become entrenched in new regions.,Health News

Warm weather and booze often go hand-in-hand. Instead of hibernating inside alone on your couch or meeting friends in cozy cafes. summer brings invites to backyard cookouts. hanging out by the pool or meeting up in the park — and alcohol is a guest who usually shows up.These days. there are a lot of well-crafted. delicious nonalcoholic drinks to sip instead. but if you do want to enjoy some alcoholic beverages. there are some key ways that day drinking affects the body that you should be aware of. Family medicine doctor Dr. Sandra Luyindula says that regardless of what time someone drinks alcohol. they are consuming something that s a sedative.  Many people think that having alcohol before bed will help them sleep. but it actually does the opposite. disrupting sleep.  she said. adding that people are more likely to wake up throughout the night if they drink alcohol before bed. So does that mean you can knock a few back during the day and avoid sleep-disrupting effects in the evening? It depends on how much you drink.  The longer the time period between drinking alcohol and bedtime. the less it can negatively affect sleep. since the body has had time to process and eliminate the alcohol.  said Dr. Anna Balabanova Shannahan. an assistant professor of family medicine at Northwestern University s Feinberg School of Medicine.  But if large quantities are imbibed during the day and it is still in your system. it can still disrupt nighttime sleep.  Shannahan added that since alcohol can make you feel sleepy. it could cause you to want to take a nap. which could then affect how well you sleep that night.OK. so alcohol can still disrupt your sleep no matter what time you re drinking. But here s one way drinking during the day works in your favor. versus at night:  When people drink during the day. it s usually with food. Food slows down the absorption of alcohol and the effects of alcohol are decreased.  said Dr. Alicia ShellyThat said. Shelly also said that alcohol can negatively impact digestion.  Alcohol in general can increase the speed of digestion and put the individual at risk for diarrhea.  she said. Shannahan reiterated this. specifying that drinking alcohol at any time can impact the gut.  Alcohol can irritate the digestive system no matter the time of day. even potentially leading to stomach inflammation over time. which can affect how your body processes nutrients.  she said.Besides the gut. Luyindula said day drinking can impact your mood. too. Since alcohol is a depressant. things can go downhill later in the day.  No matter the time of day one drinks alcohol. it ultimately has a depressant effect. depleting ‘happiness hormones  like dopamine and serotonin.  Shannahan said. That means you may feel euphoric day drinking with your friends. but later. once you re home alone and that buzz is wearing off. you could feel down in the dumps.Drinking during the day can also put you at risk for dehydrationThe type of alcoholic drink you re likely to drink during the daytime will affect you differently. too ― think about how much sugar is in your brunch mimosa.  If you re drinking something sugary. like a margarita or daiquiri. the sugar slows down the absorption of alcohol in the bloodstream. so a lot of people end up drinking more to feel the effects of the alcohol.  Luyindula explained.  Also. not tasting the alcohol as much [in a sugary drink] can make people drink more.  This means someone may drink more than they usually would and at a quicker pace. While consuming alcohol in excess is never good for health. Shannahan said that regularly consuming sugary alcoholic drinks can be especially detrimental.  Added sugars in general can lead to health problems including diabetes. heart disease. inflammation and more. so it s best to limit high-sugar beverages.  she said. She added that any alcohol can lead to dangerous drops in blood sugar. especially for those with diabetes. as the body becomes focused on metabolizing the alcohol instead of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.  It s also important to be aware. particularly for those with blood sugar issues. that symptoms of low blood sugar can mimic symptoms of being drunk.  Shannahan said.No matter what you re drinking and what time it is. alcohol impacts cognition. That means you absolutely shouldn t drive home after drinking alcohol. no matter what time it is.  Alcohol slows brain activity down. so if you have a couple drinks at lunch. you can only imagine how your work productivity and quality will be in the afternoon.  Luyindula said. In other words. if you re going to day drink. don t plan on doing any work later. In general. Luyindula said it s important to be aware of how much you re drinking. no matter what time it is.  As of 2019. there are 14.5 million adults in the U.S. with alcohol use disorder. That s a lot.  she said.  Consuming three drinks or more a day for women and four drinks or more a day for men is considered binge drinking.  she continued. If this is something you re doing regularly. she urges you to talk to your primary care doctor about it.  We won t judge you and will get you the help you need. Otherwise. your drinking habit will eventually affect your family. work. health and finances.  With that in mind and now knowing exactly how day drinking affects the body. if you are going to day drink this summer. now you know a bit more what to expect. as far as your body is concerned. Cheers to a fun. safe summer! Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues? In the U.S.. call 800-662-HELP (4357) for the SAMHSA National Helpline.,Health News
monkeypoxDuring a public briefing on Friday. the U.N. health agency said there are still many unanswered questions about what triggered the unprecedented outbreak of monkeypox outside of Africa. but there is no evidence that any genetic changes in the virus are responsible. The first sequencing of the virus shows that the strain is not different from the strains we can find in endemic countries and (this outbreak) is probably due more to a change in human behaviour.  said Dr. Sylvie Briand. WHO s director of pandemic and epidemic diseases.likely linked to sexsignificant departureAlthough WHO said nearly 200 monkeypox cases have been reported. that seemed a likely undercount. On Friday. Spanish authorities said the number of cases there had risen to 98. including one woman. whose infection is  directly related  to a chain of transmission that had been previously limited to men. according to officials in the region of Madrid.U.K. officials added 16 more cases to their monkeypox tally. making Britain s total 106. while Portugal said its caseload jumped to 74 cases. And authorities in Argentina on Friday reported a monkeypox case in a man from Buenos Aires. marking Latin America s first infection. Officials said the man had traveled recently to Spain and now had symptoms consistent with monkeypox. including lesions and a fever.gay and bisexual men. or men who have sex with men.WHO s Briand said that based on how past outbreaks of the disease in Africa have evolved. the current situation appeared  containable. Still. she said WHO expected to see more cases reported in the future. noting  we don t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg (or) if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities.  she said.As countries including Britain. Germany. Canada and the U.S. begin evaluating how smallpox vaccines might be used to stem the outbreak. WHO said its expert group was assessing the evidence and would provide guidance soon.Dr. Rosamund Lewis. head of WHO s smallpox department. said that  there is no need for mass vaccination.  explaining that monkeypox does not spread easily and typically requires skin-to-skin contact for transmission. No vaccines have been specifically developed against monkeypox. but WHO estimates that smallpox vaccines are about 85% effective.She said countries with vaccine supplies could consider them for those at high risk of the disease. like close contacts of patients or health workers. but that monkeypox could mostly be controlled by isolating contacts and continued epidemiological investigations.Given the limited global supply of smallpox vaccines. WHO s emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said the agency would be working with its member countries to potentially develop a centrally controlled stockpile. similar to the ones it has helped manage to distribute during outbreaks of yellow fever. meningitis. and cholera in countries that can t afford them. We re talking about providing vaccines for a targeted vaccination campaign. for targeted therapeutics.  Ryan said.  So the volumes don t necessarily need to be big. but every country may need access to a small amount of vaccine. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever. body aches. chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body.____Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. and Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires.

Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone. pushed her. then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened. authorities said.The assault was recorded on another passenger s cellphone.The plea agreement said that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth. two of which needed crowns. along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches. Attacks on flight crew members. who perform vital jobs to ensure passenger safety. will not be tolerated.  said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman in a statement after the sentencing.FBIThe incident was part of an escalation in unruly behavior by airline passengers amid the coronavirus pandemic and led the president of the flight attendants  union to ask for more federal air marshals on planes.Airlines in 2021 reported more than 5.000 incidents of unruly passengers to the Federal Aviation Administration.Most were passengers refusing to follow the federal requirement for passengers to wear face masks while on planes. but nearly 300 involved intoxicated passengers. the FAA said.,Health News

Many people have experienced a migraine attack and don t know it ― likely because the signs aren t always so obvious. Only half of 40 million people in the U.S. who have migraines actually get diagnosed.  said Dr. Andrew Blumenfeld. a double board-certified neurologist and psychiatrist in San Diego.Some symptoms are obvious. like vision changes. sensitivity to light. and of course. the all-consuming headache. But during a migraine attack — even before the pain sets in — parts of the brain are losing function. which can affect other areas of your body. This is how symptoms can seem unrelated. And if you experience chronic migraines (more than half the days of the month). you will experience symptoms well beyond the course of the incident.Below are a few sneaky signs to look out for. plus some other important migraine notes to keep in mind.If you ve ever been unable to find the right words. you ve abruptly lost the ability to express yourself. or you completely forgot what you were talking about mid-sentence. this could be a scary (but common) migraine symptom.  Difficulty with speech. memory loss. confusion [are some of the most] surprising symptoms of migraine.  said Dr. Medhat Mikhael. a pain management specialist and medical director of the non-operative program at the Spine Health Center at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in California. Migraines can lead to dysfunction in the language centers of the brain. resulting in a loss of being able to express yourself. Blumenfeld said.  In the cortex — where language and vocabulary are stored — that part of the brain is switching off during this phase of the migraine.  Blumenfeld said.Many patients with vertigo tend to have migraines as well. Blumenfeld said.  There are a lot of patients in this particular population who end up also being migraine patients.  he explained.A vestibular migraine doesn t always include a painful headache. meaning that dizziness on its own can be a symptom or can be associated with regular migraine attacks.If you have a history of migraines and occasionally have dizzy spells ― even if some of those dizzy spells don t have migraine pain involved ― it can still be a migraine attack. especially if there is  no other disease to explain dizziness.  Blumenfeld explained.Tired all the time? Migraines may be to blame. Both before and during an attack. as well as in between attacks. chronic fatigue is a symptom of chronic migraines.  The fatigue can be physical. mental or both.  Blumenfeld said.  You can experience cognitive slowing ― slow thinking — as well as lethargy. If your brain is working slowly. and you re trying to be productive. you re going to get fatigued more quickly. It s all coming from the cortex in the brain.  If fatigue is a major symptom for you. Blumenfeld said treating migraines properly can help you get some of your energy back. Bring up this symptom with your doctor when discussing a medication plan.  Certain medications used to treat migraine can increase fatigue. including some of the older migraine preventative medications.  he explained.  You might get rid of the headache. but the patient is [wiped] out.  I think the most surprising migraine symptom — that people do not recognize as such — is something called allodynia.  said Dr. Huma U. Sheikh. a board-certified neurologist with subspecialty training in headache medicine from Harvard-Brigham and Women s Hospital.  This is a symptom where ordinary touch can begin to feel irritating or painful. She said that if you ve ever felt like your  hair hurts.  or you re suddenly sensitized to a necklace or glasses that you wear regularly. this could be  due to hyper-sensitization of the nerves that begin to portray normal sensations as painful. Anxiety and depression are  very common in migraine. and genetically linked — these conditions run in families.  Blumenfeld said.  In the period between attacks. [many people with migraines] tend to get a lot of anxiety — you may be anxious about the next attack. but you may have anxiety and panic attacks independent of worrying about the headache.  If you look at the incidents of anxiety and depression. the more frequent the migraines are. the greater the association.  he continued.  In chronic migraine patients. you see anxiety and depression more than a third of the time. Nausea. vomiting and diarrhea can be connected to migraines. both as symptoms themselves as well as in the form of a comorbid condition. Blumenfeld said.  In migraine attacks. what has been shown is that the emptying of the stomach is delayed. [known as] gastric stasis he continued. That can lead to those feelings of nausea and stomach problems.Before any pain sets in. there s a first phase of a migraine attack called the premonitory phase. Blumenfeld said. This is typically comprised of fatigue. neck discomfort. yawning. thirst. and food cravings. including chocolate cravings he added. carefully pointing out that the chocolate in this instance is  a craving and not a trigger. So if you suddenly have a hankering for a brownie or are ready to inhale a bag of M&Ms. this could be a warning. The craving. alongside the other symptoms of this phase. may help you to identify an oncoming attack before the blinding pain commences. giving you an opportunity to find medication.Many migraine attacks begin with nasal congestion. said Maureen A. Moriarty. a headache specialist and current fellow of the American Headache Society. Stimulation of pain pathways in the trigeminal nerve ― which is part of your nervous system ― creates the congestion. she explained.  Unfortunately. many people will often become dependent on decongestants in the attempt to alleviate this symptom.  Moriarty said.  Not recognizing this as part of the migraine. they fail to mention the symptom to their provider. It is important to let your provider know if nasal congestion precedes a headache. Control of migraine attacks can control this symptom. Ideally. you ll want to get to a neurologist as soon as possible. but Blumenfeld recognized that this can be an arduous process. Not many specialists are accessible. and symptoms can often be red herrings for other conditions. can be hard to pinpoint which experience is a symptom caused by a migraine attack and which ones are simply existing alongside it (known as comorbidities). For example. there can be crossover between symptoms and comorbidities. such as anxiety and depression. Migraines can cause depression. and depression can contribute to a risk for a migraine attack.This may mean doctors could have to treat you for multiple conditions. which is why it s important to find someone you trust who is willing to detail an appropriate plan tailored to your situation and needs. Whatever you do. don t stick with a physician who is making you feel like you re just  dealing with a headache.  It s not your fault. this is a genetic condition.  Blumenfeld said.  Tell your doctor you think you have migraines. ,Health News
the antiviral treatment PaxlovidCOVID-19 infections will continue to spreadThe nation s first federally backed test-to-treat site is opening Thursday in Rhode Island. providing patients with immediate access to the drug once they test positive. More federally supported sites are set to open in the coming weeks in Massachusetts and New York City. both hit by a marked rise in infections.Next week. the U.S. will send authorized federal prescribers to several Minnesota-run testing sites. turning them into test-to-treat locations. Federal regulators have also sent clearer guidance to physicians to help them determine how to manage Paxlovid s interactions with other drugs. with an eye toward helping prescribers find ways to get the life-saving medication to more patients.a nationwide surge in COVID-19 casesvaccine booster shotsthe coronavirus pandemicWhite House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha What has been remarkable in the latest increase in infections we re seeing is how steady serious illness and particularly deaths are eight weeks into this.  he said.  COVID is no longer the killer that it was even a year ago. Jha said that given the wider use of at-home rapid tests. whose results often go unreported to public health officials. the true number of daily infections is likely 200.000 or more — double the reported rate — which he said only makes the death rate plateau more significant.He credited vaccines but also a more than four-fold increase in prescriptions over the last six weeks for the highly effective treatment Paxlovid.Jha said about 25.000 to 30.000 courses of Paxlovid are being prescribed each day. When administered within five days of symptoms appearing. the drug has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease.Due to a change in the way Paxlovid is allocated to states. the number of pharmacies where it is available has doubled in the last month to almost 40.000. We are now at a point where I believe fundamentally most COVID deaths are preventable. that the deaths that are happening out there are mostly unnecessary. and there are a lot of tools we have now to make sure people do not die of this disease.  Jha told The Associated Press on Wednesday.As the summer months approach. Jha said the  number one  thing people need to do is to  go and get boosted  — and if they have a breakthrough infection. they should consult with their doctor about getting Paxlovid. He said gatherings of all sizes can take place more safely because of the tools available — if people make use of them. In places in the country where boosting rates are much lower. where the infection is starting to spread more. I am absolutely concerned that we re going to see. unfortunately. we may see more serious illness.  he said. Being vaccinated and boosted is a huge part of making sure that those kinds of activities are substantially safer.  he added.  And then. of course. we want to make Paxlovid as widely available across the entire country. so that if you do end up getting a breakthrough infection. you re still protected against serious illness. The U.S. has ordered 20 million courses of Paxlovid from the drugmaker Pfizer. and the country risks running out this winter if the drug continues to be used widely. The White House has been pressing Congress for additional funds for months to support purchasing more Paxlovid and other treatments. as well as additional boosters.While the administration has started planning for the potential need to ration the federal supply of vaccines if Congress doesn t act. Jha said right now his message to prescribers is that they shouldn t worry about the supply. I believe that we should be using as much as it s necessary to protect Americans now.  Jha said.,Health News
New U.S. research on long COVID-19 provides fresh evidence that it can happen even after breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. and that older adults face higher risks for the long-term effects. studyA separate report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that up to a year after an initial coronavirus infection. 1 in 4 adults aged 65 and older had at least one potential long COVID health problem. compared with 1 in 5 younger adults.Long COVID refers to any of more than two dozens symptoms that linger. recur or first appear at least one month after a coronavirus infection. These can affect all parts of the body and may include fatigue. shortness of breath. brain fog and blood clots.Coronavirus vaccines that help prevent initial infections and serious illnesses provide some protection against long COVID but mounting research shows not as much as scientists had first hoped.The veterans study published in Nature Medicine reviewed medical records of mostly white male veterans. aged 60. on average. Of the 13 million veterans. almost 3 million had been vaccinated last year. through October.About 1%. or nearly 34.000. developed breakthrough infections. Lead author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly noted that the study was done before the highly contagious omicron variant appeared at the end of the year and said the rate of breakthrough infections has likely increased.Breakthrough infections and long COVID symptoms were more common among those who had received Johnson & Johnson's single-dose shot compared with two doses of either Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. Whether any had received booster shots is not known. the first booster wasn't OK'd in the U.S. until late September.Overall. 32% had long COVID symptoms up to six months after breakthrough infections. That s compared with 36% of unvaccinated veterans who had been infected and developed long COVID.Vaccination reduced the chances for any long COVID symptoms by a  modest  15%.  although it cut the risk in half for lingering respiratory or clotting problems. said Al-Aly. a researcher with Washington University and the Veterans Affairs health system in St. Louis. These symptoms included persistent shortness of breath or cough and blood clots in lungs or veins in the legs.Infectious disease expert Dr. Kristin Englund. who runs a center for long COVID patients at the Cleveland Clinic. said the Nature Medicine study mirrors what she sees at her clinic. Long COVID patients there include people who were vaccinated and received boosters. As we have no clear treatments for long COVID. it is important for everyone to get vaccinated and use other proven methods of prevention such as masking and social distancing in order to prevent infections with COVID and thus long COVID.   Englund said.reportThose who had COVID were much more likely than other adults without COVID to develop at least one of these conditions. and risks were greatest for those aged 65 and older. Information on vaccination. sex and race was not included.Breathing problems and muscle aches were among the most common conditions.Older adults  risks were higher for certain conditions. including strokes. brain fog. kidney failure and mental health problems. The findings are worrisome because those conditions can hasten older adults  needs for long-term care. the report authors said.They stressed that routine assessment of all COVID patients  is critical to reduce the incidence  of long COVID.___Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner. ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

a gunman killed 19 students and two teachersthat number had risen to 95%at least 42 statesBut there s much debate surrounding the effectiveness of active shooter drills. And many experts have expressed concerns about the psychological impact of these practices on young children. countless reportsexperiencing severe emotional distressA 2021 studyTeachers who participated in the study recalled students  texting their parents. praying. crying  because they felt like  they were going to die  during these kinds of trainings. Parents noted that their children subsequently started experiencing  extreme reactions such as panic attacks and  downright fear  in response to innocuous things like hearing a fire alarm go off. Dr. David J. SchonfeldHe emphasized that frequent drills and discussions in anticipation of active shooter events gives children the expectation that these sorts of things will occur and that the world is an inherently unsafe place. This is particularly true with young children. who may develop a sense that there are lots of people out there looking to harm them. so they are in danger ― which shapes their mental well-being and the way they interact with the world.said Stephanie Marcelloa 2020 policy statementThe statement notes that the fear-based trainings utilized in some school districts have the potential to cause considerable emotional trauma in children and calls out high-intensity active shooter drills that include actual weapons. theatrical makeup to create realistic images of blood and gunshot wounds and extreme acting from pretend attackers. Students and staff have also at times been led to believe they are experiencing an actual attack. rather than a drill.  It should not be a surprise that there are reports of young children writing frantic notes while in lockdown. including one 7-year-old who wrote. ‘Love mom and dad  with marker on her arm and later explained to her mother that it was ‘In case the bad guy got to us and I got killed. you and daddy would know that I love you  after her body was discovered.  the text notes. In addition to concerns about psychological harm. the statement also points to the scant evidence that these drills effectively prepare students and teachers for actual active shooter events.One study cited  found that school personnel who completed active shooter training designed to train people to make decisions among various crisis response options (e.g.. whether to run. hide or physically attack a shooter) were almost twice as likely to misjudge many critical action steps in simulations compared with untrained school staff who relied on common-sense actions. may help them maximize harmThe AAP is not calling for schools to eliminate all active crisis drills. Instead. the group made recommendations to make these trainings less traumatic by conducting them more like fire drills ― that is to say. calmly. with a focus on safe movement and with no simulation of the actual crisis. said Jonathan S. ComerHe also advised school personnel and other adults to monitor students  emotional responses before. during and after drills and to provide support to those who seem overwhelmed.  Kids who have previously experienced trauma or loss. or who suffer from anxiety or mood problems. can be particularly impacted by drills and may need extra support.  he said.  Kids prone to anxiety can be encouraged to ‘buddy up  with assigned staff or other peers who are focused and calm. Parents should be encouraged to make sure their school knows if their child has experienced any major trauma or loss. Students with physical limitations. such as vision impairments. can also be encouraged to ‘buddy up  with assigned staff or peers who do not have physical limitations. Amanda Nickersonput together guidance The drills that have gotten media attention for people not knowing they are drills and that include props (fake guns. blood) and actors to get people to respond with different options like running. hiding and/or attacking the assailant are not advised given the high likelihood of doing harm.  she said.Parents and caregivers It s important to promote open conversations at home.  Marcello said.  Make it clear to your child that you re available to listen and talk. She recommended limiting your child s exposure to the news and being aware of past traumas that may come up. Try to maintain their regular routine and pay attention to any emotional or behavioral changes.  Normalize their emotions and keep any conversation age-appropriate.  Marcello added.  Focus on safety preparedness and how the community comes together to support each other and deal with the rare instances of danger.  Beyond the traumatizing effect. there are also concerns that these drills have led children to become desensitized to the idea of school shootings. In the Georgia Tech study. some parents shared that their kids had rather unemotional responses to active shooter drills. Other reactions included avoiding talking about the school drill experience as a result of being desensitized. ‘It was like nothing happened. It was the same thing as breaking a pencil  and ‘It s just kind of part of their norm. She s been doing it ever since she was in preschool.   When drills are implemented responsibly. over time many kids do report experiencing drills as ‘no big deal.   Comer noted. He believes it s OK for emergency drills to feel mundane as long as students are still participating and internalizing the safety information.  Sometimes it is more alarming to parents to think about their children needing to do this than it is for the students themselves.  said Nickerson. noting that many parents did not experience lockdown drills or active shooter drills when they were in school. She added that many young people may simply see these kinds of trainings ― if conducted according to best practices ― as just another set of procedures to follow in the unlikely case of an emergency.  There could also be some desensitization or resignation that this is the world we live in.  Nickerson said.  Although we wish that we didn t need these kinds of ways of preparing and responding. it is best to be prepared in the unlikely event that we need to know what to do to save lives. Schonfeld believes that the desensitizing effect stems less from the drills and exercises in schools and more from the horrific events themselves. He pointed to the seemingly stoic way many people respond these shootings today. A number of people have said to me. ‘This is our new normal.  I say there s nothing normal about children murdering children or adults murdering children.  Schonfeld said. Once we call it ‘normal  we lower our expectation to change it. and I m never going to be comfortable with that.  he added.  It s our reality. but it s a sad and frightening reality that we have lowered our outrage for something that s outrageous. and as a society we have to rethink that. We need to come together and mount the effort to come up with solutions. ,Health News
foot injuryshoeplantar fasciitiscomfortable shoesRecovery sandals are specific shoes you can wear if you re dealing with foot issues. and they re especially good for wearing around the house or outside when it s warm out. They re great even if you don t have an injury and just want a super supportive sandal to wear around.Dr. Chanel J. Perkins Recovery sandals are basically designed to help support your feet so you will be relieved from strained muscles. and they give you a quicker recovery from your workouts or something like plantar fasciitis.  Perkins said.  A lot of them are designed with different technology. like a foam foot bed. They have a very high cushion. almost like a cloud type of foam.  cloud-like shoeswalkingAnd if you re recovering from a foot surgery. Perkins said they re a good option to wear. Depending on the type of surgery you had. they accommodate any post-procedure swelling. too.  They would be good for someone who is recovering from a mild type of stress fracture where they ve completed. say. six weeks or so of standard medical shoe or boot therapy. and they re trying to transition back to a normal shoe. A recovery scandal is a good in-between of a high grade medical shoe or boot and a traditional athletic shoe.  she said. Though they re most often worn by people who are healing from various foot conditions or soreness. recovery sandals are good for anyone to have on hand. Your feet will thank you for the supportive footbed and easy slip-on design of these shoes. We asked Perkins to provide her top picks for recovery sandals that she recommends for her patients.

If you keep up with the latest happenings in the world of cannabis. you ve likely heard of delta-8 THC. weed light.  get high without the paranoia  legal weed. Below. experts break down the most common questions about the substance.Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol ― aka delta-8 THC ― is a psychoactive compound that is present in the cannabis plant. It is an isomer ― in other words. a minor chemical variant ― of delta-9 THC. which is commonly known as just THC. Dr. Rahi AboukBasically. cannabis plants tend to contain much higher quantities of delta-9 THC than delta-8 THC. so when we talk about THC. we re generally referring to the former. Both components are psychoactive. however. so they help give the drug its mind-altering or  high -producing effect. Delta-8. as it s usually called. is sold online and in brick-and-mortar stores in the form of products like gummies. vape pens. tinctures and edibles.As isomers. delta-8 and delta-9 contain the same chemical formula. but the molecules are arranged differently. Dr. Gregory L. GerdemanDelta-8 interacts with the same cannabinoid receptors in our nervous system ― known as CB1 and CB2 ― as delta-9 does. but their interactions are weaker. The effects are similar but it s generally considered to be less potent. said Dr. Peter GrinspoonGerdeman emphasized that delta-8 is not some magic THC that only produces positive effects. I strongly disagree with the branding that it ‘elevates  the user but without any of the anxiety or paranoia.  he said.  At this point. I have seen and heard very many examples of people. including experienced weed smokers. over-consuming a delta-8 product and going into a very distressed mental space. similar to going way too far with traditional cannabis edibles. Another major difference between delta-8 and delta-9 concerns the creation of commercially available products.As noted. delta-8 is naturally occurring in cannabis plants. but it s in very trace amounts (so small. in fact. that Gerdeman suggested that scientists might only observe delta-8 because it can be created by oxidative breakdown. which may occur in their very process of chemical analysis). Because of those small quantities. delta-8 products can t really be naturally produced like those with delta-9. Delta-9 products are most likely extracted directly from the cannabis plant.  Abouk noted.  However. delta-8 is likely synthesized and concentrated through a chemical process. Commercial delta-8 is mainly obtained from hemp. which is a plant in the cannabis family that is low in THC. Hemp also contains cannabidiol. or CBD. which is another isomer of THC. and it s fairly easy for labs to convert CBD to delta-8 THC.Thus. the delta-8 products you see online and in stores are likely synthesized from CBD rather than extracted from hemp plants because CBD is available in higher volumes.Here s where things get complicated. The reason more people have started encountering delta-8 in recent years stems from a piece of federal legislation that put its legal status in a bit of a gray area.said Robert Mikoslegalized hemp People view this as a loophole around the federal marijuana ban because the legal definition hinges on the presence of delta-9 THC but not delta-8 THC.  Mikos noted.  It doesn t cover other synthetic or naturally found chemicals like delta-8. Basically. enterprising entrepreneurs have interpreted the law to mean that products containing higher quantities of delta-8 THC are legal as long as they come from the CBD in hemp. rather than marijuana. And with the increased production of CBD oils. edibles and other products following the farm bill. supply surpassed demand. prices fell. and many entrepreneurs decided to focus on delta-8 instead.arethe FDA has issued warning lettersGerdeman noted that the Drug Enforcement Administration does not appear to have taken a strong stance but that local and state law enforcement agencies have raided delta-8 facilities in multiple states. Cannabis products are in this confusing realm where they can be subject to different laws or regulations. but chemists can always stay a step ahead of congress and make tweaks that fall into a legal gray zone.  Mikos said.  The problem is that lawmakers chose to define a drug based on a plant and regulate the plant. rather than the chemicals produced by a plant. 20 states have banned or restricted Now that this has caught on. a lot of states are scrambling to close this loophole.  Mikos said.  A lot are trying to go back and tweak their definition of hemp and not make the definition hinge entirely on delta-9. to instead cover other synthetic or naturally found chemicals like delta-8. ruled in a trademark case I think that some lawmakers have a reasonable argument that the U.S. Congress was not at all intending to legalize an intoxicating drug when they allowed the 2018 farm bill. which is a massive piece of legislation. to include that hemp language.  Gerdeman said.  I can certainly attest that many hemp farmers never realized that what they were growing was something that would end up turning into a drug that gets people high and can be sold to minors. In the meantime. cannabis industry entrepreneurs continue to take advantage of the loophole and sell delta-8 THC products that get users high ― both in stores in the states where it remains legal and online to consumers in places where it is not. Contrast that to the fact that estimates suggest more than 40.000 Americans are currently incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses. and you ve got a stark picture of the harmfully inconsistent reality of American drug policy. said Dr. Daniele PiomellimightAlthough there have been countless studies into the efficacy and effects of delta-9 THC. the same can t be said for delta-8 THC. So while it s tempting to say delta-8 is  natural  and therefore harmless. the scientific community hasn t fully researched the impact of this cannabinoid when taken in larger quantities than are naturally found in cannabis plants.reported over 100 reports of adverse eventsAnother concern relates to production and regulation. or rather. lack thereof.  There s no quality control over the process. so if you buy a vape or gummy that purportedly has with delta-8. who knows if it has delta-8. delta-9 or toxic byproducts.  Grinspoon noted.  It s synthetically produced and completely unregulated. which can be dangerous. Anyone could make anything called delta-8 and sell it. It s a shame because we might find a million medicinal benefits and other good things about actual delta-8 if we were to regulate and study it like we would any regular medicine. Although he sees value in delta-8 THC by itself as a safe therapeutic. Gerdeman expressed concerns about contamination in unregulated commercial labs synthesizing delta-8 THC. cleanly.He also noted that it s easy and common for labs to understate the amount of delta-9 THC that is also created in the process. so delta-8 products can wind up being much more potent than advertised.  I worry about super potent cannabinoids becoming more widespread because of the revenue stream that so many labs are getting accustomed to. and the tendency to compete for the next hot selling ‘legal high.   Gerdeman said.  Legalize and regulate natural cannabis. and the demand for chemically made substitutes will drop off dramatically. in my opinion. ,Health News
monkeypoxAfrica We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected. and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission.  said Heymann.That marks a significant departure from the disease s typical pattern of spread in central and western Africa. where people are mainly infected by animals like wild rodents and primates and outbreaks have not spilled across borders.Health officials say most of the known cases in Europe have been among men who have sex with men. but anyone can be infected through close contact with a sick person. their clothing or bedsheets. Scientists say it will be difficult to disentangle whether the spread is being driven by sex or merely close contact. By nature. sexual activity involves intimate contact. which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission. whatever a person s sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission.  said Mike Skinner. a virologist at Imperial College London.On Monday. the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Director Andrea Ammon said  the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact. for example during sexual activities among persons with multiple sexual partners. is considered to be high. To date. WHO has recorded more than 90 cases of monkeypox in a dozen countries including Canada. Spain. Israel. France. Switzerland. the U.S. and Australia. On Monday. Denmark announced its first case. Portugal revised its total upwards to 37. Italy reported one further infection and Britain added 37 more cases.Germany has four confirmed cases linked to exposure at  party events ... where sexual activity took place  in Spain s Canary Islands and in Berlin. according to a government report to lawmakers obtained by the AP.Madrid s senior health official said Monday that the Spanish capital had 30 confirmed cases. Enrique Ruiz Escudero said authorities are investigating possible links between a recent Gay Pride event in the Canary Islands. which drew some 80.000 people. and cases at a Madrid sauna.The monkeypox cases so far have been mild. with no deaths reported. Typically. the virus causes fever. chills. rash and lesions on the face or genitals. Most people recover within several weeks without requiring hospitalization.Vaccines against smallpox. a related disease. are effective in preventing monkeypox and some antiviral drugs are being developed. In recent years. the illness has been fatal in up to 6% of infections.Heymann chaired an urgent meeting of WHO s advisory group on infectious disease threats on Friday to assess the outbreak and said there was no evidence to suggest that monkeypox had mutated into a more infectious form.The U.N. agency said the outbreak is  a highly unusual event  and said the fact that cases are being seen in so many different countries suggests the virus may have been silently spreading for some time. The agency s Europe director warned that festivals and parties could accelerate spread.Still. at a public session on Monday. WHO officials described the outbreak as  containable  and cautioned against stigmatizing affected groups. saying the disease can infect anyone.The agency said the cases appeared to be linked to a monkeypox virus that was first detected in exported cases from Nigeria to Britain. Israel and Singapore in 2018 and 2019.Authorities in Britain. Spain and Portugal have said most of the cases identified so far were in young men whose infections were picked up when they sought help for lesions at sexual health clinics.Heymann. who is also a professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. said the monkeypox outbreak was likely a random event that might be traceable to a single infection. It s very possible there was somebody who got infected. developed lesions on the genitals. hands or somewhere else. and then spread it to others when there was sexual or close. physical contact.  Heymann hypothesized.  And then there were these international events that seeded the outbreak around the world. into the U.S. and other European countries. He emphasized that the disease was unlikely to trigger widespread transmission. This is not COVID.  he said.  We need to slow it down. but it does not spread in the air and we have vaccines to protect against it. Heymann said studies should be conducted rapidly to determine if monkeypox could be spread by people without symptoms and that populations at risk of the disease should take precautions to protect themselves.,Health News
Three doses of Pfizer s COVID-19 vaccine offer strong protection for children younger than 5. the company announced Monday. Pfizer plans to give the data to U.S. regulators later this week in a step toward letting the littlest kids get the shots.The news comes after months of anxious waiting by parents desperate to vaccinate their babies. toddlers and preschoolers. especially as COVID-19 cases once again are rising. The 18 million tots under 5 are the only group in the U.S. not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.The Food and Drug Administration has begun evaluating data from rival Moderna. which hopes to begin offering two kid-sized shots by summer.Pfizer has had a bumpier time figuring out its approach. It aims to give tots an even lower dose — just one-tenth of the amount adults receive — but discovered during its trial that two shots didn t seem quite strong enough for preschoolers. So researchers gave a third shot to more than 1.600 youngsters — from age 6 months to 4 years — during the winter surge of the omicron variant.In a press release. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said the extra shot did the trick. revving up tots  levels of virus-fighting antibodies enough to meet FDA criteria for emergency use of the vaccine with no safety problems.Preliminary data suggested the three-dose series is 80% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. the companies said. but they cautioned the calculation is based on just 10 cases diagnosed among study participants by the end of April. The study rules state that at least 21 cases are needed to formally determine effectiveness. and Pfizer promised an update as soon as more data is available.The companies already had submitted data on the first two doses to the FDA. and BioNTech s CEO. Dr. Ugur Sahin. said the final third-shot data would be submitted this week. The study suggests that a low. 3-microgram dose of our vaccine. carefully selected based on tolerability data. provides young children with a high level of protection against the recent COVID-19 strains.  he said in a statement.What s next? FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks has pledged the agency will  move quickly without sacrificing our standards  in evaluating tot-sized doses from both Pfizer and Moderna.tentative datessubmitted dataComplicating Moderna s progress. the FDA so far has allowed its vaccine to be used only in adults.The FDA is expected to review Moderna s data on both the youngest age group. plus its study of teens and elementary-age children. Other countries already have expanded Moderna s shot to kids as young as 6.While COVID-19 generally isn t as dangerous to youngsters as to adults. some children do become severely ill or even die. And the omicron variant hit children especially hard. with those under 5 hospitalized at higher rates than at the peak of the previous delta surge.booster shot___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

The Florida Department of Health in Broward County reported its first case of the monkeypox virus on Sunday.Broward County officials said in a press release that the case arose from international travel. and the person who was infected is currently isolated. DOH-Broward is conducting epidemiological investigations to notify possible exposures and offer potential post-exposure prophylaxis.  Broward officials said.  At this time. DOH-Broward has not identified any additional cases. The case in Broward County marks the third confirmed monkeypox case in the U.S.first confirmed monkeypox caseThe second confirmed case was documented in New York City on Friday. The city s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene confirmed with ABC News that a patient tested positive for orthopoxvirus — a virus associated with monkeypox.Monkeypox is a viral illness that causes fever-like symptoms. including headaches. fatigue. body aches. and a bumpy rash on a person s skin. The virus. belonging to the same viral family as smallpox. was first discovered in 1958 after an infectious outbreak occurred between two colonies of monkeys. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cases are rarely seen outside of Africa. but the virus has spread across numerous countries. including the United Kingdom. Spain. Portugal. Italy. Sweden. and Canada. because of international travel. The virus can spread in multiple ways. including through infected animals. person-to-person contact. blood. and bodily fluids. The majority of monkeypox infections come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. according to the CDC.Dr. Richard Martinello. an infectious disease expert from Yale. told HuffPost on Friday that there will be more cases of monkeypox in the U.S. I anticipate that over the next few weeks. we ll continue to see more cases being identified. but I do not expect that we will see exponentially growing numbers of this.  Martinello previously told HuffPost.Martinello said he believes monkeypox  does not seem to be as transmissible as something like COVID or the flu. The smallpox vaccine can protect people from contracting monkeypox. according to the CDC. Previously reported data from Africa suggests that the vaccine is  at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. Joe Biden said Associated Press,Health News
New York City Mayor Eric Adams has declared a state of emergency in the tri-state area over the baby formula shortage that s ravaging the U.S.Adams signed an emergency executive order on Sunday that will allow the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to prevent businesses from price-gouging on baby formula.Adams said the formula shortage  has caused unimaginable pain and anxiety for families across New York — and we must act with urgency.  This emergency executive order will help us to crack down on any retailer looking to capitalize on this crisis by jacking up prices on this essential good.  Adams said in a press release.  Our message to struggling mothers and families is simple: Our city will do everything in its power to assist you during this challenging period. nyc.gov/dcwpThe emergency order derived from a letter the Women s Caucus of NYC Council sent to Adams on May 17. In the letter. the group. which advocates for gender equality in New York. requested that Adams use his executive power to lessen the burden on mothers who depend on baby formula to feed their children.according to USA Today. The shutdown of a baby formula production facility owned by Abbott Nutrition. one of the largest U.S. suppliers of the products. after it launched a recall spurred the shortage. The company is under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. according to CNN.The Women s Caucus of NYC Council did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.,Health News
Asa HutchinsonCNNState of the Unionsigned that bill in 2019 The life of the mother. and rape and incest are two exceptions that I believe should have been added.  Hutchinson told host Dana Bash. He blamed his state s Republican-majority legislature for leaving those exceptions out of the bill. which only permits abortion in cases of medical emergency.Hutchinson said if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade ― the landmark 1973 decision that expanded access to abortion nationwide ― he thinks his state s abortion law  could be revisited. Bash pressed that such a reconsideration may not happen and. if it does. there would still be a period in the meantime in which rape and incest victims legally wouldn t be permitted an abortion. You wanted the legislature in Arkansas to put those exceptions in. They didn t. Your term is almost up. What makes you think you can change it? And if you can t. that means that ... 11- and 12-year-olds may be in this situation in a very real way in just a couple of months potentially.  she said. Those are heartbreaking circumstances.  Hutchinson responded.  We re trying to return that authority to the states. and to reduce abortions but. whenever you see real-life circumstances like that. that debate is going to continue and the will of the people may or may not change. but it s going to come back to the states  flexibility on that. He added that he believes his state s constituents understand the  importance  of these exceptions for allowing abortions and that he thinks it will be revisited. There s no guarantee of that but the public opinion does matter whenever you come to your elected representatives.  he said.,Health News

Over the weekend. the World Health Organization declared monkeypox ― a viral illness that causes fever and rash ― a global health emergency after outbreaks have been detected in more than 70 countries. The illness doesn t usually spread across the world. but it s currently going through multiple new communities. which happens when an infected person has close contact with someone else. Declaring a global emergency means that a coordinated international response is needed to address the virus. The last time the WHO declared a global health emergency was for COVID-19 in January 2020.Here s what you need to know:and morezoonotic diseaseswitch its name to hMPXVIt predominantly spreads via spillover events from infected animals to humans. Then. people can spread it via multiple different forms of close contact ― mostly through blood and respiratory droplets.At this point.  it certainly does not seem to be as transmissible as something like COVID or the flu.  Dr. Richard Martinello. a Yale Medicine infectious disease expert and associate professor of medicine and pediatrics. told HuffPost.Dr. Amesh AdaljaMonkeypox has a long incubation period of around 12 days. Its fatality rate is estimated to range between 1% and 10%. but Adalja believes the actual fatality rate may be lower. depending on where cases occur.  Monkeypox tends to be an illness that s not nearly as fatal as smallpox was.  Adalja said.United Statesin 2003transmissionSome monkeypox outbreaks have lasted for a year or so. but they haven t been explosive outbreaks that grow exponentially like we ve seen with COVID-19. according to Martinello.  People become aware there is monkeypox in their community.  he said.  When people get sick. they isolate from other people. and it helps to bring that transmission to an end. What s odd about the current outbreak is the way monkeypox seems to be spreading. Typically. outbreaks are very localized. but this one involves several countries.  The clusters that we re seeing currently. in multiple countries. are not linked to travel.  Adalja said.  There s transmission occurring outside of travel and outside of animal exposures. which are the usual routes that we see cases occur. It s not clear how monkeypox has been able to leap between certain regions. but experts theorize that once it jumps. transmission most likely occurred from the exchange of saliva. respiratory droplets and bodily fluids.According to The Atlantictwo documented cases in childrencisgender womenTreatment of monkeypox typically involves supportive care. Most cases are mild and self-limited. There are antivirals specifically designed to treat smallpox. but they are generally reserved for severe cases. according to Adalja. 85% effectivepost-exposure prophylaxisthe World Health Organization declared smallpox eliminated in 1980Usually. the vaccine is only given to people who had close contact with an infected individual. ideally within four days to prevent the disease and within 14 days to minimize symptoms.

Epidemiologists call this strategy  ring vaccinationand it s known to be an effective way to stop outbreaks before they can start.according to NPRindividuals who are at a higher riskRight now. it depends on government leaders and the public.

monkeypoxCases of the smallpox-related disease have previously been seen only among people with links to central and West Africa. But in the past week. Britain. Spain. Portugal. Italy. U.S.. Sweden and Canada all reported infections. mostly in young men who hadn t previously traveled to Africa.France. Germany. Belgium and Australia confirmed their first cases Friday. I m stunned by this. Every day I wake up and there are more countries infected.  said Oyewale Tomori. a virologist who formerly headed the Nigerian Academy of Science and who sits on several World Health Organization advisory boards. This is not the kind of spread we ve seen in West Africa. so there may be something new happening in the West.  he said.To date. no one has died in the outbreak. Monkeypox typically causes fever. chills. a rash and lesions on the face or genitals. WHO estimates the disease is fatal for up to one in 10 people. but smallpox vaccines are protective and some antiviral drugs are being developed.British health officialsNigeria reports about 3.000 monkeypox cases a year. WHO said. Outbreaks are usually in rural areas. when people have close contact with infected rats and squirrels. Tomori said. He said many cases are likely missed.Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa. head of the country s Center for Disease Control. said none of the Nigerian contacts of the British patients have developed symptoms and that investigations were ongoing.WHO s Europe director. Dr. Hans Kluge. described the outbreak as  atypical.  saying the appearance of the disease in so many countries across the continent suggested that  transmission has been ongoing for some time.  He said most of the European cases are mild.On Friday. Britain s Health Security Agency reported 11 new monkeypox cases. saying that  a notable proportion  of the most recent infections in the U.K. and Europe have been in young men with no history of travel to Africa who were gay. bisexual or had sex with men.Authorities in Spain and Portugal also said their cases were in young men who mostly had sex with other men and said those cases were picked up when the men turned up with lesions at sexual health clinics.Experts have stressed they do not know if the disease is being spread through sex or other close contact related to sex.Nigeria hasn t seen sexual transmission. Tomori said. but he noted that viruses that hadn t initially been known to transmit via sex. like Ebola. were later proven to do so after bigger epidemics showed different patterns of spread.The same could be true of monkeypox. Tomori said.In Germany. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the government was confident the outbreak could be contained. He said the virus was being sequenced to see if there were any genetic changes that might have made it more infectious.Rolf Gustafson. an infectious diseases professor. told Swedish broadcaster SVT that it was  very difficult  to imagine the situation might worsen. We will certainly find some further cases in Sweden. but I do not think there will be an epidemic in any way.  Gustafson said.  There is nothing to suggest that at present. Scientists said that while it s possible the outbreak s first patient caught the disease while in Africa. what s happening now is exceptional. We ve never seen anything like what s happening in Europe.  said Christian Happi. director of the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases.  We haven t seen anything to say that the transmission patterns of monkeypox have been changing in Africa. So if something different is happening in Europe. then Europe needs to investigate that. Happi also pointed out that the suspension of smallpox vaccination campaigns after the disease was eradicated in 1980 might inadvertently be helping monkeypox spread. Smallpox vaccines also protect against monkeypox. but mass immunization was stopped decades ago. Aside from people in west and Central Africa who may have some immunity to monkeypox from past exposure. not having any smallpox vaccination means nobody has any kind of immunity to monkeypox.  Happi said.Shabir Mahdi. a professor of vaccinology at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. said a detailed investigation of the outbreak in Europe. including determining who the first patients were. was now critical. We need to really understand how this first started and why the virus is now gaining traction.  he said.  In Africa. there have been very controlled and infrequent outbreaks of monkeypox. If that s now changing. we really need to understand why. ___Geir Moulson in Berlin. Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen. Chinedu Asadu in Lagos.

The first time I heard of Kegel exercises was from an episode of  Sex and the City  I saw in my late teens. After hearing Samantha rave about them. I walked away with the impression that their only benefit was tightening the vagina. And really. I reasoned. that only benefits men. Turns out there is so much more to it. But it wasn t until I had my first baby that I understood the importance of perineum health. After 28 hours of intense labor. my cervix wouldn t dilate past nine centimeters and my planned home birth became a nightmare as I was rushed to the Cannes hospital in the south of France. where I live. I was hoisted onto the delivery bed. surrounded by a team of masked strangers and my husband. James. Without asking for my consent. the midwife performed an episiotomy — an incision through the area between the vaginal opening and the anus — to make room for the baby. and I was instructed to push. With my son s head and shoulders already out. I began to shake from an eclampsia-induced seizure. My blood pressure skyrocketed and my heart flatlined. After medical intervention. I woke up the next morning alive but traumatized. After eight days of recovery in the ICU. I was sent home with my son. Oslo. in tow. I never wanted to go back to that hospital. but at my six-week postnatal check up. I had no choice. I walked through the automatic glass doors with my heart in my throat and choked back tears as I passed through the maternity wing. In the doctor s tiny office. with no barrier to change behind. I removed my jeans and underwear. and placed my legs in the stirrups on either side of the examination table. The 12 episiotomy stitches had healed. yet a deep rooted pain and shame lingered. As we finished the examination. the OB-GYN handed me a prescription for 10 state-paid perineum reeducation sessions. something I knew many French mamans and expats like me swear by for postpartum care. I had no idea what they entailed. but I didn t care. I didn t want her or any other doctor or midwife touching me again. Outside the hospital. I searched for a trash can to throw the prescription away.With the prescription in a garbage heap and no aftercare at all. I soon realized what can happen when these muscles are not strengthened again. I started peeing my pants. My urges weren t of the funny I gotta go right now variety. If I had to go. I went. There s nothing like trying to acclimate to a new country while wetting your pants in the middle of the street. I suddenly found myself perusing the feminine hygiene aisle at the local grocery store for adult diapers and pads. at the ripe old age of 27.Embarrassed to tell my French friends. I called my old ones in North America. and to my surprise they had all suffered from poor perineum health after birth. We swapped stories of our maladies over text. sending laughing emojis. as each one was worse than the other.One friend revealed that at four weeks postpartum she was hit with extreme pain and the feeling like her insides were coming out. An ER doctor told her she had a prolapsed uterus. This occurs when the pelvic floor muscles become too weak to provide enough support for the uterus. and it slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina. She was told this is a fairly common occurrence for women after they have given birth. We stopped laughing at the stories shared after that. New mothers have to navigate everything from breastfeeding and vaginal recovery to Cesarean healing and sleep deprivation. But countless other conditions including painful sex. uterine prolapse. constipation and urinary incontinence may be preventable with pelvic floor physical therapy. The more mothers I spoke with. the more I discovered that France is one of the few countries to take perineum health seriously. Here. reeducationhas been paid for by the government since 1985. In other countries. including America and Canada. women are suffering.When I had my second son less than two years after my first. my doctor gave me the same prescription for 10 free perineum reeducation sessions. and this time. I held on tight to it. After six weeks of healing and with my stitches removed. the midwife said I was ready to begin. She used what is called manual education. where she inserted two fingers into my vaginal opening to feel each muscle within. She explained women have nine muscles that attach themselves to the perineum. and that they weaken after delivery. She had me envision my vulva like a flower. with each petal representing a different muscle. then coached me as I held and contracted each. It was bizarre at first. but after just a couple of sessions. I could physically feel a huge difference. After I got the hang of it. I found myself naturally doing the exercises at home when I breastfed my baby. changed diapers. or sterilized bottles.Over lunch. my expat friends and I shared our stories. One friend said she was told to envision a ball being sucked up into her stomach. then bouncing it from side to side as she released her breath. Another friend explained that her midwife used the image of a grand chateau. in which her clitoris was the drawbridge. the labia majora were long velvet curtains and the moat. her anus. Whatever works.Though we all used different methods to reeducate our perineums. we were all in agreement about how important it is to be cared for after we go through something as life-changing as childbirth.Now having just given birth three months ago to my third child. I am back in the reeducation period. only this time I m using technology.I had heard French mamans swapping stories in the doctor s office about a brand new reeducation device — a pink electric dildo that measures perineum strength with a video game. Instead of manually gauging my strength. each week my midwife inserts the sensored device and I select the game to  play  from a tablet.I can be a race car. swimming fish or a rocket ship. It s similar to how I play Mario Kart with my two sons (now 4 and 6 years old). Racing my character around the track. I use my internal muscles to maneuver them around different cyber challenges all while clenching. contracting. holding and breathing my way through obstacles. If I have to take my vulva to the gym. it might as well be as fun as possible.Now with six weeks of reeducation sessions completed. my midwife said my perineum health is better than ever (and I no longer need adult diapers). Although it s been nearly seven years since I had my first child. when I speak to my North American friends with babies. nothing has changed. Women are still expected to suffer through the lasting symptoms of giving birth. So while the French way may sound a little funny. it s actually quite serious.  Not peeing your pants for the rest of your life  shouldn t be a luxury afforded just to those women who are lucky enough to be living in a country that takes postpartum health seriously.

Last year. it seemed as though coronavirus reinfections were rare. Yes. they happened. but the vast majority of people who had already had COVID likely wouldn t contract the virus again anytime soon. But recent data suggest reinfections are becoming more common. especially as new variants take hold. New York s health department recently published a report that shows a little over 4% of all COVID infections in the state have been reinfections — and that nearly 87% of them have occurred since December 2021. Washington state reported that 45.312 people had reported a reinfection since September 2021 — 2.3% of those were hospitalized and 0.2% died.The uptick in reinfections is likely influenced by two factors: one. that newer variants can evade the antibody response and reinfect. and two. that we re now documenting reinfections more rigorously and getting a more accurate picture of how frequent they are.Coronaviruses are known to infect people over and over again. In fact. it s widely believed that the common cold coronaviruses that circulate today (and reinfect people frequently) originated from previous coronavirus epidemics. Many infectious disease doctors suspect that. as with those strains. we may be susceptible to reinfections but that the symptoms will become milder and milder with time.  As get more immunity. as our T-cells diversity and broaden. hopefully our second reinfection will not feel as bad as the first infection.  said Monica Gandhi. an infectious diseases specialist with the University of California. San Francisco. We now know that antibodies. which work to prevent infection in the first place. begin to dip a few months after vaccination or infection. In addition. as the coronavirus mutated. it became slightly less recognizable to the immune system. Because of this. variants are able to outwit the immune system s first line of defense and reinfect us. according to Julie Parsonnet. an epidemiologist and professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine.  With omicron. we are seeing many cases in previously infected people. even when they had been vaccinated as well.  Parsonnet said.Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster. an assistant professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. said that people who recently recovered from an infection or got boosted may be susceptible to reinfection in about six months. Parsonnet noted she s heard of at least one patient who was fully vaccinated and double-boosted getting infected with omicron six weeks after their previous infection. A recent study from Denmark found that. though very rare. reinfections with omicron subvariants can occur in as little as 20 days. Of the 1.8 million infections recorded between November 2021 and February 2022. 1.739 reinfections were detected within 60 days. This doesn t mean that a couple of months after recovering. there s a good chance you ll get COVID again. In fact. a pre-print study recently found that infections in people who have already had COVID were 90% less common than in people who had never been infected. Getting infected on top of the vaccine really boosts your antibody levels and that should keep most people well-protected from infection for at least four months. Gandhi said.Identifying who may be more likely to get reinfected isn t an exact science — some people will be better protected and less at risk for reinfections depending on factors like theirage. genetics and underlying health. The rate of reinfection also depends on the variant — the type of mutations the virus has picked up — and the viral load someone s exposed to. according to Penaloza-MacMaster. The bulk of evidence suggests that COVID reinfections. in general. tend to be less severe than the initial infection. In the Danish study. almost everyone who had been reinfected with BA.2 after previously having BA.1 experienced mild symptoms for a few days and significantly lower viral loads the second time around — even those who were unvaccinated.Even though our immune system weakens with time. the components that keep us safe from illness and severe outcomes remain robust and long-lasting (even when dealing withnew variants).  Reinfections. especially in vaccinated individuals. are typically milder relative to the primary infection. because there is already an arsenal of memory T-cells and B-cells.  Penaloza-MacMaster said.Research suggests reinfections and boosters enhance the T-cell response.  As you would expect. a reinfection fundamentally protects you even more  from severe outcomes. Gandhi said. Of course. boosters are the safest ― you don t want to purposefully get reinfected.According to Penaloza-MacMaster. the severity of an individual s reinfection is also influenced by the variant they contract along with the dose of virus they are exposed to and whether they have underlying health conditions that put them at risk. But. often. it can be unpredictable. One of the key questions epidemiologists will track is how reinfections contribute to long COVID. We know that COVID affects many organs. including the brain. lungs and heart. Inflammation. which helps clear infected cells from the body. is a normal part of the body s response to infections. When the body kills off virally infected cells. it also destroys our own healthy cells.  Eliminating a virus involves a substantial amount of ‘collateral damage.  which is a main reason why long-term inflammation ― which happens during protracted infections ― is harmful.  Penaloza-MacMaster said. If and how reinfections contribute to long COVID and potential damage to our organs is unclear. Research has found that vaccination reduced the risk of long COVID in people who had a breakthrough infection. Gandhi said. And while the vast majority of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 recover well without long-term consequences. it isn t yet known whether this will continue to be the case after multiple infections. We don t know the answer to this question. especially because as variants change and our immune systems react differently to them. their impacts on the body many change.  Parsonnet said. Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication. but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

Kids ages 5 to 11 should get a booster dose of Pfizer s COVID-19 vaccine. advisers to the U.S. government said Thursday.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention quickly adopted the panel s recommendation. opening a third COVID-19 shot to healthy elementary-age kids — just like what is already recommended for everybody 12 and older.The hope is that an extra shot will shore up protection for kids ages 5 to 11 as infections once again are on the rise. Vaccination with a primary series among this age group has lagged behind other age groups leaving them vulnerable to serious illness.  said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. in a statement. We know that these vaccines are safe. and we must continue to increase the number of children who are protected.  she said.Earlier this week. the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer s kid-sized booster. to be offered at least five months after the youngsters  last shot.The CDC takes the next step of recommending who actually needs vaccinations. Its advisers debated if all otherwise healthy 5- to 11-year-olds need an extra dose. especially since so many children were infected during the huge winter surge of the omicron variant.But the U.S. now is averaging 100.000 new cases a day for the first time since February. And ultimately. the CDC s advisers pointed to growing evidence from older kids and adults that two primary vaccinations plus a booster are providing the best protection against the newest coronavirus variants. This always perhaps should have been a three-dose vaccine.  said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University. who chairs the CDC s advisory panel.The booster question isn t the hottest vaccine topic: Parents still are anxiously awaiting a chance to vaccinate kids under 5 — the only group not yet eligible in the U.S.Dr. Doran Fink of the Food and Drug Administration said the agency is working  as rapidly as we can  to evaluate an application from vaccine maker Moderna. and is awaiting final data on the littlest kids from rival Pfizer. The FDA s own advisers are expected to publicly debate data from one or both companies next month.For the 5- to 11-year-olds. it s not clear how much booster demand there will be. Only about 30% of that age group have had the initial two Pfizer doses since vaccinations opened to them in November.CDC adviser Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University said health authorities must put more effort into getting youngsters their initial shots. That needs to be a priority.  she said.Thursday s decision also means that 5- to 11-year-olds with severely weakened immune systems. who are supposed to get three initial shots. would be eligible for a fourth dose.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech currently make the only COVID-19 vaccine available for children of any age in the U.S. Those ages 5 to 11 receive a dose that s one-third the amount given to everyone 12 and older.In a small study. Pfizer found a booster revved up those kids  levels of virus-fighting antibodies — including those able to fight the super-contagious omicron variant — the same kind of jump adults get from an extra shot.Vaccines may not always prevent milder infections. and the omicron variant proved especially able to slip past their defenses. But CDC cited data during the omicron surge that showed unvaccinated 5- to 11-year-olds had twice the rate of hospitalization as youngsters who got their first two doses.Health authorities say for all ages. the vaccines are still offering strong protection against COVID-19′s worst outcomes. especially after a third dose.Some especially high-risk people. including those 50 and older. have been offered the choice of a second booster. or fourth shot — and the CDC on Thursday strengthened that recommendation. too. urging anyone who s eligible to go ahead and get the extra dose.Still to be decided is whether everyone will need additional shots in the fall. possibly reformulated to offer better protection against newer coronavirus variants.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

In the five months that Jennifer Anne Hall was a respiratory therapist at Hedrick Medical Center. the rural Missouri hospital experienced 18  code blue  incidents — an alarming increase in sudden cardiac arrest events for a hospital that historically averaged one of them a year. according to a police investigator.first-degree murderLivingston County Prosecuting Attorney Adam Warren. who launched an investigation 10 years ago. said Franco died of lethal doses of succinylcholine — a relaxant that paralyzes the respiratory muscles — and the pain reliever morphine.

at-home rapid antigen testMy friends were surprised by my positive result. it was before the current wave had really taken off ― at least. as far as they knew. Most people were lured into a false sense of security after the original omicron strain ripped through New York City. The numbers were low. or so we all thought.What likely happened ― and is still happening ― was that case rates were higher than official stats indicated. Thanks to the improved availability of at-home tests. more people are finding out they re sick on their own. The days of going to get tested are dwindling.Anavasi DiagnosticsAccurate case counts help people make informed decisions about their health. They re also vital for community leaders. hospitals and more. If infections are spiking. the government may need to allocate additional resources for COVID care in hospitals. clinics and potentially take other steps like asking people to wear masks again.  Blaivas said.  Staffing at your local hospital may be impacted by falsely low numbers and. if lots of people start showing up sick. they may not have the staff to care for everyone. as so many experts have stated Until recently and the advent of home testing. essentially all tests were reported to the CDC and various states. Policymakers and health authorities knew very quickly when COVID was exploding and when it was getting under control.  Blaivas said. noting that an inaccurate representation of cases may mean hospitals aren t equipped to handle serious illness and ICU admissions. Also. remember all of the shortages of masks. disinfectants and medications early on in COVID?  Blaivas continued.  When authorities are unaware of infection numbers. they cannot work to accumulate supplies or at least ensure availability when people start getting really sick in large numbers. That puts everyone in danger. Finally. accurate case numbers allow researchers to prepare future treatments and prevention measures. I m vaccinated and boosted and likely contracted the omicron BA.2 subvariant. since it s now the dominant strain. Thankfully. because of my vaccine. my case wasn t serious. This is useful information for scientists. Positive test results help give us valuable information with regards to how vaccines are holding up against different variants.  said Dr. Vivek Cherian. a Chicago-based internal medicine physician.  Ultimately. all of this information can be put together and influence health experts  ultimate recommendations and guidance. There are multiple avenues you can take to log your case. depending on where you live. The first. most logical step would be calling and telling your primary doctor.available treatment optionsHowever. Blaivas said that you cannot always assume that your doctor will report your case to the city or the state if they did not run the test themselves. Many at-home rapid tests have an app associated with them. where you can receive or report your test result by scanning a QR code printed on the test. In some cases. you will need to reach out to your health department.  Blaivas added.  This may be calling them. or for some states. you can go to the state health website and report a COVID infection by filling out their online forms. won t be the lastAt-home tests are a great public health tool. but they re not being used to their fullest advantage if the case isn t logged. Make sure you do that. along with taking care of yourself.Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

NEW YORK (AP) — Massachusetts on Wednesday reported a rare case of monkeypox in a man who recently traveled to Canada. and health officials are looking into whether it is connected to small outbreaks in Europe.Monkeypox is typically limited to Africa. and rare cases in the U.S. and elsewhere are usually linked to travel there. A small number of confirmed or suspected cases have been reported this month in the United Kingdom. Portugal and Spain.U.S. health officials said they are in contact with officials in the U.K. and Canada as part of the investigation. The U.S. case poses no risk to the public. and the Massachusetts resident is hospitalized but in good condition. officials said.The case is the first in the U.S. this year. Last year. Texas and Maryland each reported a case in people who traveled to Nigeria.Monkeypox typically begins with a flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes. followed by a rash on the face and body. In Africa. people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. and it does not usually spread easily among people.However. investigators in Europe say most of the cases have been in gay or bisexual men. and officials are looking into the possibility that some infections were spread through close contact during sex.Monkeypox comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox. Most people recover from monkeypox within weeks. but the disease is fatal for up to 1 in 10 people. according to the World Health Organization.___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

It started small. I was 20 when I began to experience the rapid blinking. head tilting and flinching. as if someone had just jumped around the corner to scare me.Soon I couldn t go five minutes without the paradoxical impulse to move while simultaneously praying to be still. Car rides meant constant flapping. banging my fist to my chest. involuntary shoulder shrugging. face grimacing. Meals were a separate battle altogether: The crunch of teeth chewing made me cringe. along with forks and knives against plates. my English bulldog snorting under the table. my Labrador retriever s bark. their high-pitched squeaky toys. the dishes being loaded into the sink. I started to eat alone at home to avoid possibly offending friends or family members.My senses felt elevated. like the noise of the world had been turned up to full volume and only I could hear it. Once. in a restaurant. a piece of silverware fell to the floor in the back of the kitchen in the crowded room. I jumped out of my seat at the clang. surprised no one else even noticed it. and received concerned glances in return.Little sounds that used to be inaudible to my ears now became unbearably painful ― the crinkle of paper as you unwrap a straw. the soft buzz of fluorescent light. the drum of a finger on the tablecloth. the jingle of keys. It all hit me at once.My therapist had diagnosed me with mild obsessive-compulsive disorder (along with my other neurological diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. dyscalculia and Asperger s syndrome) more than once in our sessions. yet I always tried to find another explanation for my behavior.Until I woke up from my MRI in the hospital. Patient suffers from severe tics.  A nurse s voice said.I required sedation to be still throughout the procedure. otherwise the rhythmic high-pitched beeping would have been torturous. Despite barely being conscious. I mumbled  not tics.  I had resisted the idea for months. ever since a close family friend who specializes in autism suggested it over the phone during my original episode. We had been calling them  myoclonic seizures  instead. based on research and one neurologist s estimate. It seemed easier to believe a diagnosis like epilepsy caused my distress than a mental health issue.According to the U.K. s National Health Service.  Tics are fast. repetitive muscle movements that result in sudden and difficult to control body jolts or sounds.  There is no singular cause for tics. They are most commonly associated with Tourette syndrome. However. OCD. ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are also known to cause them. They tend to be exacerbated by stress and a lack of sleep. My neurodiversity increased my chances of experiencing them. though I didn t have tics as a child or teenager.Before the severe motor tics. I had experienced sensitivities to sound and mild symptoms of OCD and general anxiety disorder. but never in public. Yes. I needed to type the word  words  a thousand times or else my story wouldn t be good. Yes. I compulsively tapped my finger in the car or else I feared it would crash. Yes. I obsessively reimagined basic interactions to analyze every detail and figure out how I could have messed up. Yes. I spent hours with my face pushed up to my bathroom mirror. picking my skin until it bled into scars. But my struggles with mental health remained private. and I was proud of that.Until one day. they weren t.Now. at 21. I wear Bose noise-canceling headphones to cope with the sensory overload that triggers my tics. Even if I didn t. it would be difficult to hide since I have no control over my own movements. Tic attacks are like having an out-of-body experience. and the more frustrated you become. the worse they get. Your body rebels against itself. hijacked by a chaotic force determined to overpower you. In the middle of a tic attack. I am scared and frustrated at my sudden lack of bodily autonomy. It s like whole-body hiccups.When I returned to school recently to take my final exams after weeks of remote coursework. it was with new accommodations. I wore heavy. black headphones and tinted sunglasses. I also sometimes use fidget toys for tactile stimulation to help me calm down. I wear my green sunflower lanyard to represent my invisible disability.In order for me to be my version of OK. I required tools that made me look visibly different. visibly otheredvisibly disabled. During lectures. I dread the subtle drift of eyes in my direction at the sudden twist of a bottle cap. the tap of a pen against the table. the professor s decision to pop a bag of Cheetos and crunch on the snacks in between the lesson. I am often treated as if I lack intelligence by strangers who witness my tics. I once had tics during a doctor s appointment. and the young nurse spoke to me the way she would talk to a small child about to get a shot. enunciating syllables slowly and asking my mother questions I could have answered.At home. my family walks on eggshells to avoid any noise that could trigger my tics. The TV is lowered and dishes are put away with great caution. I often feel like a burden to others because of my disabilities. I hate how they have to change their lives to make mine easier.But slowly I ve made adjustments to my new symptoms. I ve become more comfortable talking to friends about my tics after they inevitably witness them. I learned to keep the fluorescent lights off in my dorm and bought a dim lamp that didn t irritate my central nervous system. I avoid crowded facilities. decline invitations to events I know might cause an outburst. I receive extensions on homework assignments in order to reduce stress. even though I hesitate to use these resources. afraid the professors might think it s a cop-out.I still sometimes apologize for my OCD. but I try not to.Before the tics. I used to be able to hide my differences to make other people feel more comfortable. I taught myself how to look someone in the eyes and to speak at appropriate pauses in conversation. I mimicked neurotypical behavior to fit in with my peers at school and avoid repercussions (which still didn t prevent relentless bullying from kindergarten through the 12th grade). I ignored my immense discomfort due to sensory overload. I disguised my self-stimulatory behavior the best I could. I performed my life to meet impossible standards. For 19 years. this masking led to the belief that there was something deeply. unchangeably wrong with me.Tics took away my invisible safety net. As a result. I ve had to unlearn what I ve been taught about disability and mental health. Normal isn t the goal.By being open about my mental health issues. I m able to alleviate the internal shame I ve carried because of them. I can acknowledge and heal the wounds I ve ignored for so long.Unmasking has allowed me to be free from the expectations I thought I had to meet to be happy and successful. I may not be able to control the disorders I have or my symptoms. but I do have the ability to rewrite the narrative I have been told about them. and each time I advocate for my needs instead of apologizing for them. I learn to begin accepting myself just the way I am.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

Bria Bryant awoke from what felt like a 30-minute power nap. She d been under anesthesia for three hours and the LED lights in the hospital room beamed brightly as she gradually came to.She was lying flat on her back. and the soreness kicked in immediately. She was cold. as though she had been submerged in a deep freezer.  I didn t even know where I was at.  Bryant said.  I was like. ‘Wow. I feel like I just went to the gym. I m so sore.  Then. I open my eyes. I just see a light. then it clicks to me. where I m at and what happened. Immediately. I m like. ‘Turn. Me Over.  Bryant. a 28-year-old service worker in Baltimore. had just undergone gluteal augmentation with fat grafting. better known as a Brazilian butt lift or BBL. The procedure originated in Brazil in the 1960s and was pioneered by Brazilian plastic surgeon Ivo Pitanguy as a way to give people rounder. fuller-looking butts.  A Brazilian butt lift is really us augmenting the buttocks by adding fat. It s a double bonus for the patient because they have fat removed from areas where they do not want it and they have it added into their buttocks where they do want it.  Dr. Wright Jones. a double board-certified plastic surgeon. told HuffPost.  A BBL does add some lift to the butt. but it s really filling the butt. A more appropriate term would probably be a Brazilian butt fill. We re filling the butt with fat and we re adding volume. which inflates and lifts the butt. BBLs became more popular in the U.S. in the middle of the last decade. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) called 2015  another year of the rear  in its annual report. That year. there was a buttocks procedure — such as a lift. implant or fat grafting — performed every 30 minutes. Coincidentally. 2015 was the year after Kim Kardashian s infamous internet-breaking cover of Paper magazine. where she showed off the derriere that launched 1.000 think pieces.With the rise of social media. butt augmentation has been tacitly touted by influencers and celebrities who often refute any claims of getting work done. Notably. members of the Kardashian-Jenner clan have famously contributed to the procedure s popularity with their hourglass figures. Musical artists Cardi B. and K. Michelle have both talked about getting below-board butt injections. Blac Chyna said she got  something done  after giving birth to reduce a previous butt implant. In recent years. the BBL has gone more mainstream: Some patients are Instagram baddies who endorse products like detox drinks as a means of  naturally achieving  an artificial figure. Others are everyday people who simply want to keep up with the trends that are constantly promoted on their screens.Some find the pursuit of the BBL trend unfruitful and dangerous. for others. the procedure is wholly unrelated to the cyclical nature of pop culture. Rather. it s a form of health care. a form of self-love. or another means of simply exercising bodily autonomy. With social media and TikTok democratizing and destigmatizing cosmetic work. questions have arisen about how far is too far — and who gets to set those standards. Jones is based in Atlanta. which he calls  the BBL capital of the United States.  The plastic surgeon. who has been in practice since 2013 and was featured on the Lifetime television series  Atlanta Plastic.  he believes the BBL trend is not going anywhere anytime soon.Board-certified physicians in the U.S. performed just over 61.000 butt augmentation procedures last year — a 37% increase since 2020 — that amounted to $245.8 million in revenue. according to data from The Aesthetic Society. Between 2015 and 2019. the number of butt augmentation surgeries went up by 90%. Business Insider reported. citing data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.Bryant said that as a young Black teen in the late  90s and early 2000s. Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez were the women of the hour. Their bodies were perceived as the ideal. posing a stark contrast to the mainstream culture of flat butts seen on rail-thin white supermodels and celebrities. Bryant felt like she lacked an hourglass figure and wanted a natural-looking BBL to  feel more womanly.  I felt like my figure before did not go with my age whatsoever.  she said.When Bryant began searching for a surgeon in 2018. it was imperative to her that she find a board-certified physician to conduct the procedure. She perused YouTube testimonials. Googled reviews of various facilities. and read sites such as RealSelf. a health care marketplace where consumers research aesthetic treatments and connect with physicians. She was worried about the recovery more than the procedure itself. since two of her friends had told her aftercare had caused them incredible pain. She finally decided on Dr. William Schwarz at 305 Plastic Surgery in Miami. the city with the second-highest concentration of board-certified plastic surgeons in the U.S.. according to Business Insider. As an out-of-state client. Bryant said she first underwent an online consultation with a nurse that included sending in photos of her body and disclosing her full medical history. She also had to receive medical clearance from a physician about two weeks before her surgery and send related paperwork to the practice. The morning of the procedure. Bryant said she also had to undergo a series of evaluations. including a pregnancy test. a substance use evaluation and a procedure to measure her iron levels. Bryant became increasingly nervous. Hour after hour. test after test. she kept waiting. She hadn t had food or water for hours. since eating is prohibited after midnight the day of surgery. After getting undressed and slipping into the hospital gown. the nurses gave her an IV. She was finally ready. At 2 p.m.. the three-hour procedure began. Bryant woke up lying on her gurney. After a nurse flipped her over and rolled her out in a wheelchair. Bryant was placed into the care of Roxanne Ramsey. her friend of over eight years. Ramsey picked up Bryant in a rental truck. where she lay on her stomach in the passenger seat. and took her to the Airbnb she d rented for her recovery.The stiffness began setting in. Bryant was peeing constantly. Sleeping comfortably was borderline impossible. For the next week. Ramsey was at her friend s every beck and call. She couldn t find the Percocet Bryant was prescribed for her pain at any nearby pharmacy and had to drive 90 minutes to get it. I could not bend any type of part of my body whatsoever. Getting in and out of bed was the worst part of it all.  Bryant said.  Roxanne had to take me to the bathroom. she had to bathe me. At one point. I put a diaper on. which did absolutely nothing. It literally soaks through everything. You never realize how much you take for granted. and sitting is one of them. When it came to relieving herself. Bryant had to insert a urinal through a slit in her compression garment. also known as a  faja.  while Ramsey held her up.The purpose of the compression garment is to keep fat from migrating to other parts of the body and to help mitigate swelling. Jones said. He added that aftercare can vary depending on the patient and the physician. Healing is not straightforward.  Jones said.  Patients vary tremendously in the characteristics of their skin. the characteristics of the inflammation that they get from surgery. how they respond to surgery.  For the first six weeks. Bryant said shehad to wear the garment for 22 hours a day. with her abdominal skin pressed tightly and uncomfortably around her torso. Throughout the 12-week healing process. she received 40 lymphatic massages to help drain fluid through a thin tube inserted into the skin following surgery.During those 12 weeks. Bryant wasn t supposed to sit on her butt without a special pillow. The horizontal cushion was placed under her thigh. allowing her to sit down without putting any pressure on the new fat transferred to the buttocks. By week 10. Bryant couldn t wait anymore: She started sitting down normally again. butt to seat.  The actual BBL pillow itself is very uncomfortable because it s like literally under your thigh.  Bryant said.  Your feet actually start to go numb because the blood supply isn t flowing how it should be. You actually need some sort of back support while using it. Bryant paid $8.000 for the surgery and an additional $12.000 on aftercare and transportation — altogether. the procedure cost her about $20.000. But she said it was worth it. I like my results from my BBL. I do feel like I need a tummy tuck because I have a child and the liposuction [portion of the BBL procedure] didn t really get what it needed to get.  Bryant said.  It s very natural. Someone can t look at me and be like. ‘She had surgery  or ‘That looks ridiculous.  Bryant was pleased with her results. but she warned people to remember that bodies and trends change over time. She advised people to consider that what may be popular now might not be in 15 years.  Not all Black girls have big butts. Not all Black girls have full lips. I feel like it s moreso a trend to have that perfect Coke bottle body shape.  Bryant said.  Not all Black women are voluptuous. Ramsey posted a viral video on TikTok talking about her experience helping Bryant. describing the surgery center as  a trap house for BBLs.  She recalled watching waves of women being rolled out of the location and into cars. like a factory assembly line.  Literally. it was 30 chairs in the waiting room and every single chair was taken up. Girls were coming in right off of a plane. and their luggage was in the waiting room with them.  she said in the videoSchwarz. the doctor Bryant saw for her procedure. declined to comment to HuffPost. On TikTok. there are several videos of long BBL patient wheelchair lines at airports in the Dominican Republic.Miami and Atlanta. Airline passengers have filmed people flying after their surgeries. leaning forward with their tushes on their BBL pillows.  You hear people talk about BBLs all day. every day. but just to see the room just filled up with young Black girls being cared for by people that had no type of gentleness or softness with them.  Ramsey told HuffPost.  if anything decides to take a turn. Kim Kardashian has the money to look different. Meanwhile. these girls are getting these bodies you can t just reverse easily. For Antoni Bumba. the BBL phenomenon has personal meaning — online and off. In 2020. they transported their friend home after getting a BBL. Then last year. their aunt. who was in her early 50s. died following her BBL procedure in Brazil. Three months after her death. Bumba. a 24-year-old Congolese American social media influencer in New York. launched a viral TikTok trend:  the BBL Effect.  Using a note-higher version of the song  Knock Knock  by Atlanta rapper SoFaygo. Bumba embodies the character of someone with a BBL doing random activities. from exiting and entering Ubers to posing in a maternity shoot to promoting diet products on Instagram. The successful videos — the trend has been picked up and remade hundreds of thousands of times — have led to a merchandise line and viral clips with members of the  Gossip Girl  cast. The latest video series they ve added to the trend? The BBL wave. a ladylike greeting that shows off one s acrylics and can be added to their  BBL Effect  arsenal.Bumba said their videos were about celebrating the power of hyperfemininity. Contrasting hypermasculine. overbearing  gym bros.  Bumba wanted to present a new archetype for women and femmes who indulge in highlighter and blush. never miss their lash extension appointments and emulate daintiness. They said the TikTok trend really has nothing to do with endorsing the procedure. rather. it s a state of mind.  What the BBL Effect is. is it s the most beautiful thing about women and femininity.  Bumba said.  It is graceful chaos. That s the superpower of the BBL Effect right there. They also drew on their past to create their viral BBL persona. They recalled being outed as the only queer individual at their high school in their home state of North Carolina. Back then. they emulated a haughty attitude as a means of survival and way to lean into their personhood. All of these gorgeous Black women and Black women that I come from who naturally have these bodies. if it were not for their powerful femininity. I don t think I wouldn t be the person that I am today.  Bumba said. The commodification of a figure that many Black women naturally possess — as well as the distortion of what that looks like — reinforces the phenomenon of appropriation. Bumba recalls growing up being ridiculed and physically beaten for their full lips. only to watch their peers get filler years later. They recalled their sister being hypersexualized in Catholic private school for having a bigger butt than her classmates. I feel like there s a lot of people that see Black people on the internet being like. ‘You guys only want to use us for a trend.  and they feel like it s really repetitive. Well. this is what we re talking about.  Bumba said.  You make it seem like this sort of body is a fucking trend. then when you re done with it. there s no longer any acceptable space.   So you re trying to make Black bodies skinny jeans? You re going to tell me that my body is very 2016?  they added.  I feel like we should just nip the issue in the bud. which is actually racism. The problem here is not Black people. Social media has made it more and more difficult to figure out how you actually feel about yourself and what has been imposed upon you via the internet.Body dysmorphia is a disorder where people become so obsessed with their body s appearance that it begins to impede their ability to live life normally — and to have an accurate perception of what they look like. Increased time on social media can contribute to poor body image and even body dysmorphia among adolescents. according to a study published in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care in 2020. Additionally. internal research performed by Meta — the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — concluded  We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.  according to a Wall Street Journal investigation published last fall. Someone who s less susceptible to pop culture and its influence is going to be less likely to get a BBL.  said Dr. Nia Banks. a board-certified plastic surgeon who treats patients in the D.C. metropolitan area. The heart of the matter is that when we embark upon these procedures. we should be doing it for ourselves. for our own satisfaction in terms of body image and confidence.  Banks said.  I impart no judgment for someone who owns that their confidence in their body is part of their self-worth. Positive body image is a good thing. Positive body image is a good thing. and cosmetic surgery can help patients achieve that goal. But for some. access to cosmetic procedures is about more than looking good — it s a matter of health care. of life and death. For Yves B.. a Black transgender woman in the D.C. metropolitan area who asked to not be identified by her full name so she could discuss this sensitive topic. getting a BBL was part of gender-affirming care. She first started thinking about BBLs 10 years ago following discussion within the trans community. Her relationship with her own body was fine when she was a child. but discomfort came up as puberty started. Yves was uncomfortable with the societal constructs of gender. and she felt like people were always attempting to force her into a box. For Yves. the BBL was a means of body feminization. I really started developing things like body hair. facial hair. those sorts of things. I didn t like that at all.  she said.  I was always very thin. It wasn t anything that I was made fun of in particular. But it was mainly the secondary things that were happening during puberty. like my voice deepening. and things like that that made me uncomfortable. From the BBL to cut crease eyeshadow techniques. transgender individuals have pioneered and innovated beauty trends for ages. Inevitably. cisgender women end up usurping and commodifying those trends. profiting from them in competition shows and their own makeup tutorial videos.  I wasn t seeing a lot of trans representation directly.  said Yves. noting that she d later realize many aesthetics adopted by cisgender women were first pioneered by trans women.  I would see an aesthetic that I admired and one that I felt I could attain. one that I looked forward to growing into. This brings up complex feelings for Yves: On one hand. it s a source of pride and reflects the community s resilience and determination to make a beautiful life for themselves. On the other hand. it can be hard to see the masses capitalizing on transgender women s aesthetics. I think of femininity as innate within us and something that can be shared. even though we are usually attempted to be pushed out of it. When you see Beyoncé. Gaga. Janet. Diana Ross. you see us. But at the same time. you don t see us.  she said regarding visibility of Black trans women s impact on culture.  It s very sad to me that so many of my sisters die in poverty without ever having been included in that celebration. been able to make a living off of the things that we ve done and innovated. or been celebrated for our contributions to society. Yves started a GoFundMe to pay for her procedure in June 2020 and shared it with her 28.000 Twitter followers. although she was afraid of putting herself at risk of harassment. She hit her goal that August. This was something that I ve wanted for a long time. but it was something that I never thought that I would actually be able to do.  Yves said.  I took [the horror stories] into account. but they never deterred me. Nothing was going to be more dangerous to me than living in an environment that was foreign to me. that didn t feel like my own. Yves said her first introduction to body modification was hearing about silicone injections and shots from other Black trans women.  We would see girls who went to a pumping party. got shots. and looked incredible.  she said. recalling underground events where unlicensed individuals would administer silicone injections.  That s exactly what we want to look like. Years down the line. they would deteriorate. but when you re that young you don t really think about that aftermath. Yves said even trans women who sought BBLs from physicians years ago may not have received the highest levels of care. since the procedure wasn t very common and doctors were still learning the best ways of performing it. The way that it was perfected. we were the guinea pigs for that.  she said. Organizations that assist with funding gender-affirming care for trans folks. such as For The Gworls (which helped Yves) and Plume. are few and far between. The National Center for Transgender Equality found in 2015 that 55% of people who sought insurance coverage for transition-related surgeries were denied. NBC News reported. This ultimately can lead people to seek drastic measures to get care.Katya De La Riva. a 40-year-old transgender woman. died in 2015 after getting unregulated silicone injections at a house party in Santa Ana. California. De La Riva s death spurred an investigation and substantiated prior warnings from the Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County. which holds workshops about dangers of such procedures. It also points to how inaccessible safe. gender-affirming care is for transgender people. Approximately two out of every 6.000 BBL patients die from complications annually. per the ASPS. Jones said deaths occur for a variety of reasons. ranging from poor physician technique to the fact that some clientele should not have been cleared to undergo the procedure in the first place.In 2018. ASPS issued a warning in response to deaths that emerged as a result of fat grafting. emphasizing that fat should only be placed into subcutaneous tissue. Jones noted that the industry had since made changes to make BBLs safer: Physicians no longer put fat in the muscle of the butt. Doing so can cause a fatal fat embolism. which involves fat getting inside of blood vessels and traveling to the brain. lungs. organs or extremities.Yves made sure to do her research. prioritizing price and accessibility. online reviews. her impressions of the doctor during the first consultation. and the doctor s response when asked about their history with Black clientele. She gathered names of surgeons who had distinct before-and-after pictures of Black clients. knew how to minimize and care for scarring on Black skin. and understood the aesthetic she was going for. She had her first consultation in spring 2021. and the procedure took place in February 2022. In addition to a BBL. Yves received a breast augmentation and liposuction in her arms. Once I got into the OR. I just became really overwhelmed and started crying thinking about my sisters who never get the opportunity to do this or who died trying to do this gender affirmation with the best resources they had.  Yves said.Yves traveled about three hours to have her procedure done. The operation lasted approximately six hours. and she opted to stay in a post-operative recovery center for cosmetic procedures in Silver Spring. Maryland. for $375 a night. There. staff cooked her meals. changed her bandages and helped her shower and use the bathroom.The price of the operation. anesthesia fees. transportation. lodging and tools needed for recovery — including full-body compression garments in different sizes — totaled about $28.000. Yves is still navigating the healing process. and she looks forward to being her fullest self. Next. she hopes to receive facial reconstruction surgery. To me. cosmetic and plastic surgery in general is a net neutral thing.  she said.  I feel like people often put a negative connotation on it. Like. it s scandalous if someone has had it. It s just a tool. and I wish it were more accessible. There s a lot of times people will be like. ‘Well. you know. you re getting this surgery because you re insecure.  That s not really a notion that I care to refute.  So what if I did get it because of insecurity? How much of what we do in our lives is driven by a need to rectify an issue that we see? I think there is a misconception that we re trying to be cisgender women and that s not the case. We re trying to be ourselves and we are embodying ourselves. But what happens when these curvy bodies are used to build status and popularity? It s rare that you can read a magazine article or news commentary about bigger butts without a mention of Kim Kardashian s figure. Her Paper magazine cover shoot launched a zillion conversations about big butts. and her Skims shapewear line has reeled in customers who want the appearance of slimmer waistlines and lifted derrieres. Critics have often called out the Kardashians  curvy bodies — along with their hairstyles. darkly tanned skin tones and clothing choices — for attempting to mimic the bodies and aesthetics of Black women.Writer Wanna Thompson calls it  blackfishing.  In an article for Paper. she characterized the term as when non-Black women cosplay as Black women — copying the blueprint of Blackness. but dissociating themselves from its consequences. In the story. Thompson also cited her viral Twitter thread outlining the numerous influencers who have engaged in blackfishing. including white Swedish model Emma Hallberg. who social media users have accused of posing as Black because of her deep skin tone and hairstyles. In 2019. fans accused Vogue of publishing a photo of Ariana Grande in which her skin had been darkened so much that she looked Black. More recently. TikTok user @fannymaelee has been darkening her skin and referring to herself as Black. (TikTok has banned her account. citing  multiple community guidelines violations. )Beauty reporter Darian Symone Harvin said there s a perennial cycle of watching trends and styles that were once deemed  ghetto  and  unfit  by white mainstream America become popular. Notably. in many early 2000s films. white women were utterly terrified of having big butts. In  Bring It On  (2000). choreographer and coach Sparky Polastri (Ian Roberts) evaluates the athletes. telling Darcy (Tsianina Joelson) she has has  good general tone.  but not without snarkily adding.  Report those compliments to your ass before it gets so big it forms its own website! Lest we forget  Mean Girls  (2004) when Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) and the Plastics take a visit to Regina George s (Rachel McAdams) house. There. Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) critiques her figure in the mirror saying.  God. my hips are huge!  Or when all hell breaks loose at North Shore High and students  deepest darkest insecurities are made public:  Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass? Who would write that? Even the opening monologue to Sir-Mix-A-Lot s 1992 hit  Baby Got Back  begins with a white woman disparaging a Black woman by saying.  Oh. my. god. Becky. look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys  girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her. because she looks like a total prostitute. OK? ... She s just so Black! Just so Black. In the eyes of white women. big butts were often associated with promiscuity and Blackness and invoked a slew of hypersexualized. racist connotations. For centuries. our bodies have often been commodified and exploited. Saartjie  Sarah  Baartman was a Khoisan woman from South Africa who was exhibited by showmen throughout Europe in the 19th century for her protruding butt. a spectacle of white entertainment. We always talk about these ebbs and flows that we see within pop culture.  Harvin said.  There were other points in time in which big butts were glamorized. We have always seen it throughout rap. In some ways. though. it s almost picking up more on how white people have decided to really choose which day they are feeling like they want to consume and enjoy big butts or not. Yet the barrier prohibiting us from capitalizing off of our natural. Black features is none other than misogynoir. What I have realized is that the motivations vary and are very much connected to the influences or experiences of our own environments. our own relationships. and our own proximity to whiteness.  Harvin said.  By whiteness. I mean the sense of our proximity to beauty standards that actually more fall in line with Eurocentric beauty standards — and how the evolution of beauty standards has been influenced by Black women. We have seen white women pick up on not just the shapes of our bodies. but also our beauty regimens. our styles and our practices. Many Black women have no interest in trying to conform to an ever-shifting beauty standard that is predicated on whiteness and anti-Blackness. Although blackfishing can be the underbelly of conversations about big butts in the media. to some. body modification is merely a means of increasing capital. Baby Got Back  morphed into a new anthem with Nicki Minaj s 2014 hit  Anaconda.  another song all about big butts. The rapper has never shied away from the cosmetic surgery conversation. and in a March interview with Joe Budden. Minaj talked about receiving butt injections from a  random person.  The industry s emphasis on big butts made it hard for her to navigate. Lil  Wayne and other male rappers put women with big butts on a pedestal. she said. and it made her feel as though she wasn t  complete or good enough.  Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B has been transparent about the work done on her body. in a famous tweet. Cardi wrote that one should invest in a BBL first. then their teeth. She had cosmetic enhancements not only as a form of social capital. but in an effort to make more money and embody industry standards.But you don t need to be famous to see cosmetic surgery as a way to gain clout. Meriah Lewis. a 30-year-old who works in the beauty service industry. said she decided to get a BBL because she needed a  comeback  after moving to Atlanta. which is frequently referred to as Black Hollywood.She was a divorcée and single mother. and she felt pressure to fit in with the city s flamboyant flex culture. replete with flashy rappers and vibrant nightlife. She got her breasts augmented in 2016 and found a plastic surgery group on Facebook. which first piqued her interest in a BBL. She said it was impossible to get noticed without a BBL. Lewis said.  I m not a big nighttime person anyway. but when I did go out I felt like. ‘Oh. I want to go home. I don t fit in here.  Lewis planned to pay for the procedure with her tax return. but her boyfriend stepped in and funded it. She went to Miami for her first BBL in 2017. which cost approximately $6.000. But she wanted more. Lewis felt like her legs didn t match up with her body. Without someone to pay for it the second time. she went to the Dominican Republic. where BBLs are relatively cheap. and paid in installments. She is not sure if her doctor was board-certified.The second BBL felt different. She garnered a lot of unwanted attention. On dates. men would immediately write her off. saying.  You look like a golddigger.  or approach her aggressively. asking.  What club you dance at?  Her mother told her that people back home in Alabama were gossiping about her. She spiraled into a depression. I couldn t make plans with anyone.  Lewis said.  It was like. ‘There s Tyler s mom with the big butt. We re not going to invite her over. You don t have a husband and you re walking around with this big huge butt. Like. come on. you re not invited.  I m trying to climb the social ladder. Neyleen Ashley is a social media influencer who showcases her journey to remove her cosmetic enhancements. including a BBL. on TikTok. Appearance has always been a priority for the 33-year-old. who was raised in and still lives in Miami.  Everyone is beautiful and to the nines.  Ashley said.  You can be going to the grocery store and it s like. everyone s done up. My grandma always told me never leave the house without lipstick. Similar to other women in her Cuban family. Ashley said she always had a curvaceous body — but was flat-chested. When she began building her social media presence. she felt like her body lacked the  wow factor.  She felt a certain pressure to keep up and push the limits. Even as an adult. she said she  freaks out  if she sees any sort of fluctuation in her weight or appearance.She got a breast augmentation at age 18. A decade later. in 2017. Ashley underwent her first butt-enhancing procedure. She was hoping a bigger butt would help her social media career pick up. The Kardashians  rise to prominence. coupled with the Worldstar era. she said. created a particular standard:  Well. you know. if I want to make it. this is kind of what I have to do and how I have to look. Ashley said she remained awake during her first procedure. She recalled that the people performing it only applied local anesthesia to the injection site. which is atypical for a BBL. Ultimately. Ashley was displeased with her results. so she wanted to go bigger.  I went to like the craziest. most sketchiest places. whoever was going to do it for me the cheapest.  she said.  I found out the week that I went to go have it done that my doctor had like two deaths within the past year. and he was hiding in a different location. Crazy enough. I still decided to go through that because that s how desperate I was. Ashley said she later spoke with someone at the clinic who convinced her to get a full BBL because the previous treatment had  missed a spot  and she could opt for  more of a shelf.  After that second procedure. she started to hear some unfavorable commentary. [My family] would tell me. ‘Your butt just looks so big. It doesn t look natural.   Ashley said.  I think that that affected me too. but I just kind of was like. ‘I ‘m getting likes on Instagram because of it.  In the years that followed. Ashley became a spectacle. Onlookers glared at her when she went out with her kids. She remembers wearing sweaters around her waist to divert the lingering eyes in the grocery store. The snickering and whispers made her feel like a shell of her typical outgoing. bubbly self. When she visited her father in Texas. she remembers people gawking at her. On social media. where she had high hopes of a wow factor. she got comments that referred to her as  ant butt  and  plastic.  She began to reflect on any and all cosmetic procedures she had done. Do I really look like this plastic? Do I really look this fake? Do I look like the ant emoji?  she said.  I feel like I didn t really realize how big and how much filler I had put into my lips. When I got my lips dissolved. I saw how happy I looked and how my smile was brighter and I looked more like myself. like I had aged [backwards].  In June 2021. Ashley spoke to someone about a BBL reversal. She asked what the safest method would be. and he ultimately injected an unknown acid into her butt. Ashley was in immense pain. but she said she saw results within a week. The ASPS has standards for butt lifts. but there is no standardized method to perform a BBL reduction.But Dr. Darryl J. Blinski. a Miami-based doctor who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and has been reducing misshapen buttocks for 10 years. said a reversal technique like Ashley experienced was likely unsafe. Blinski said he couldn t be sure what product was used in Ashley s reversal. but assumed deoxycholic acid. which is meant to melt fat around the chin. was used. Even a low dose of it can cause an inflammatory response.  Can you imagine them injecting high amounts in the buttocks?  he said.  I would not recommend that at all. I think it s very bad medicine. On average. Blinski performs three to five BBL reversals a month. and they can cost anywhere from $6.500 to $12.500. He said there are two main reasons for BBL reductions: In some cases. he said. a physician was inexperienced and incompetent and couldn t get the ratios right. In other cases. people wanted massive. unrealistic butts. and ultimately were unhappy with results.Blinski said it can take multiple reversal procedures to get a desired shape. His technique involves him using a small liposuction tube to reduce. transfer. and reshape fat based on markings he and the patient have agreed upon. You re sculpting almost like [you would with] clay except you re using living tissue. You follow your ideal markings in your mind and start the liposuction very slowly to reduce the areas if it s a pure buttock reduction.  Blinski said. In retrospect. Ashley said her biggest regret was not going to a board-certified doctor for the initial procedures. She believes a physician would have been honest with her and told her she didn t really need to get work done — and that she would have listened. Now. as an influencer. she s on a journey to share her experience with others. The most important thing is just owning your truth. Whether you want to share it or not. but you can t deny it. either. That s why I don t respect the Kardashian universe.  Ashley said.  I feel like the Kardashian culture. what it has done is it has made it acceptable to get a million things done and not be honest and forthcoming about the things that you ve done. That s why I ve taken a completely different turn when it comes to what I ve done. In a TikTok posted earlier this month. Ashley said she removed her BBL while  on a journey to go back to natural  and  has never been happier.  She added that although she hears people say they regret the work they got done. reversals are rarely discussed. Lewis. the single mother who got a BBL after moving to Atlanta. also regrets the procedure. Despite trying to climb the proverbial social ladder. Lewis was ostracized for her body. In her words. she was tired of being penalized for looking like a video vixen. She ultimately decided to reverse her BBL. Lewis started by losing some weight. then opted for a gastric sleeve procedure. Blinski said the gastric sleeve is not site-specific. it is for total body weight loss. The procedure cost $5.200. and she also had to pay for flights. medication and child care while she recovered.Lewis moved back home to Montgomery. Alabama. She s currently a few months post-op and feeling much better about her body and sense of self. She said leaving Atlanta and its social pressures is the best thing she could ve done for herself. Now. she s dissuading her 22-year-old stepsister from following in her footsteps by getting the procedure done.  I got greedy. I wasn t self-aware of the aftermath of this stuff. I should have just left it alone when I did the first BBL and been grateful for what the doc was able to do.  Lewis said.  You come to Atlanta in a Honda. now you see everybody in a Benz and it s like. ‘OK. I m gonna get me a Benz in six months.  I could have just kept it like that. But no. I wanted more. ,Health News

[Theraguns] tend to be best suited for muscle aches and pains as well as myofascial release to treat areas of tension. knots. adhesions from trauma and tightness.  Hamula recommends checking in with your own doctor before self-treating an acute or chronic injury beyond typical muscle soreness. or if you have a condition like osteoporosis or varicose veins or are pregnant. Tools like the Theragun should never be used for infections. fractures. dislocations or tendon ruptures. When it comes to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. AKA e-stim devices like the Ovira Noha. Hamula recommends them for chronic conditions like lower back and muscular pain.

The nation has reached a heartbreaking milestone of 1 million confirmed deaths from COVID-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began over two years ago.An average of 300 people are still dying each day from COVID-19 — most of whom are unvaccinated — even as safe and effective vaccines have been available to prevent severe illness or death from the virus.Joe BidenThe president asked Americans to  remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible. cases have begun to rise again. doubling1 in 4 — people nationwide have still not gotten a single doseof a vaccine against the coronavirus. according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. About  with two doses of Pfizer s or Moderna s vaccines or the single dose of Johnson & Johnson s. And about  — which health experts say provides the best protection against the latest variants — have not gotten theirs.Throughout the deadly pandemic. right-wing media pundits have spread misinformation on the vaccines  safety and effectiveness. and Republican lawmakers and officials have fought efforts to mandate vaccines for workers.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky noted in February that unvaccinated people were 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted.Meanwhile. federal and state-level guidelines have dramatically loosened virus-related restrictions in recent months. with many states lifting mask mandates for schools and a court ruling ending a national mask mandate for planes and other travel. (The CDC still recommends masking on planes. trains and buses.)People with disabilities have warned that the millions of Americans with chronic health conditions. including those who are immunocompromised or have heart or respiratory issues. are still vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19.Throughout the pandemic.

U.S. regulators on Tuesday authorized a COVID-19 booster shot for healthy 5- to 11-year-olds. hoping an extra vaccine dose will enhance their protection as infections once again creep upward.Everyone 12 and older already was supposed to get one booster dose for the best protection against the newest coronavirus variants ― and some people. including those 50 and older. can choose a second booster.The Food and Drug Administration s authorization now opens a third shot to elementary-age kids. too — at least five months after their last dose.There is one more hurdle: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must decide whether to formally recommend the booster for this age group. The CDC s scientific advisers are scheduled to meet on Thursday.Pfizer s shot is the only COVID-19 vaccine available for children of any age in the U.S. Those ages 5 to 11 receive one-third of the dose given to everyone 12 and older.Whether elementary-age children need a booster has been overshadowed by parents  outcry to vaccinate even younger tots. those under 5 ― the only group not yet eligible in the U.S. Both Pfizer and rival Moderna have been studying their shots in the youngest children. and the FDA is expected to evaluate data from one or both companies sometime next month.For the 5- to 11-year-olds. it s not clear how much demand there will be for boosters. Only about 30% of that age group have had the initial two Pfizer doses since vaccinations opened to them in November.But in a small study. Pfizer found a booster revved up those kids  levels of virus-fighting antibodies ― including those able to fight omicron ― the same kind of jump adults get from an extra shot.While the coronavirus is more dangerous to adults than to children. youngsters can get severely ill ― and more than 350 children ages 5 to 11 have died. according to CDC s count.Adding to public confusion. the CDC estimates 3 out of every 4 U.S. children of all ages have been infected with the coronavirus since the pandemic s start ― many of them during the winter omicron wave. Still. health authorities urge vaccination even in people who ve previously had COVID-19. to strengthen their protection.Vaccination may not always prevent milder infections. especially as omicron and its siblings are better than some prior variants at slipping past those defenses. But health authorities agree the vaccinations continue to offer strong protection against the worst outcomes of COVID-19. including hospitalization and death.,Health News
I sat in stunned silence staring at the ER doctor trying to process what she had just said. I was in an auto accident ― a distracted driver ran a red light on a clear. sunny day at 12:15 in the afternoon. I went to the emergency room with minor injuries seeking reassurance they weren t major injuries. I had a CT scan. a couple of X-rays. and I peed in a cup. The doctor had just disclosed the results to me: concussion. contusions. cuts. oh. and I m pregnant.There must be some mistake. She looked at me like she was waiting for me to say something. and I looked at her like one of us doesn t know how menopause works. and it better not be me. (Spoiler alert: It was me.)  But I m five years menopausal.  I managed to stammer.  Do you still have all your organs?  she asked.doShe told me to follow up with a blood test at my regular doctor because it s more accurate. Panic set in. I did what any Floridian would do in an emergency: I went straight to Publix. I bought a twin pack of pregnancy tests and went home. Both of them were negative. It must have been cross-contamination. I told myself. But I go for the blood test anyway. This is no time to be sloppy.The following day at my doctor s office. she agreed that she can trace my menopause back seven years. and yes. I m still  pregnant  via urine test. (Dammit!)absolutelyA monthneednowAfter a few days of making frantic phone calls. it became apparent that the only way I was going to get any answers was to go back to the ER ― they could order a test and return same-day results. This time I was told there was no detectable pregnancy and that I should have a follow-up appointment for ovarian cancer. Amazingly. the doctor was still not 100% willing to state I m not pregnant ― he gave it a 99.8%. Even as he was discussing the levels of hormones they detected. I know for a fact that I m not. They would be detecting a pregnancy that is just hours or days old. so unless I was drugged and raped. it s something else ― most likely ovarian cancer. (I m still waiting for a final batch of tests that will confirm my diagnosis.)A wave of relief washed over me. The weight of the stress and anxiety I d been carrying around suddenly lifted from my shoulders. A faint chorus of angels sang only to me. Yes. cancer was a relief over pregnancy. horrificspending the next 18 years and at least $250.000 to raise him/her/them2. Mentally scarring myself and the kids I do have by putting it up for adoption (sorry ― we can t keep your sister).3. Termination (if that s even an option ― who knows how pregnant I could be).Instead. I have one easy path forward: aggressively treat the cancer. Furthermore. I don t have to disclose my sex life to anyone. explain how I  let this happen.  or deal with any social stigma for being a single. unwed mother. I don t have to replace my clothes. lose control of my body. or wear my diagnosis for everyone to see. comment on. and rub. Pregnancy is public. Cancer is private ― no one will know unless I tell them.With cancer. disease or dysfunction. there is no government intervention or regulation restricting care. Nor can the pharmacist embarrass me by refusing to fill my medication for religious reasons. No one claims cancer cells have a right to thrive. I don t know what the cancer treatment will entail. but I do know that with every previous pregnancy. the morning sickness was debilitating. I threw up 15 hours a day. for weeks straight. I would lie on the cold tile of the bathroom floor for proximity to the toilet and the cooling relief from the heat of my face. clutching an ultrasound photo of my twins. trying to convince myself it was going to be worth this hell to produce two healthy babies. Pregnancy isn t easy. even if we somehow manage to make it look effortless. Don t get me wrong: I know that my cancer might be fatal. But so might a pregnancy ― especially if Roe v. Wade is overturned. I almost died in my last one: It was heterotopic. As I type this. some states are trying to make surviving that illegal. The U.S. already has the highest maternal mortality rate of the developed world and that was when we had access to complete health care. I talk to my twins about that. They would have lost me (and their little brother) at age 11 if it was illegal to remove the wayward fetus stuck to my fallopian tube.  Right to life  somehow doesn t include the mom s life anymore (or any other fetuses in a multi-gestational pregnancy).As women and people with uteruses. we must now consider whether our partner s orgasm is worth our lives. With Roe gone. there would be no distinction between consenting to sex and consenting to conception. There is no longer any room for error. When and where our partner orgasms is the only controllable part of the equation ― and the control is not ours. Nor can we control ovulation. conception. implantation. gestation or birth ― the only part of the biological process we have any say over is sex. And sometimes. through force or coercion. we don t even get a say in that. Yet we are held completely accountable for whatever may come from the act. It is our lives that will be forever changed. Men might have to pay child support. Rapists might go to jail. The baby is always our burden.The message the government is sending is that it doesn t matter what you do or where you are in life: As a woman. there is no greater contribution to society than your ability to reproduce. You could be a scientist working on treating or curing COVID. a Supreme Court justice (looking at you. Amy Coney Barrett). a student. a cancer patient. a woman being beaten within inches of her life on a weekly basis. a trans person mid-transition ― it doesn t matter: You are expected to birth a child whether you can or not. whether you should or not. whether you want to or not. and whether you consented to or not. At what point did women cease to be autonomous people promised life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness and start to become assets of the government tasked to reproduce? I m afraid to have sex now. I know that I have had difficult pregnancies. I know that I might not be allowed to survive the same pregnancy as my last one if Roe is overturned. And now I know that I can get pregnant even through menopause and back-up birth control. and if I do. I won t have any idea until the vomiting starts. By then it will be too late. It s the stuff of nightmares. Cancer might be fatal. but during my heterotopic pregnancy it only took four weeks after conception (six weeks of a pregnancy!) for my fallopian tube to rupture. causing internal bleeding so badly that doctors couldn t see my organs because of all the blood spilling into my abdomen. If Roe is overturned and some trigger laws go into effect. some women will find themselves with a four-week expectation of life. I have twins graduating college in December and I really want to be here for that. How could I possibly engage in behavior that might kill me before I see that milestone?As sick as it may be. yes. when compared to pregnancy. the possibility of having ovarian cancer is a relief.Monica Fox has an MBA from the University of Florida and has spent 17 years in nonprofit management.

North KoreaThe North s emergency anti-virus headquarters said more than 1.2 million people fell ill amid a rapid spread of fever since late April and about 564.860 are currently under quarantine. The eight new deaths reported in the 24 hours through 6 p.m. Sunday brought its death toll to 50.State media didn t specify how many of the fever cases and deaths were confirmed as COVID-19 cases. Experts say North Korea likely lacks testing supplies and equipment to confirm coronavirus infections in large numbers and is mostly relying on isolating people with symptoms at shelters.Experts say the failure to slow the virus could have dire consequences for North Korea. considering its poor health care system. Its population of 26 million people are believed to be mostly unvaccinated after their government had shunned millions of shots offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program. likely over concerns related to international monitoring requirements.North Korea acknowledged its first COVID-19 outbreak last Thursday when it announced that an unspecified number of people in Pyongyang tested positive for the omicron outbreak. It had previously held for more than two years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world.Kim during a ruling party Politburo meeting on Sunday criticized government and health officials over what he portrayed as a botched pandemic response. saying state medicine supplies aren t being supplied to pharmacies in time because of their  irresponsible work attitude  and lack of organization. the North s official Korean Central News Agency said.The Politburo had issued an emergency order to immediately release and quickly distribute state medicine reserves and for pharmacies to switch over to 24-hour shifts. but Kim said such steps weren t being properly implemented. Kim ordered that the medical units of his military to get involved in stabilizing the supply of medicine in Pyongyang. KCNA said.State media had previously said a workforce of more than 1.3 million – including public health officials. teachers and medical university students – were mobilized to find people with fevers or other symptoms so that they could be quarantined.North Korea s claim of a perfect record in keeping out the virus for 2 1/2 years was widely doubted. But its extremely strict border closure. large-scale quarantines and propaganda that stressed anti-virus controls as a matter of  national existence  may have staved off a huge outbreak until now.While North Korea could suffer huge fatalities if it doesn t quickly receive international shipments of medical supplies. it s not immediately clear whether the North s admission of the outbreak communicates a willingness to receive outside help.Rival South Korea has offered to send vaccines and other supplies. but Seoul officials say the North has not made such a request. But some experts say Kim s comments last week during another Politburo meeting. where he praised China s pandemic response and urged his officials to learn from it. suggest that the North could be more willing to accept help from its major ally.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last week that Beijing was ready to offer North Korea help but said he had no information about any such request being made.Even as he called for stronger preventive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. Kim has also stressed that the country s economic goals should be met. which likely means huge groups will continue to gather at agricultural. industrial and construction sites.While accelerating his missile tests in a brinkmanship aimed at pressuring the United States for economic and security concessions. Kim has been grappling with domestic challenges at home as pandemic-related difficulties unleashed further shock on an economy broken by decades of mismanagement and crippling U.S.-led sanctions against the North. pushing him to perhaps the toughest moment since he took power in 2011.,Health News

Margaret AtwoodThe Handmaid s Tale too far-fetched. Theocratic dictatorships do not lie only in the distant pastIn Atwood s novel. women in America are used as reproductive slaves. strictly governed by a theocratic dictatorship directed by men. Atwood s model was based on 17th century New England Puritan religious rules and jurisprudence — and imported to the U.S.Samuel AlitoRoe v. Wadeopposed abortions — and executed  witches. The leaked opinion (which hasn t been finalized) would  overthrow settled law of 50 years on the grounds that abortion is not mentioned ... . True enough.  Atwood conceded.  The Constitution has nothing to say about women s reproductive health. But the original document does not mention women at all. Women  were deliberately excluded from the franchise.  she added. referring to the fledgling nation. Only men would no longer be taxed  without representation  or be ruled without  consent.  Women were barred from voting until 1920. Women were nonpersons in U.S. law for a lot longer than they have been persons.  Atwood chillingly noted.  If we start overthrowing settled law using Justice Samuel Alito s justifications. why not repeal votes for women? religions. for example. believe life begins at birthpregnant woman s life is the existing lifeNow. in Alito s opinion.  That which is a sin within a certain set of religious beliefs is to be made a crime for all.  Atwood wrote. Yet the Constitution demands that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  If a religion allows abortion. how can a different religion restrict it for those with different beliefs? It ought to be simple: If you believe in ‘ensoulment  at conception. you should not get an abortion. because to do so is a sin within your religion. If you do not so believe. you should not — under the Constitution — be bound by the religious beliefs of others.  Atwood argued. The Alito opinion  looks to be well on the way to establishing a state religion.  Atwood added. and is turning back to the 17th century. when Colonial women were burned at the stake based on religious evidence. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century. you should take a close look at that century.  Atwood warned.  Is that when you want to live?

Tanika Gray Valbrun I was that girl who always had to carry pads with her. felt like I was always on my period. had to wear two panties and biker shorts. always had an extra bag with me.  she told HuffPost. In addition to the heavy bleeding. Valbrun also experienced painful periods. her abdomen protruded and she felt a constant need to use the bathroom.It wasn t until she was about 25 that she received a diagnosis: uterine fibroids. Many doctors appointments and treatments followed. and though she is still on this medical journey. the source of her issues is no longer a mystery. Although fibroids are quite common. they remain relatively unknown or misunderstood for many.  Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow from smooth muscle cells. so they re often found in the uterus.  said Dr. Sawsan As-Sanie. an associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School.  They can be in the lining of the uterus. the wall of the uterus or on the surface.  Also called leiomyomas or myomas. fibroids vary in shape. size and number. Some grow slowly over many years while others might remain the same size for a long time and then start to grow rapidly. Looking back. I think about how many times I had accommodated my life for fibroids.  Valbrun said.  I was always strategizing what to bring or how to dress because I would be bleeding. I never wore white clothing. even though I love whites and light colors. Below. experts break down the facts and misconceptions around uterine fibroids.  Fibroids are highly prevalent. and they become more common as patients get older.  As-Sanie noted.will develop fibroids by the age of 50 Really. anyone with a uterus can experience uterine fibroids. but they disproportionately impact Black women at a higher rate.  Valbrun said.  Black women are more likely to experience them. and their fibroids are more likely to occur when they re younger. grow more quickly and cause more symptoms. Age is a big risk factor with fibroids. as their prevalence increases as patients grow older and then declines in post-menopausal women. Although fibroids are most common in women ages 30 to 40 and in Black women. As-Sanie said that she sees them in patients of all ages. races and ethnicities.  Mine started in my teenage years. so it s not just an issue for women in their childbearing years.  Valbrun added.  And even though race is a risk factor. it s not just a Black woman s disease ― just like endometriosis is not just a white woman s thing. There are genetic factors as well. A family history of fibroids is associated with a three times greater risk of developing fibroids compared with women without that history. As-Sanie explained. She noted that obesity and nulliparous (the medical term for having never given birth) can also be factors. Despite their prevalence. fibroids don t cause symptoms in the majority of people who have them.  Only about a quarter of women who have uterine fibroids have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they end up needing intervention.  As-Sanie said.The most common symptoms are related to menstruation. such as heavy bleeding and pelvic pain. Any amount of bleeding that interferes with quality of life deserves an evaluation.  As-Sanie noted.  We tell patients if they re soaking through a pad or tampon more frequently than every one to two hours. that should warrant evaluation. That amount can lead to anemia. low blood counts. Valbrun said that she s had to have at least five blood transfusions over the years to address her severe anemia. picaIn addition to menstrual pain. fibroids can also cause pain during sex and at random times. As Valbrun reported. they may lead to swelling in the uterus and abdomen as well.  Patients can also have what we call ‘bulk symptoms  ― pressure from fibroids if they get large enough. feelings of bloating. urinary frequency and urgency. and even constipation or other bowel issues.  As-Sanie said.  Fibroids are also associated with pregnancy-related complications like miscarriage and infertility.   In terms of diagnosis. fibroids are generally diagnosed or at least suspected during a pelvic exam.  As-Sanie said. noting that the uterus often feels enlarged.If fibroids are suspected. then the next step usually involves imaging. commonly with a pelvic ultrasound ― though tests including sonohysterography. hysteroscopy. hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy can also offer information.  Some patients come in reporting symptoms. but for others it might be diagnosed during a routine exam.  As-Sanie noted.  They may have had no clinical symptoms. Or if they re having trouble becoming pregnant. fibroids may be discovered as they look into their fertility problems. If you re diagnosed with uterine fibroids. the next steps depend on your symptoms. You might not need treatment if your fibroids are small and aren t causing symptoms or if you re nearing menopause.  If someone s not having symptoms. we typically just survey them over time.  As-Sanie said.  They should get regular checkups to monitor for development of symptoms if they re not having them. Often we ll get repeat imaging every year or couple years to monitor for fibroid growth. For patients with symptoms. it s important to examine the symptoms they re having and what their goals are.  With heavy bleeding. this can often be managed with medications ― like hormonal birth control pills. progestin-only birth control methods. other pills and injections.  As-Sanie said.Although those methods are effective for many patients. they don t work for others. And over time other interventions might become necessary. Myomectomy is the surgical removal of fibroids. and uterine artery embolization (sometimes called uterine fibroid embolization) is a less-invasive procedure that involves injecting tiny particles into the blood vessels to stop blood flow to the fibroids and cause them to shrink.  There are also different types of ablations where you can use forms of energy to basically burn them away or make them smaller.  Valbrun said. She added that the recovery process after fibroid-related procedures can be lengthy. noting that it took her about eight weeks to recovery from her myomectomy.Some fibroids are too small to be removed. and even after you ve had fibroids removed or shrunk. there s always a possibility of regrowth or new ones appearing. And some patients have so many fibroids that it wouldn t be feasible to remove all of them. As a result. the only total cure is hysterectomy. The choice of what treatment is appropriate in patients very much depends on both a combination of things. like their age and desire to preserve fertility. as well as fibroid size and location.  As-Sanie said.  Hysterectomy is generally considered a last resort when other things haven t worked. but it is considered curative and it s quite common in the U.S. And uterine fibroids and abnormal bleeding are the most common non-cancerous reasons that women have hysterectomies.  Any symptoms of heavy bleeding and/or pelvic pain that are bothersome enough that they re interfering with your quality of life warrant evaluation.  As-Sanie said.  There s no amount of bleeding or pain we would say is automatically ‘normal.  If you re not able to work as effectively or enjoy your life. that is by definition considered abnormal and deserves evaluation. Fibroids are relatively common. but they re also just one of many potential causes for increased levels of pain and bleeding. It s important to see a medical professional to help figure out what might be at the root of your problems and determine the best course of treatment.Many experience pregnancy complications or infertility related to fibroids. but medical interventions can help. So if you re hoping to give birth someday. know that fibroids don t necessarily prevent that.  For many women who have fibroids but no symptoms. we don t automatically recommend treatment in order to get pregnant or have a successful or healthy pregnancy.  As-Sanie said.  The relationship between fibroids and fertility and pregnancy is complicated. but there are many women who have fibroids ― even fibroids that cause symptoms ― that can become pregnant and carry a healthy pregnancy without needing intervention. And remember that there s nothing shameful about fibroids or any other gynecological issue.  Patients often feel like it s embarrassing. and their families ― or even physicians they ve seen ― have dismissed or minimized their pain as being a normal part of a woman s experience.  As-Sanie said.  This is unfair and unhelpful to women. She urged patients and medical providers to help break down the stigma around menstrual disorders. We need to improve awareness and diagnosis. as well as reduce the bias and stigma by talking about pain and bleeding so that young girls and women don t dismiss it as normal or think it s too shameful to talk about.  As-Sanie emphasized.  That way they can get earlier diagnoses and treatments. The White Dress Project I want to make people feel like they are not alone.  she said.  And I wanted the support for myself because I never saw any organized walks or runs or people asking me to buy a T-shirt about fibroid awareness. It feels very lonely to feel like you re the only one on the bathroom floor in the fetal position. You re the only one canceling on your girlfriends. the only one not spending the night at a guy s house even though you want to. advocates for policyMichigan state Rep. Kyra Harris Bolden (D) has also gotten involved in advocacy after being diagnosed with fibroids in 2020 and undergoing a myomectomy. It took me seven weeks to get back to what I felt was 100%. but ever since then. I ve been on this quest to just bring more awareness to fibroids.  she told HuffPost.  After I shared my story on the House floor during Uterine Fibroid Awareness Month. I got an outpouring of messages from women sharing their fibroid experience and how horrific it had been. Bolden has also partnered with organizations to spread awareness. worked on legislation and even helped get funding allocated for fibroid research in the Michigan state budget.  This condition affects so many women but isn t widely talked about.  she said.  If I had known it was so common. I probably wouldn t have waited until my condition got so bad to seek treatment and could ve had a less invasive surgery. Valbrun also wants to spread the word about the different treatment options for fibroids. A lot of times. hysterectomy is the only option offered for women to deal with fibroids.  she said.  Black women are more likely to be offered hysterectomy. I was told to have a hysterectomy when I was 26 and use a surrogate if I wanted children. and it was really disheartening. Fortunately. I found another doctor who told me about my other options. Of course. many patients are great candidates for a hysterectomy. especially if they are done having children or don t want to give birth. but Valbrun wants to make sure people feel informed and empowered about this decision rather than pressured.  Remember that you are powerful and have a say.  she said.  Nobody knows your body like you do. ,Health News
Chew on this: What if you could experience oral sex without actually taking off your clothes?according to BuzzFeed Newsmanufacturer has shownThe product is a brand of thin and stretchy single-use latex panties called LoralsThe panties are not cleared for fellatio or penetrative sex. however.Company officials had to prove the oral sex undies were at least equivalent to the protection provided by dental dams. a polyurethane barrier method that Los Angeles-area OB-GYN Dr. Sheryl Ross speculates is used by 5% of people at most.

Joe Bidenambitious pledge to donate 1.2 billion vaccine dosesin what he has called critically needed aid fundingThe White House said Biden will address the opening of the virtual summit Thursday morning with prerecorded remarks and will make the case that addressing COVID-19  must remain an international priority.  The U.S. is co-hosting the summit along with Germany. Indonesia. Senegal and Belize.The U.S. has shipped nearly 540 million vaccine doses to more than 110 countries and territories. according to the State Department — by far more than any other donor nation.After the delivery of more than 1 billion vaccines to the developing world. the problem is no longer that there aren t enough shots. but a lack of logistical support to get doses into arms. According to government data. more than 680 million donated vaccine doses have been left unused in developing countries because they were set to expire soon and couldn t be administered quickly enough. As of March. 32 poorer countries had used fewer than half of the COVID-19 vaccines they were sent.U.S. assistance to promote and facilitate vaccinations overseas dried up earlier this year. and Biden has requested about $5 billion for the effort through the rest of the year. disinformation.vaccinators We re going to continue to fight for more funding here.  Psaki said.  But we will continue to press other countries to do more to help the world make progress as well. Congress has balked at the price tag for COVID-19 relief and has thus far refused to take up the package because of political opposition to the impending end of pandemic-era migration restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even after a consensus for virus funding briefly emerged in March. lawmakers decided to strip out the global aid funding and solely focus the assistance on shoring up U.S. supplies of vaccine booster shots and therapeutics.Biden has warned that without Congress acting. the U.S. could lose out on access to the next generation of vaccines and treatments. and that the nation won t have enough supply of booster doses or the antiviral drug Paxlovid for later this year. He s also sounding the alarm that more variants will spring up if the U.S. and the world don t do more to contain the virus globally. To beat the pandemic here. we need to beat it everywhere.  Biden said last September during the first global summit.Centers for Disease Control and PreventionWorld Health OrganizationDemand for COVID-19 vaccines has dropped in some countries as infections and deaths have declined globally in recent months. particularly as the omicron variant has proved to be less severe than earlier versions of the disease. For the first time since it was created. the U.N.-backed COVAX effort has  enough supply to enable countries to meet their national vaccination targets.  according to vaccines alliance Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley. which fronts COVAX.Still. despite more than 65% of the world s population receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. fewer than 16% of people in poor countries have been immunized. It is highly unlikely countries will hit the World Health Organization target of vaccinating 70% of all people by June.In countries including Cameroon. Uganda and the Ivory Coast. officials have struggled to get enough refrigerators to transport vaccines. send enough syringes for mass campaigns and get enough health workers to inject the shots. Experts also point out that more than half of the health workers needed to administer the vaccines in poorer countries are either underpaid or not paid at all.Donating more vaccines. critics say. would miss the point entirely. It s like donating a bunch of fire trucks to countries that are on fire. but they have no water.  said Ritu Sharma. a vice president at the charity CARE. which has helped immunize people in more than 30 countries. including India. South Sudan and Bangladesh. We can t be giving countries all these vaccines but no way to use them.  she said. adding that the same infrastructure that got the shots administered in the U.S. is now needed elsewhere.  We had to tackle this problem in the U.S.. so why are we not now using that knowledge to get vaccines into the people who need them most? Sharma said greater investment was needed to counter vaccine hesitancy in developing countries where there are entrenched beliefs about the potential dangers of Western-made medicines. Leaders must agree to pursue a coherent strategy to end the pandemic instead of a fragmented approach that will extend the lifespan of this crisis.  said Gayle Smith. CEO of The ONE Campaign.GAVI s Berkley also said that countries are increasingly asking for the pricier messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. which are not as easily available as the AstraZeneca vaccine. which made up the bulk of COVAX s supply last year.The emergence of variants like delta and omicron have led many countries to switch to mRNA vaccines. which seem to provide more protection and are in greater demand globally than traditionally made vaccines like AstraZeneca. Novavax or those made by China and Russia.___Cheng reported from London.,Health News
SEOUL. South Korea (AP) — North Korea imposed a nationwide lockdown Thursday to control its first acknowledged COVID-19 outbreak after holding for more than two years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world.The outbreak forced leader Kim Jong Un to wear a mask in public. likely for the first time since the start of the pandemic. but the scale of transmissions inside North Korea wasn t immediately known. A failure to slow infections could have serious consequences because the country has a poor health care system and its 26 million people are believed to be mostly unvaccinated. Some experts say North Korea. by its rare admission of an outbreak. may be seeking outside aid.The official Korean Central News Agency said tests of samples collected Sunday from an unspecified number of people with fevers in the capital. Pyongyang. confirmed they were infected with the omicron variant.In response. Kim called at a ruling party Politburo meeting for a thorough lockdown of cities and counties and said workplaces should be isolated by units to block the virus from spreading. He urged health workers to step up disinfection efforts at workplaces and homes and mobilize reserve medical supplies.Kim said it was crucial to control transmissions and eliminate the infection source as fast as possible. while also easing inconveniences to the public caused by the virus controls. He insisted the country will overcome the outbreak because its government and people are  united as one. Despite the elevated virus response. Kim ordered officials to push ahead with scheduled construction. agricultural development and other state projects while bolstering the country s defense posture to avoid any security vacuum.North Korea s state TV showed Kim and other senior officials wearing masks as they entered a meeting room. although Kim removed his mask to speak into a set of microphones. Still photos distributed by KNCA showed Kim unmasked and sitting at the head of a table where all other officials remained masked.South Korea s Unification Ministry. which handles inter-Korean affairs. couldn t immediately confirm whether it was the first time state media showed Kim wearing a mask since the start of the pandemic. Kim has previously spoken to huge crowds without a mask as he praised the country s earlier pandemic response. and his decision to be seen with a mask could be aimed at raising public vigilance.North Korea. which has maintained strict anti-virus controls at its borders for more than two years. didn t provide further details about its new lockdown. But an Associated Press photographer on the South Korean side of the border saw dozens of people working in fields or walking on footpaths at a North Korean border town — an indication the lockdown doesn t require people to stay home. or it exempts farm work.The measures described in state media and Kim s declaration that economic goals should still be met could indicate that North Korea is focusing more on restricting travel and supplies between regions. analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea s Sejong Institute said.North Korea s government has shunned vaccines offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program. possibly because they have international monitoring requirements.Seoul s Unification Ministry said South Korea is willing to provide medical assistance and other help to North Korea based on humanitarian considerations. Relations between the Koreas have deteriorated since 2019 amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations and the North s increasingly provocative weapons tests.In Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing is offering North Korea help in dealing with the outbreak. North Korea has reportedly rejected previous Chinese offers of domestically developed vaccines.Kim Sin-gon. a professor at Seoul s Korea University College of Medicine. said North Korea is likely signaling its willingness to receive outside vaccines. but wants many more doses than offered by COVAX to inoculate its entire population multiple times. He said North Korea would also want COVID-19 medicines and medical equipment shipments that are banned by U.N. sanctions.Omicron spreads much more easily than earlier variants of the coronavirus. and its fatality and hospitalization rates are high among unvaccinated older people or those with existing health problems. That means the outbreak could cause  a serious situation  because North Korea lacks medical equipment and medicine to treat virus patients and many of its people are not well-nourished. Kim Sin-gon said.Ahn Kyung-su. head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG. a website focusing on health issues in North Korea. said North Korea s admission of the outbreak is likely designed to press its people harder to guard against the virus as China. which shares a long. porous border with the North. has placed many of its cities under lockdown over virus concerns.China s  zero-COVID  For Pyongyang to publicly admit omicron cases. the public health situation must be serious.  Easley said.  This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul. But the Kim regime s domestic audience may be less interested in nuclear or missile tests when the urgent threat involves coronavirus rather than a foreign military. North Korea s previous coronavirus-free claim had been disputed by many foreign experts. But South Korean officials have said North Korea had likely avoided a huge outbreak. in part because it instituted strict virus controls almost from the start of the pandemic.Early in 2020 — before the coronavirus spread around the world — North Korea took severe steps to keep out the virus and described them as a matter of  national existence.  It all but halted cross-border traffic and trade for two years. and is even believed to have ordered troops to shoot on sight any trespassers who crossed its borders.The extreme border closures further shocked an economy already damaged by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program. pushing Kim to perhaps the toughest moment of his rule since he took power in 2011.AntarcticaTurkmenistanIn recent months. some Pacific island nations that kept the virus out by their geographic isolation have recorded outbreaks. Only tiny Tuvalu. with a population around 12.000. has escaped the virus so far. while a few other nations – Nauru. Micronesia and Marshall Islands – have stopped cases at their borders and avoided community outbreaks.North Korea s outbreak comes as China — its close ally and trading partner — battles its biggest outbreak of the pandemic.In January. North Korea tentatively reopened railroad freight traffic between its border town of Sinuiju and China s Dandong for the first time in two years. but China halted the trade last month due to an outbreak in Liaoning province. which borders North Korea.___Associated Press journalists Lee Jin-man in Paju.

CAMBRIDGE. Mass. (AP) — U.S. COVID-19 cases are up. leading a smattering of school districts. particularly in the Northeast. to bring back mask mandates and recommendations for the first time since the omicron winter surge ended and as the country approaches 1 million deaths in the pandemic.public s worriesMaine s largest school district. in Portland. said this week masks would return. with Superintendent Xavier Botana saying that was the  safest course at this time  amid rising cases. Bangor. Maine. schools also brought back a universal mask requirement.High schools in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and in Montclair. New Jersey. a commuter suburb of New York City. also announced a return to masking. albeit temporarily through this week. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. most of the counties in the country considered to have  high  levels of COVID-19 are in the Northeast.In parts of Massachusetts that have seen high levels of COVID-19 transmission. authorities are also recommending masks in schools.FacebookDiana Martinez and Owen Cornwall. who have a first-grader at Graham and Parks School in Cambridge. Massachusetts. have been following the recommendation to mask their daughter. We re very happy about it. It gives us a little peace of mind.  said Martinez. 42. a professor at Tufts University.  I think the parents generally trend toward wearing them and that gives us some comfort. It s the same case at our pre-school. There will be a couple of parents who don t mask their child. but we will be masking our child. Cornwall said there seems to be a general consensus in the school community in favor of playing it safe. We re sort of lucky in this neighborhood. that they share our concerns with health.  said Cornwall. 37. a visiting scholar at Tufts.Reported daily cases in the U.S. are averaging 79.000. up 50% over the past two weeks. according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That s a fraction of where daily case counts stood earlier this year. when they topped 800.000.However. current case counts are a vast undercount because of a major downturn in testing and the fact tests are being taken at home and not reported to health departments.An influential modeling group at the University of Washington in Seattle estimates that only 13% of cases are being reported to health authorities in the U.S. — which would mean an undercount of more than a half million new infections every day.response across the countryOutside of schools. however. officials have shown little interest in returning to mask mandates.Last month. Philadelphia abandoned its indoor mask mandate just days after becoming the first large American city to reimpose the requirement in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.1 million deathsHospital workers at Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange.

NEW YORK (AP) — More than 107.000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year. setting another tragic record in the nation s escalating overdose epidemic. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated Wednesday.The provisional 2021 total translates to roughly one U.S. overdose death every 5 minutes. It marked a 15% increase from the previous record. set the year before. The CDC reviews death certificates and then makes an estimate to account for delayed and incomplete reporting.Dr. Nora Volkow. director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. called the the latest numbers  truly staggering. opioid painkillersLast year. overdoses involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids surpassed 71.000. up 23% from the year before. There also was a 23% increase in deaths involving cocaine and a 34% increase in deaths involving meth and other stimulants.Overdose deaths are often attributed to more than one drug. Some people take multiple drugs and inexpensive fentanyl has been increasingly cut into other drugs. often without the buyers  knowledge. officials say. The net effect is that we have many more people. including those who use drugs occasionally and even adolescents. exposed to these potent substances that can cause someone to overdose even with a relatively small exposure.  Volkow said in a statement.Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem as lockdowns and other restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get.Overdose death trends are geographically uneven. Alaska saw a 75% increase in 2021 — the largest jump of any state. In Hawaii. overdose deaths fell by 2%.___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

leaked draft opinion to overturn Roe v. WadeI did not expect to find my voice that day. I did not plan to yell through a bullhorn details from my past that I d thought I would always keep private.There was a small brass band at the protest. Some people brought signs. Progressive Montana state legislators led the usual kinds of call and response:  When do we want reproductive freedom? Now!  I saw a woman dressed as a Handmaid. another as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I hung near the back of the semicircle of men. women and kids. listening to the speeches.Two women talked about needing abortions before Roe. They had each developed complications. and then had to contend with the potential of prosecution. They were made to feel shame and fear. One of them was so afraid to admit she d had an abortion that the emergency room doctors removed her appendix. A local organizer of our small city s Pride event urged us to get to work on the upcoming midterm elections now.Something felt like it was missing from these powerful narratives of trauma and enforced shame. narratives that are now reality in states like Texas — and that could be the future for all American women and people with uteruses.I don t remember walking to the front of the crowd.I found myself standing before a couple hundred people.  My name is Rebecca.  I hollered into the bullhorn. And words poured out of me.My story about abortion is a not a painful one. It lacks drama. I carry from it no scars. physical or emotional.I got pregnant when I was 20. I did not plan it. I was in college. involved in a semi-serious relationship with a man I loved. but who I knew deep in my gut would not be my future life partner. We went dancing in the Castro. drank too much. stayed up all night talking about poetry and postmodern philosophy. Neither one of us was ready for a child. or wanted one.We made a stupid mistake. We were 20 years old. and soaring after dancing to techno and swigging rum and Cokes. We were usually diligent about condoms. but as my high school sex ed teacher repeated every week for a semester.  once is all it takes. I didn t put it together until my period was unusually late. I went to the nearest pharmacy and bought a test. I headed straight to the bathroom in the back and peed on the stick and all over myself. I kept the stick flat and deliberately did not look at it until five minutes had passed. The instructions said to look carefully for even the faintest pink line. There was nothing faint about the obnoxiously pink line shining back at me.Fuck.I was angry at myself for being careless. I didn t want to deal with this. But not once did it cross my mind to have a baby. When I told my boyfriend that night. he paused. looked down at his hands and said the right thing:  I m here to support you. whatever you decide.  I told him I was calling the abortion clinic the next day. He held me close that night. We were melancholy to be in this position. but our hearts and minds were clear. We could barely make rent and eat enough calories. We each had at least a year of school ahead of us. just to get a bachelor s degree. We were both planning on grad school after that. We loved each other. but we never talked about the future — about what might come after the end of this lease. the end of this semester.I got an appointment at the local clinic for later that week. I asked my boyfriend to come with me. I wanted to hold his hand beforehand. and I needed a ride home.We did not have to walk through a gauntlet of anti-choice protesters. In the waiting room. I paid the fee. There were women of all ages perched on worn but comfortable couches and chairs. The women were Black. brown and white. Some had young children with them.The staff and nurses were kind and efficient. They called me in to explain what would happen. They did not have to deliver a state-mandated speech. warning me I might regret this abortion until I died. I did not to have to listen to lies about increased risks of breast cancer. or future problems conceiving. I was not forced to have a trans-vaginal ultrasound. No one talked about my  baby.  or sought the static staccato of a fetal heartbeat. The staff asked if I was sure this was what I wanted to do. I was. They went over the procedure: speculum. manual exam. the cannula being inserted. I would hear the rumble of the machine that would empty the contents of my uterus. I would feel pressure and pulling. but hopefully no pain greater than that of menstrual cramps. If it hurt. they said. I should tell them. They told me what could go wrong. ranging from risk of infection to bleeding. I signed the consent form.I went back alone when I was called. My boyfriend offered to join me. but this felt like mine to own. By the time the middle-aged doctor came in to introduce himself. I was already naked from the waist down. with a drape over me. He seemed kind. and re-explained what would happen. He guided my feet into the stirrups. The abortion began. One nurse held my hand. Another assisted the doctor. and told me what to expect next.  That all went smoothly.  the doctor said. He patted my shoulder. I dressed slowly. and made my way to the  recovery area. I joined other women in overstuffed recliners. We got hot water bottles to help with cramping. A different nurse checked my blood pressure a couple of times. I got a sheet listing normal symptoms and symptoms to be concerned about. They gave me a number to call if I needed anything. I had what seemed like a heavy period for a couple of days. with cramps slightly worse than my usual menstrual ones. I popped two ibuprofens.I was back in class the next day and back to work the day after that. I did not feel transformed. I did not feel sad. In fact. I was thrilled my breasts immediately went back to normal. thrilled to have my own body back. I had no dreams of babies crying. It felt like any other minor medical procedure.Fourteen years later. my husband and I welcomed our son into the world. (My former boyfriend. for his part. has two beautiful children with his wife.) By the time I was pregnant with my son. I was in a stable relationship. My husband and I could support our child — emotionally. financially. logistically. We were ready ― more than ready. We were overjoyed when he was born.What would have happened if I d been denied this routine care? What if doctors were forced to read scripts that filled me with doubts that weren t my own? What if the process of getting an abortion was traumatic in itself (trans-vaginal ultrasounds for no reason)? What if I d accidentally wandered into a  crisis pregnancy center  and been told a passel of lies? What if I d gotten talked out of the abortion? Or if these religious zealots had stirred up enough guilt that I went on to torment myself for years? What if I needed an abortion now — not 30 years ago — in Texas or Mississippi past the six-week cutoff?I didn t go into all these details when I talked to the crowd at the rally. I focused on what felt most important to me. Women and people with uteruses stand to lose the easy experience I had 30 years ago. I made a personal decision with a doctor. I emerged from a routine medical appointment unscathed. I finished college. launched my career and met the love of my life.One in four American women will have an abortion by the age of 45. They turn to this medical procedure for different reasons. They all deserve what I experienced — safe. routine medical care. They deserve to get on with their lives. This is what women are losing. or have lost already in too many states. even before Alito cavalierly told American women how easy it is to carry a child to term these days. Firehouses are apparently waiting to receive unwanted babies. What more do we need?We often hear the hard stories about why abortion is necessary. About women who discover late in their pregnancies that their babies are severely disabled and require late-term abortions. About women whose abortions happened before Roe. These are stories we all need to hear.But it s equally important for women like me to speak up. We did not agonize. we were not traumatized. We are women who chose for ourselves what was right for us in our lives. Other women might make a different choice. When I finished talking at the rally. I started shaking in that weird way when your nerves can t quite keep up with reality. I got hugs and thanks for telling my story.Abortion is a private decision. It is one that should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor. It is not a shameful decision. I had always assumed I d keep my abortion to myself. But now. I feel it s time to be clear about what all American women stand to lose. I refuse to feel shame. I am grateful. And I m terrified for the future. Rebecca Stanfel is a freelance writer.

COVID-1920 million people.authorized in DecemberWHY DO SOME PATIENTS SEEM TO RELAPSE?Doctors have started reporting rare cases of patients whose symptoms return several days after completing Paxlovid s five-day regimen of pills. That s prompted questions about whether those patients are still contagious and should receive a second course of Paxlovid.Last week. the Food and Drug Administration weighed in. It advised against a second round because there s little risk of severe disease or hospitalization among patients who relapse.reported Charness says Paxlovid remains a highly effective drug. but he wonders if it might be less potent against the current omicron variant. The $500 drug treatment was tested and OK d based on its performance against the delta version of the coronavirus. The ability to clear the virus after it s suppressed may be different from omicron to delta. especially for vaccinated people.  said Charness. who works for Boston s VA health system.FDA statedSome experts point to another possibility: The Paxlovid dose isn t strong enough to fully suppress the virus. Andy Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University worries that could spur mutations that are resistant to the drug. We should really make sure we re dosing Paxlovid appropriately because I would hate to lose it right now.  said Pekosz. a virologist.  This is one of the essential tools we have to help us turn the corner on the pandemic. HOW WELL DOES PAXLOVID WORK IN VACCINATED PEOPLE? tested Paxlovid 60% of Americans That s the population I care about in 2022 because that s who we re seeing ― vaccinated people with COVID ― so do they benefit?  asked Dr. David Boulware. a University of Minnesota researcher and physician.There s no clear answer yet for vaccinated Americans. who already have a hospitalization rate far below 1%.That may come from a large. ongoing Pfizer study that includes high-risk vaccinated people. No results have been published. the study is expected to wrap up in the fall.Pfizer said last year that initial results showed Paxlovid failed to meet the study s goals of significantly resolving symptoms and reducing hospitalizations. It recently stopped enrolling anyone who s received a vaccination or booster in the past year. a change Boulware says suggests those patients aren t benefitting.At a minimum. the preliminary data should be released to federal officials. Boulware said.  If the U.S. government is spending billions of dollars on this medicine. what s the obligation to release that data so that they can formulate a good policy? CAN PAXLOVID BE USED TO HELP PREVENT COVID-19 INFECTION?Pfizer recently reported that proactively giving Paxlovid to family members of people infected with COVID-19 didn t significantly reduce their chances of catching it. But that s not the end of the story. Pfizer is studying several other potential benefits of early use. including whether Paxlovid reduces the length and severity of COVID-19 among households. It s a high bar to protect against infection but I d love to see data on how Paxlovid did against severe disease because it may be more effective there.  said Pekosz.___@AP_FDAwriter___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

 I heard you flew here from Texas?  I say to my patient as I enter the room. I m so sorry you had to come this far.  We are in an abortion clinic in New York City. a long way from her home. As I sit down next to her. her eyes fill up with tears and she begins to tell me how she couldn t get an appointment in Texas. The demand is so high that they could only offer her an appointment three weeks out. she explained. and she knew by then it would be too late.The famous Supreme Court case legalizing abortion in 1973. made abortion legal up to  viability.  a nebulous concept that varies but is commonly defined as 24 weeks. In 2021. Texas enacted a new anti-abortion law (called  SB8 ) that made abortion illegal past about six weeks — a time when most people don t even realize they re pregnant. Although this law is still being fought in federal courts. it has remained in effect for over eight months. which has directly impacted pregnant people that need to exercise their rights in a timely fashion. Every week. I am seeing more people from Texas with the same barriers to care.The Supreme Court draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that was leaked earlier this week reveals that Roe v. Wade. and all subsequent cases reaffirming the right to abortion. will likely be overturned this summer. It s important to know that abortion is still legal in all 50 states. If you have an appointment. don t be afraid to go in and get the care you need. The leaked document is just a draft. and we can t be sure what the final decision will be. but we are bracing for the worst. Let s be clear. Pregnancy is a deeply personal decision that should be left to individuals and their families. The criminalization of abortion will cause scrutiny of all pregnant people. and puts all of our communities at risk. The anti-abortion movement is a modern phenomenon that is rooted in racism and does not have a basis in our legal or religious traditions. The real issues we need to tackle are improving prenatal health care. including abortion care. and reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities. But we are not going back to 1973. The threat to our communities comes from anti-abortion laws themselves. not abortion.Back in my office. my patient s ultrasound shows that she s nine weeks pregnant. She expected this after all the delays caused by coordinating travel across the country. She tells me that she is staying at a hotel a few blocks away and the empty hotel room will be good for her. She has a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old at home. and they can make it hard to study. Dad is watching the kids and her grad school finals are coming up. so after the procedure today she ll be able to focus on studying before her flight back tomorrow.Flying to New York City for abortion care may seem unreasonable — and for most people. this is inaccessible due to cost of taking time off work. finding child care. and paying for travel — but people who can fly to New York are able to access health care without the medically unnecessary array of laws aimed at limiting abortion access in many states. These types of laws are commonly referred to as TRAP laws (targeted regulation of abortion providers). For example. many states require people to look at the ultrasound and wait 24 hours or more for a second appointment that is not medically necessary and only further increases the cost to the patient. causing them to spend more time away from home. work and family. Some states mandate that doctors give pregnant people medically inaccurate information about abortion by reading scripts written by the state filled with fear-mongering lies that abortion causes breast cancer (it does not) or that it may impact future fertility (it does not). Is there any other medical care where the law requires that doctors knowingly lie to their patients? I am a family medicine doctor by training and I practice full-spectrum primary care in my clinic. with my patients ranging from tiny newborns to centennials. My practice has a focus on reproductive health. gender-affirming care and trauma-informed care. and most of my patients are reproductive-age people. In this position. I do cervical cancer screening and treatment. I place and remove long-acting contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs). I offer prenatal dating ultrasounds. ongoing prenatal care for desired pregnancies. and. yes. abortion care. When someone walks into my office pregnant. I am ready to support them with whatever choice they make — my patients don t have to be referred to an additional clinic in order to get the care they need for themselves and their families.Though this kind of medicine may seem intuitive. this type of integrated care is hard to find in the U.S. Two days a week I work at an abortion clinic. where I perform abortions for people who don t have access to a primary care clinic like mine. There will also always be people who need or prefer services at an abortion clinic. In this setting. I am meeting many patients for the first time. like the woman who came to see me from Texas. and I may never see them again. We play music. talk about their lives outside the office — their kids. the food they re planning to eat afterwards. or how they re going to spend their weekend. My team tries to make it a safe space where people can talk about their feelings and be supported. I often think about how fortunate I am to offer people this life-changing care that will alter their trajectory for the better.Science tells us it really is for the better when people are able to access the abortion care they want and need. After their abortions. most people express gratitude and relief. but a complex range of emotions are normal. The famousTurnaway Study looked at women who were  turned away  from wanted abortion care compared to those who were able to access the abortion care they needed. The study followed 8.000 women over five years and found that women who were able to get an abortion were better off on every metric examined — including mental health outcomes. poverty level. education and more. An astounding 99% of the women interviewed said they didn t regret their decision to have an abortion. Please note that I am using  women  here because that is how the study was designed. but we know that people of all genders need and get abortions. In places where I use  women.  please know that data is not always gender-inclusive.The landmark case of Roe v. Wade made this all possible. It was restricted by later cases. such as Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. which applied a standard that states couldn t impose an  undue burden  on people seeking abortion. This concept is not well defined. and many states have continue to use legal restrictions without medical basis to obstruct abortion access. Even though abortion has been technically legal in the United States for almost 50 years. it is extremely hard to access in many parts of the country. Long travel times and requirements for multiple appointments make it nearly impossible for many low-income and underserved communities to access abortion care. And then there s the cost.The Hyde Amendment. which was first added as a rider to the federal spending budget in 1980 and has been added annually since then. makes it illegal for federal funds to cover the cost of abortion. This means that people employed by the government. armed service members. Indigenous people who are insured through the Indian Health Service. AmeriCorps workers. everyone whose insurance is federal Medicaid. and D.C. residents. among others. are required to pay for abortion out of pocket. Many states have banned public insurance programs. such as Medicaid and Medicare. from funding abortion as well. This means that the people with the lowest income in our country. who are disproportionately Black. Indigenous. and people of color. are also asked to pay the full cost of this essential medical care. In some states it s even illegal for private insurance companies to offer coverage.After all. the United States is not a friendly place for pregnant people. infants. or children. The U.S. ranks approximately 57th in the world for maternal mortality according to the World Health Organization. This figure means that Americans die at a rate almost 10 times higher from childbirth complications than people in countries that have the lowest maternal mortality rates. Over 700 Americans died from childbirth in 2019 alone. Infant and early childhood deaths in the U.S. are not much better — we rank 47th. Those are stark numbers for a country that often claims to have the greatest health care on Earth. There s a lot of reasons for this. but one of the biggest causes is poor access to comprehensive prenatal care and abortion care. particularly in marginalized communities. Pregnancy is risky for the body. It often worsens preexisting medical conditions and causes new ones. It is typical for people to suffer from worsened symptoms of asthma. blood pressure. and blood sugar — all of which can be life-threatening. During pregnancy. patients cannot get medical treatment for cancer. certain rheumatologic conditions. and other severe and life-threatening medical problems because the treatments available would cause potential harm or even the death of a fetus. Sometimes the pregnancy itself can cause death. It s not a benign thing to ask someone to put their body through pregnancy. Even without medical concerns. all reasons for seeking abortion are valid and normal. Let s be clear: Adoption isn t an alternative to abortion. It s an alternative to parenting. It s also important to acknowledge that criminalizing abortion results in criminalizing pregnant people more broadly. There is no blood test for doctors to detect medication abortion pills in the body. and it is impossible to distinguish an abortion from miscarriage. Anyone who experiences pregnancy loss could be prosecuted if abortion is illegal. This isn t theorizing — this is something that is already happening. In 2020. Brittney Poolaw. an Indigenous woman in Oklahoma. was sentenced to four years in prison for seeking medical care when she started bleeding during her pregnancy. Approximately one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage. putting every family at risk of legal scrutiny. but particularly people from marginalized communities like Poolaw.People have also been criminalized for seeking medical care during pregnancy deemed inappropriate by lawmakers. even when directed by their doctor. In 2019. Lindsay Rigdell was charged with child neglect after testing positive for cannabis. She had severe nausea and vomiting during her pregnancy. called hyperemesis gravidarum. and was treated with medical cannabis by her doctor in Arizona. where it was legal. Severe hyperemesis can also cause miscarriage. so either option would have left her open to criminal prosecution. These cases have garnered a lot of media attention. but there are countless more. Justice Alito asserts in his draft opinion that the word  abortion  does not appear in the Constitution. and he s not wrong. Of course. at the time of its writing. the  people  were only land-owning white men. Since then. the law has expanded  people  to include women and Black and Indigenous people. among others. As the rest of us have gained the rights originally reserved for only land-owning white men. the right to bodily autonomy comes with our personhood. Let me give you an example. Overturning Roe v. Wade means that the government can mandate that someone use their body to support a developing fetus. This is completely inconsistent with the fact that no person is required to use their body to the benefit of someone else. If a newborn requires a life-saving blood transfusion. personal autonomy rights protect the person who just gave birth and they could not legally be compelled to donate the life-saving blood. So why would the government have the right to demand the use of their body for the previous nine months?It s telling that Justice Alito s opinion also states that there is no constitutional basis for Loving v. Virginia. the case that legalized interracial marriage. and Obergefell v. Hodges. the case that legalized same-sex marriage. In both of these cases. the rights asserted are for people who weren t considered  people  in the original writing of the Constitution. As these groups have gained legal status in the U.S.. however. there is no basis to argue that the rights already afforded to land-owning white men in the Constitution wouldn t apply to everyone who has since been included in our country. It s shocking to think the Supreme Court is asserting that these rights shouldn t exist for Americans in 2022.Although abortion is a politically charged issue in the U.S.. it s a lot less controversial to everyday Americans. According to the Pew Research Center. in March 2022. 61% of Americans believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. a number that has gradually increased over the last few decades. Only 37% of Americans. on the other hand. believe it should be illegal in all or most cases. Most issues in the U.S. are much more contentious.Another important fact is that abortion used to be much less controversial. Abortion restrictions don t begin to appear in the United States until the 1820s. and laws weren t widespread until the American Medical Association started opposing abortion in the 1860s (the organization s stance has since changed — the AMA now affirms that abortion is safe. essential health care). The opposition to abortion by doctors was largely driven by abortions being performed by midwives and women in the community. who doctors saw as a threat to their medical practice. That means that the legacy of abortion prohibition in this country only lasted for about 100 years. from the 1860s to 1973. The majority opinion for Roe v. Wade was written by Justice Harry Blackmun. a Republican.Even the widespread religious opposition to abortion in the U.S. is modern. Before Roe v. Wade. the Clergy Consultation Service for Abortion. made up of Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis. helped connect people to safe abortion in the 1960s. Most major Protestant churches continued to support abortion rights after Roe v. Wade as a matter of their strong belief in religious freedom. specifically from the Catholic Church. who opposed abortion. The Southern Baptist Convention. the largest protestant group in the U.S.. openly supported the court s decision in 1973 and for years after.Nothing about abortion prohibition is fundamental to the cultural norms or common law of the U.S. In reality. the anti-abortion movement is rooted in white supremacist values. and the legacy of trying to control reproduction of Black and Brown people. When anti-abortion sentiment rose in the U.S.. much of the concern focused on Black and Brown women having more children than white women. Though the anti-abortion movement has changed the way it frames this narrative. the patriarchal concept of purporting to know what s best for the pregnant person remains unchanged. The pregnant person is always the most qualified to make decisions about their own bodies. not the government. All birthing people should have the ability to control their reproductive lives. which includes access to safe pregnancy or abortion care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. the mortality rate for Black and Indigenous women is four to five times higher compared to their white counterparts. and maternal mortality in the U.S. is actually increasing. unlike most other countries. The same states trying to restrict abortion coincidentally also have the worst maternal and infant outcomes — and the worst racial disparities. Louisiana. a state rampant with abortion restrictions. has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country at three times the national average. with 59% of Black maternal deaths found to be  preventable  compared to only 9% of white maternal deaths. If anti-abortion activists want to be truly pro-family. I have some recommendations. Let s put resources toward funding pregnancy and postpartum care. Why don t we expand paid parental leave. something that has been shown to improve outcomes for children? We could fund child care costs and increase access to healthy food. We should require infertility treatment as part of insurance coverage. giving people from all socioeconomic backgrounds the tools to build their families — reproductive freedom means you have access to both. Let s focus our money and time on addressing the grotesque maternal health disparities found between Black and white communities.Finally. I want to dispel the idea that the fall ofould take us back to 1973. when self-managed abortion was often dangerous. Many of us conjure the image of a coat hanger when thinking about the repercussions of anti-abortion laws. Today. we have medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. which is a much safer alternative. Telemedicine clinics like Hey Jane are a great option for people who want a doctor-led medication abortion. People in hostile states are turning to the internet to self-manage with abortion pills by ordering them online and having them delivered. Websites like Plan C and Aid Access are resources for anyone looking to self-manage an abortion. If you have concerns or questions about a self-managed abortion. there are places to get confidential medical advice from clinicians — check out the M+A Hotline. What can we do now? My patient from Texas was able to pay for her own flight and hotel to access abortion care. this is rare. Many people turn to abortion funds for help. These are community organizations that attempt to cover the cost of the procedure. travel. and other expenses but rely on donations and just don t have enough money to help everyone in need. If you are looking for a place to start. to help people who need care. check out the National Network of Abortion Funds. Become a member. make a donation to the broad group of abortion funds or pick one that directly impacts your community — everything helps. If you need care. check out their resources and get connected to support. We can support legislative initiatives that would allow clinicians to provide telemedicine abortion care across state lines. from  blue  states into  red  states. All of us can make our voices heard: protest. post on social media. call your lawmakers. make noise! We know that one in four women in this country has had an abortion and everyone loves someone who has had an abortion. If it s safe for you. break the stigma and silence surrounding abortion care and tell your story. Together. we can change the narrative on pregnancy and abortion on this country — after all. we are already the majority. ,Health News
In April 2016.The procedure took just 17 minutes.Less than 12 hours later. the 39-year-old was dead of a massive internal injury ― doctors found three liters of blood in her abdomen.This week. Charles Johnson filed a civil rights lawsuit against the hospital. saying that he believes he has proof the staff treated his wife with less care because she was Black. There is a culture of racism that is rampant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  Johnson said at a press conference Wednesday.Johnson and his lawyers say they learned about a shocking disparity in the standard of care given to white women compared with women of color as part of his pending wrongful death lawsuit against the facility. because they were able to question experts and hospital employees under oath. The wrongful death case is expected to go to trial next week in the Los Angeles Superior Court. There s no doubt in my mind that my wife would be here today. and be here Sunday celebrating Mother s Day with her boys. if she was a caucasian woman.  Johnson said.  The reality is that on April 12. 2016. when we walked into Cedars-Sinai hospital for what we expected to be the happiest day of our lives. the greatest risk factor that Kira Dixon Johnson faced was racism.  According to the lawsuit. Kira Johnson was in good health before walking into Cedars-Sinai. She was also accomplished: Charles has said in past interviews that his wife spoke five languages. was a licensed pilot. a marathon runner and had gone skydiving solo.After her C-section. Kira felt intense pain in her abdomen and her family noticed blood in her catheter. so they alerted her doctor. who ordered a CT scan. But the scan never happened. Begging medical staff to tend to her produced no results for hours. At one point. Charles Johnson said Wednesday. a nurse told him.  Sir. your wife just isn t a priority right now. according to the American Society of Anesthesiologistsstudytwo to three times more likelyJohnson said that the civil rights suit was about  so much more than Kira.   It is about sending a loud. definitive message that institutions like Cedars-Sinai Medical Center can no longer prey on Black and brown families without consequence.  he said.,Health News
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials are looking into more than 100 possible cases of a mysterious and severe liver disease in children. including five deaths.About two dozen states reported suspected cases after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a call for doctors to be on the lookout for surprising cases of hepatitis. The cases date back to late October in children under 10. So far. only nine cases in Alabama have been confirmed. We are casting a wide net to broaden our understanding.  the CDC s Dr. Jay Butler said Friday.What s causing the illnesses isn t clear. Adenovirus was detected in half the children.  but we do not know if it is the cause.  he said.There are dozens of adenoviruses. many of them associated with coldlike symptoms. fever. sore throat and pink eye. But some versions can trigger other problems. including inflammation in the stomach and intestines. Officials are exploring a link to one particular version that s normally associated with gut inflammation.U.S. health officials haven t seen evidence of an unusually large wave of adenovirus infections. although many doctors don t usually test for it.This week. the World Health Organization officials said they had reports of almost 300 probable cases in 20 countries.In the U.S.. most of the children were toddlers. nearly all were hospitalized and eight received liver transplants It s still a very rare occurrence.  Butler said.  A majority of these cases have recovered and recovered fully. The mystery goes back to NovemberButler said none of the Alabama children were vaccinated against COVID-19. That has been ruled out as a possible cause.  and we hope this information helps clarify some of the speculation circulating online. Symptoms of hepatitis. or inflammation of the liver. include fever. fatigue. loss of appetite. nausea. vomiting. abdominal pain. dark urine. light-colored stools. joint pain and jaundice.In addition to Alabama. the states reporting suspected cases: California. Colorado. Delaware. Florida. Georgia. Idaho. Illinois. Indiana. Louisiana. Michigan. Minnesota. Missouri. North Carolina. North Dakota. Nebraska. New York. Ohio. Pennsylvania. Tennessee. Texas. Washington. Wisconsin.

Researchers trying to learn what killed the first person to receive a heart transplant from a pig have discovered the organ harbored an animal virus but cannot yet say if it played any role in the man s death.died in MarchBut a major worry about animal-to-human transplants is the risk that it could introduce new kinds of infections to people.Because some viruses are  latent.  meaning they lurk without causing disease.  it could be a hitchhiker.  Dr. Bartley Griffith. the surgeon who performed Bennett s transplant. told The Associated Press.Still. development is under way of more sophisticated tests to  make sure that we don t miss these kinds of viruses.  added Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin. scientific director of the university s xenotransplant program.The animal virus was first reported by MIT Technology Review. citing a scientific presentation Griffith gave to the American Society of Transplantation last month.For decades. doctors have tried using animal organs to save human lives without success. Bennett. who was dying and ineligible for a human heart transplant. underwent the last-ditch operation using a heart from a pig genetically modified to lower the risk that his immune system would rapidly reject such a foreign organ.The Maryland team said the donor pig was healthy. had passed testing required by the Food and Drug Administration to check for infections. and was raised in a facility designed to prevent animals from spreading infections. Revivicor. the company that provided the animal. declined to comment.Griffith said his patient. while very ill. had been recovering fairly well from the transplant when one morning he woke up worse. with symptoms similar to an infection. Doctors ran numerous tests to try to understand the cause. and gave Bennett a variety of antibiotics. antiviral medication and an immune-boosting treatment. But the pig heart became swollen. filled with fluid and eventually quit functioning. What was the virus doing. if anything. that might have caused the swelling in his heart?  Griffith asked.  Honestly we don t know. The reaction also didn t appear to be a typical organ rejection. he said. noting the investigation still is underway.Meanwhile doctors at other medical centers around the country have been experimenting with animal organs in donated human bodies and are anxious to attempt formal studies in living patients soon. It s not clear how the pig virus will affect those plans.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Wadepolice brutalityuse of chemical weaponsmass arrestsviolent clashes with counterprotestersThat doesn t mean the act of protesting is inherently unsafe. however. There are precautions people should take when they go out and demonstrate. Below. we share some expert-backed advice.  The First Amendment protects our right to make our voices heard. including by gathering together in public and protesting.  said Vera Eidelman. staff attorney with the ACLU Speech. Privacy and Technology Project.  The restrictions that government actors can place on public protest are limited. but the fact is that they don t always stick to the rules. It s a good idea to make sure you re prepared by brushing up on your rights before heading out into the streets.  Know Your Protest Rights  page You don t need a permit to protest in response to breaking news.  Eidelman said.  You also don t need a permit to march in the streets or along sidewalks. as long as you re not obstructing car or pedestrian traffic. or access to buildings. If you don t have a permit. police officers can order you to move to the side of the street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons. If you are lawfully present in a public space. you have the right to photograph anything in plain view. which includes federal buildings and any police present. If you believe your rights were violated during a protest. take a moment to get contact information from witnesses. photograph any injuries and write down all the details you can remember.Eidelman noted that the main job of the police during a protest should be to protect your right to protest and de-escalate any threat of violence.  If you get stopped by police. ask if you re free to go.  Eidelman advised.  If they say yes. calmly walk away. If you get arrested. you have a right to ask why. Otherwise. say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don t sign. say or agree to anything without a lawyer present. previously told HuffPostBefore you go to a demonstration. research the event to see if the organizers have issued any advice regarding things to wear and bring. and other expectations. Take time to look into the organizers of the protest as well. to ensure the movement aligns with your values and doesn t promote violence or any other issues that could harm your health and safety. Don t go to a protest alone. if possible. Try to buddy up with someone. meet up with an affinity group or at least let your loved ones know where you ll be in case something happens. And don t forget to make a sign with the message you d like to share in the protest.violent attacks from counter-protesterspolice brutalityAs you participate in a protest. be vigilant. Pay attention to the people around you and what they re doing. If someone is exhibiting distress or panic. try to calm them or help them find safety. Locate the nearest exits in case you or your peers need to quickly leave the demonstration. Take note of any cars with drivers nearby.Resist the temptation to engage with counter-protesters. who often shout and hold signs with inflammatory messages with the goal of creating conflict. Don t indulge them. Try to remain calm and focused. and pay attention to any instructions or requests from the protest leaders.pepper spraytear gaslearn what to do if you re exposed to an irritant like thisThe best way to deal with pepper spray or tear gas is to flush it out of your eyes with water and remove yourself from the area. Blink rapidly and resist the urge to touch or rub your eyes. surrounding skin into your eyesWe  run liters of water. potentially. into [a patient s] eyes until they are feeling better and we feel like the chemical is out.  Dr. Diane Calello. executive and medical director of the New Jersey Poison Center. previously told HuffPost.Although many people suggest using milk to rinse out your eyes. doctors don t typically recommend it.  Will it hurt to pour milk into your eyes instead of water? No. it won t. but it probably does not have any benefit over water or saline irrigation.  Calello said.In addition to cleaning your eyes. try to cough. spit and blow your nose to get as much of the chemical out of your body as possible. And if the burning and itching persists for several hours ― even after you ve showered. changed and otherwise decontaminated yourself — consider seeking medical attention. Coming into contact with tear gas or pepper spray can be painful and traumatic. so once you re finished washing it out and otherwise tending to your physical health. take some time for other forms of self-care as you process and recover from the experience. ,Health News

As we age we see changes in our skin. particularly around the eye area. Wrinkles and fine lines are an inevitable part of getting older. and have many contributing causes. Dr. Rhonda KleinDr. Joyce Park As we squint and emote throughout the years. these repeated actions cause lines to form.  Park explained.  Aging skin is also less able to hold onto moisture. and dry skin wrinkles more readily. Additionally. environmental exposures to UV radiation or smoke over time can cause wrinkling. These wrinkles and fine lines are completely natural. but they can be a source of insecurity for many ― even impacting everyday lives. Dr. Karan LalThe good news is you don t have to give up on smiling or laughing to address wrinkles around your eyes. Below. experts share their advice for preventing and treating these fine lines. Dr. Papri Sarkarretinoid creamLal also advises retinol and offered a product recommendation.RoC Retinol Correxion Line Smoothing Eye CreamDr. Hadley KingPond s Rejuveness Lifting and Brightening Eye Creamniacinamide  Rubbing the eye area can cause lines and pigmentation.  Sarkar said.  That s why I generally recommend handling this area very gently! Don t rub or pick your eyes or the skin around them. While it s overall best to avoid touching your eye area (or face in general). we learned from the pandemic that it s not always easy to do this. Plus. there are daily tasks that require us to come into contact with our eye areas. In these instances. the key is to be mindful.Dr. Deanne Mraz RobinsonRetinol gets a lot of attention in the skin care world these days. But when it comes to tackling fine lines. many experts also tout the benefits of peptides. Peptides are basically short chains of amino acids. which are the building blocks of proteins like collagen and elastin.The Ordinary s Argireline SolutionRevision s Revox Line RelaxerDEJ Eye CreamRevox 7 One of the only clinically proven topical products that helps smooth the appearance of expression lines. this serum contains seven different anti-aging peptides.  King said of Revox 7.  Their studies show that it softens the appearance of seven types of expression lines: forehead lines. glabella frown lines. crow s feet. bunny nose lines. nasolabial laugh lines. lip lines. marionette lines.  Sun exposure or UV radiation is another preventable cause of fine lines and wrinkling.  Sarkar said.  Making sure this area and the rest of your skin is protected is important. mineral sunscreen A large. wide-brimmed hat also helps to provide shade to the eye area and is sometimes easier to keep on than remembering to reapply sunscreen as often as you need it.  Sarkar added. Hats and sunglasses also help prevent squinting in the sun. which further exacerbates fine lines.  You can t really change your genes or stop the years from marching by. but you can make some important changes to prevent fine lines.  Sarkar said.  Smoking is bad for every organ system. including the skin. If you re smoking. take this as a signal that it s time to kick that habit to the curb. Art of Skin MD Appropriate sleep. rest. physical activity. stress management. and nutrition all play a role in the look of the area around our eyes and the overall health of our skin.  Palm said.Dr. Brian HiblerWhen choosing a product. talk to your dermatologist to determine the best options for your skin type.No7 Youthful Eye SerumOlay Total Effects Eye Transforming CreamMake sure you re staying hydrated as well. In addition to the other health benefits of drinking water. it s great for the skin. Although this is a temporary cause. dehydration or dry skin can also cause undereye lines to be more pronounced.  Sarkar noted. If the wrinkles have already formed. you can consider Botox in the crow s feet area to soften the lines.  Park suggested. Botox is a neuromodulator. which can relax the muscle activity in areas of the face and thus soften the lines created by muscle movement and reduce their appearance at rest. Other common neuromodulators include Dysport. Xeomin and Juveau. Younger people are increasingly turning to Botox treatments for so-called prejuvenation ― minimizing movement and treating wrinkles before they are fully formed to prevent deep creases.  It is normal to have expression around the eyes. but if we can relax the muscles so that the movement is not as strong or dynamic. we can reduce the appearance and onset of these lines and prevent them from becoming etched deeper into the skin. at which point they become more difficult to treat.  Hibler said. King recommended trying dermal fillers if Botox doesn t offer satisfactory results.  If the lines were etched in and do not sufficiently disappear after a neuromodulator. then a superficial filler like Belotero can create great results.  King said.  This may be approximately $700-1.500. Sarkar also suggested the filler route. with a couple of caveats.  Filler can be used to volumize the area to mimic the fat and bone loss this area goes through.  Sarkar said.  I recommend very small layers of filler. as this area has a propensity to swell. Undercorrection is definitely better than overcorrection here.  Laser resurfacing is the gold standard for static fine lines that are etched into the skin.  Lal said.  It is usually a one-time treatment that removes the skin layer by layer around the eyes and reverses time. Lal noted that the laser option isn t for everyone. as it requires one to two weeks of downtime and is associated with redness that can last for one to two months after the procedure. It s important to go to an expert. as there is potential for scarring as well.  Laser skin resurfacing can be very helpful in reducing crepiness.  King added.  This is a great way to stimulate collagen production and improve the skin texture.  King noted that a brand of laser treatment called Clear and Brilliant requires minimal downtime and costs about $400 to $500. while a more aggressive laser option called Fraxel requires more downtime and may cost as much as $5.000. depending on how much of the face is treated.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

coronavirusomicronseven-day rolling averageThe seven-day average for hospitalizations is also up by 20%. with the CDC reporting an average of 2.215 admissions over the last seven days ― up from the prior week s average of 1.845.Deaths from COVID-19This drop in fatalities is likely thanks in part to current dominant variants appearing to be less deadly and vaccination rates being high in the U.S.. Dr. Robert Garry. a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University. told HuffPost. As of this week. roughly 66% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated. according to the CDC. The preexisting immunity lets your body handle the infection better. but these variants are so infectious they may not keep you from getting infected.  he said.nearly 62% of casesThis increased transmissibility may be because BA.2.12.1 has not only the omicron BA.2 variant mutation but two more mutations. said Garry. One of these makes the virus replicate a bit better (S704L). The other (L452Q) makes it resist prior immunity.  he said of these two additional spike protein mutations. So BA.2.12.1 is more infectious. None of the omicron subvariants seem to induce more severe disease than the original omicron (BA.1). BA.1 seems less severe than delta. but. again. the role of preexisting immunity is hard to factor in.  he added. We have a very. very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America.  Dr. Ashish Jha. White House COVID-19 response coordinator. said last week following news of a positive coronavirus test for Vice President Kamala Harris. who is fully vaccinated and twice boosted.Health officials have cautioned that while these current subvariants may be less severe. they could lead to long-term health issues.told ABC s  This Week Elsewhere in the world. health officials are monitoring the spread of two less common subvariants of omicron: BA.4 and BA.5.capable of dodging It s too soon to know whether these new subvariants can cause more severe disease than other omicron subvariants. but early data suggest vaccination remains protective against severe disease and death.

LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization is estimating that nearly 15 million people were killed either by the coronavirus or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems in the past two years. more than double the official death toll of 6 million. Most of the fatalities were in Southeast Asia. Europe and the Americas.In a report released on Thursday. the U.N. agency s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the figure as  sobering.  saying it should prompt countries to invest more in their capacities to quell future health emergencies.Scientists tasked by WHO with calculating the actual number of COVID-19 deaths between January 2020 and the end of last year estimated there were between 13.3 million and 16.6 million deaths that were either caused directly by the coronavirus or were somehow attributed to the pandemic s impact on health systems. like people with cancer unable to seek treatment when hospitals were full of COVID patients.The figures are based on country-reported data and statistical modeling. WHO did not immediately break down the figures to distinguish between direct deaths from COVID-19 and others caused by the pandemic. This may seem like just a bean-counting exercise. but having these WHO numbers is so critical to understanding how we should combat future pandemics and continue to respond to this one.  said Albert Ko. an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Public Health who was not linked to the WHO research. For example. Ko said. South Korea s decision to invest heavily in public health after it suffered a severe outbreak of MERS allowed it to escape COVID-19 with a per-capita death rate around a 20th of that of the U.S.6 million Scientists at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington guessed there were more than 18 million COVID deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 in a recent study published in the journal Lancet. and a team led by Canadian researchers estimated there were more than 3 million uncounted coronavirus deaths in India alone.delta variantAfrica Dr. Bharat Pankhania. a public health specialist at Britain s University of Exeter. said we may never get close to the true toll of COVID-19. particularly in poor countries.cremated quicklyAlthough Pankhania said the currently estimated COVID-19 death toll still pales in comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic — when experts estimate up to 100 million people died — he said the fact that so many people died despite the advances of modern medicine. including vaccines. is shameful.He also warned the cost of COVID-19 could be far more damaging in the long term. given the increasing burden of long COVID. With the Spanish flu. there was the flu and then there were some (lung) illnesses people suffered. but that was it.  he said.  There was not an enduring immunological condition that we re seeing right now with COVID.  he said. We do not know the extent to which people with long COVID will have their lives cut short and if they will have repeated infections that will cause them even more problems.

A Canadian official said Wednesday that Americans will be able to obtain abortions in Canada should the Supreme Court overturn the landmark abortion rights decision. Roe v. Wade.told the Canadian Broadcasting CorporationAbortion is legal in Canada at any point in pregnancy. Although the country provides universal health care. access to different abortion services varies between provinces.A spokesperson for Gould later told the CBC that Americans seeking abortions in Canada would either have to pay for the service out-of-pocket or with their own private insurance. if they aren t covered by one of Canada s provincial health plans. Gould s comments came in the wake of the Supreme Court s leaked draft majority opinion that it plans to overturn Roe. paving the way for millions of women to lose access to reproductive rights.While it will be legal for American women to obtain abortions in Canada. there is still the issue of accessibility. Many people don t have the resources to travel interstate. let alone internationally. to obtain the procedure.Gould also noted that potential abortion bans in the U.S. could affect access for Canadian women. One of the concerning factors here is that there are many Canadian women who maybe don t live near a major city in Canada. but will often access these services in the United States.  she said.  I m very concerned about the leak yesterday. I m very concerned about what this means. particularly for American women. but also for Canadian women. In response to the leak. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the  right to choose is a woman s right and a woman s right alone. ″,Health News
leaked draftlose access to abortion98-page draftabortion Until the latter part of the 20th century. there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Zero. None. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down. no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Alito is right: Abortion was widely banned throughout the centuries of U.S. history when women were legally regarded as second-class citizens. kept out of medical institutions and public office and banned from owning property. They didn t gain the right to vote until 1920. and Black women faced barriers to voting until Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 ― just eight years before the court decided Roe. after the Roe decisionLegal progress on female bodily autonomy was made after women fought their way into the decision-making spaces men had long excluded them from. But here s what Alito had to say:  The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation s history and traditions.  he wrote.  On the contrary. an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973.  Most Americans have probably never heard of Sir Matthew Hale. an English jurist who was born in 1609. But Alito cites him a half-dozen times throughout his draft as proof that abortion bans are an indispensable part of our country s heritage.  Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman ‘with child  a ‘potion  to cause an abortion. and the woman died. it was ‘murder  because the potion was given ‘unlawfully to destroy her child within her.   Alito wrote in defense of outlawing abortion in 2022. reportersrecentlydug upThough Alito holds him up as the authority on the criminality of aborting a fetus. Hale also advocated for the death penalty for children as young as 14. medical standardswhere babies came fromAlito wrote throughout his draft that abortion should be a matter of state law. If people want access to it. he wrote. they simply need to elect people who support it.  Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legislative bodies. and it allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion. lobbying legislators. voting. and running for office.  he wrote in one passage.  Women are not without electoral or political power. State legislatureswill not actFurthermore. the will of the voters does not always determine the makeup of our country s highest political and legal bodies. Alito himself was nominated to the high court by a man who became president without winning the popular vote. So were three of the other four justices who apparently want to strike down Roe: Brett Kavanaugh. Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.The recent wave of abortion bans tied to the presence of  fetal heartbeats  is not based on real science. doctors have said for years. But Alito repeats the myths written those laws anyway. calling them  factual findings. The Mississippi legislature  found that at five or six weeks  gestational age an ‘unborn human beings heart begins beating.   Alito wrote in one passage.told HuffPost in 2019 At that point. it really is just these two tubes with a couple of layers of cardiac or heart cells that can vibrate or cause some sort of movement that we use colloquially to talk about a ‘fetal heartbeat.  Without offering any pushback. Alito summarizes a hollow argument by the anti-abortion movement: that being pregnant and being a mother aren t as difficult as they used to be.  Attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried women have changed drastically. that federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases. that the costs of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or government assistance.  Alito wrote. 29 paid weeksonly10 statesnearly $11.000vary wildlyAlito also harped on how much the decisions in Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey ― a 1992 Supreme Court decision that upheld the former ― have divided the country.  Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.  Alito wrote.  Its reasoning was exceptionally weak. and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue. Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division. largely stablerecent decades,Health News

BlackAnd if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions. minority women who already face limited access to health care will bear the brunt of it. according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press.the leak of a draft it sent shockwaves Overturning the Roe v. Wade ___EDITOR S NOTE — This is an updated version of a story released earlier this year.___Kaiser Family FoundationIn Texas. they re 59% of the population and 74% of those receiving abortions. The numbers in Alabama are 35% and 69%. In Louisiana. people of color represent 42% of the population. according to the state Health Department. and about 72% of those receiving abortions. Abortion restrictions are racist.  said Cathy Torres. an organizing manager with Frontera Fund. a Texas organization that helps women pay for abortions.  They directly impact people of color. Black. brown. Indigenous people ... people who are trying to make ends meet. Why the great disparities? Laurie Bertram Roberts. executive director of the Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund. which provides financial support for women seeking abortion. said women of color in states with restrictive abortion laws often have limited access to health care and a lack of choices for effective birth control. Schools often have ineffective or inadequate sex education.If abortions are outlawed. those same women — often poor — will likely have the hardest time traveling to distant parts of the country to terminate pregnancies or raising children they might struggle to afford. said Roberts. who is Black and once volunteered at Mississippi s only abortion clinic. We re talking about folks who are already marginalized.  Roberts said.Amanda Furdge. who is Black. was one of those women. She was a single. unemployed college student already raising one baby in 2014 when she found out she was pregnant with another. She said she didn t know how she could afford another child.She d had two abortions in Chicago. Getting access to an abortion provider there was no problem. Furdge said. But now she was in Mississippi. having moved home to escape an abusive relationship. Misled by advertising. she first went to a crisis pregnancy center that tried to talk her out of an abortion. By the time she found the abortion clinic. she was too far along to have the procedure.She s not surprised by the latest news on the Supreme Court s likely decision. Most people who aren t affected don t consider the stakes. People are going to have to vote.  said Furdge. 34. who is happily raising her now 7-year-old son but continues to advocate for women having the right to choose.  People are going to have to put the people in place to make the decisions that align with their values. When they don t. things like this happen. Torres said historically. anti-abortion laws have been crafted in ways that hurt low-income women. She pointed to the Hyde Amendment. a 1980 law that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in rare cases.She also cited the 2021 Texas law that bans abortion after around six weeks of pregnancy. Where she lives. near the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. women are forced to travel to obtain abortions and must pass in-state border patrol checkpoints where they have to disclose their citizenship status. she said.Regardless of what legislators say. Torres insisted. the intent is to target women of color. to control their bodies:  They know who these restrictions are going to affect. They know that. but they don t care. But Andy Gipson. a former member of the Mississippi Legislature who is now the state s agriculture and commerce commissioner. said race had nothing to do with passage of Mississippi s law against abortion after the 15th week. That law is the one now before the Supreme Court in a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.Gipson. a Baptist minister who is white. said he believes all people are created in the image of God and have an  innate value  that starts at conception. Mississippi legislators were trying to protect women and babies by putting limits on abortion. he said. I absolutely disagree with the concept that it s racist or about anything other than saving babies  lives.  said Gipson. a Republican.  It s about saving lives of the unborn and the lives and health of the mother. regardless of what color they are. To those who say that forcing women to have babies will subject them to hardships. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch. a white Republican. said it is  easier for working mothers to balance professional success and family life  than it was 49 years ago when Roe was decided.Fitch. who is divorced. often points to her own experience of working outside the home while raising three children. But Fitch grew up in an affluent family and has worked in the legal profession — both factors that can give working women the means and the flexibility to get help raising children.That s not the case for many minority women in Mississippi or elsewhere. Advocates say in many places where abortion services are being curtailed. there s little support for women who carry a baby to term.Mississippi is one of the poorest states. and people in low-wage jobs often don t receive health insurance. Women can enroll in Medicaid during pregnancy. but that coverage disappears soon after they give birth.infant mortality rateMarch of DimesU.S. Census Bureau informationProblems are compounded in states without effective education programs about reproduction. Mississippi law says sex education in public schools must emphasize abstinence to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Discussion of abortion is forbidden. and instructors may not demonstrate how to use condoms or other contraception.Planned ParenthoodShe said when she was attending public school in rural Mississippi. she didn t learn about birth control. Instead. a teacher stuck clear tape on students  arms. The girls were told to put it on another classmate s arm. and another. and watch how it lost the ability to form a bond. They d tell you. ‘If you have sex. this is who you are now: You re just like this piece of tape — all used up and washed up and nobody would want it.   Harden said.When she became pregnant at 21. she knew she wanted an abortion. Her mother was battling cancer and Harden was in her last semester of college without a job or a place to live after graduation.She said she was made to feel fear and shame. just as she had during sex ed classes. When she went to the clinic. she said protesters told her she was  ‘killing the most precious gift   from God and that she was  ‘killing a Black baby. playing into what white supremacists want.  Harden s experience is not uncommon. The anti-abortion movement has often portrayed the abortion fight in racial terms.Outside the only abortion clinic operating in Mississippi. protesters hand out brochures that refer to abortion as Black  genocide  and say the late Margaret Sanger. founder of Planned Parenthood and a proponent of eugenics.  desired to eradicate minorities.  The brochures compare Sanger to Adolf Hitler and proclaim:  Black lives did not matter to Margaret Sanger! denounces Alveda King. an evangelist Tanya Britton. a former president of Pro-Life Mississippi. often drives three hours from her home in the northern part of the state to pray outside the abortion clinic in Jackson. Britton is Black. and she said it s a tragedy that the number of Black babies aborted since Roe would equal the population of several large cities. She also said people are too casual about terminating pregnancies. You just can t take the life of someone because this is not convenient — ‘I want to finish my education.   Britton said.  You wouldn t kill your 2-year-old because you were in graduate school. But state Rep. Zakiya Summers of Jackson. who is Black and a mother. suggested there s nothing casual about what poor women are doing. Receiving little support in Mississippi — for example. the Legislature killed a proposal to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage in 2021 ― they are sometimes forced to make hard decisions. Women are just out here trying to survive. you know?  she said.  And Mississippi doesn t make it any easier. ____Associated Press reporters Noreen Nasir in Jackson.

Since 1973. Roe v. Wade has protected the right of all Americans to access safe and legal abortions. But the Supreme Court overturned it on Friday. taking away legal protection of abortion rights. Now. the legality of abortion will be determined by each state. And though a handful of states are passing legislation that will protect the right to get an abortion. many others — 26 to be exact — are expected to quickly ban or restrict abortions. If this happens. millions of people in the United States will no longer be able to access safe abortion care within their communities. They ll have to wait longer and travel farther to access help. The impact on people s mental and physical health — along with their finances. families and livelihoods — will be astronomical. Despite the misinformation that swirls around the internet (and beyond). abortions are extremely safe procedures. They re also incredible common — about 1 in 4 women will have an abortion by the time they are 45 — and. in many cases. they are life-saving.  It is a common procedure. it is very safe. and I can t emphasize that enough. This draft ruling is egregious. it is a basically a war against women.  Dr. Melissa Simon. a Northwestern Medicine OB/GYN. told HuffPost. One of the most common misconceptions about abortions is that the procedure is dangerous or detrimental to one s health. A report from 2018 examined the safety of various methods of abortion — medication. aspiration. dilation and evacuation. and induction — and concluded that abortions are safe and effective and that complications from all types of abortions are rare. It s the barriers and restrictions that legislators sign to prevent patients from easily and swiftly accessing abortion that jeopardize their health. It s well known that delaying abortion care increases the risk of complications. Some states require doctors to tell their patients that there s a link between breast cancer and abortion — despite the fact that many high-quality studies have put this question to rest. according to Dr. Jennifer Kerns. an associate professor in the department of obstetrics. gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California. San Francisco. Others fear that abortions cause infertility. but research hasn t found a link between abortions and the ability to conceive in the future. There s also no evidence that abortions increase the risk of complications (i.e. preterm birth or low birth weight delivery) in the event of a future pregnancy.Another long-running mistruth is that abortions increase the risk of developing mental health issues.  There is a huge body of work demonstrating that abortion in and of itself does not cause mental health problems.  Kerns said. noting that people often feel relief after getting an abortion. What we do know is that unwanted pregnancies can cause significant maternal depression and parenting stress. And those mental health issues don t clear up with time. they are often long-lasting. afflicting the women who carried the unwanted pregnancies to term well into their 30s. 40s and 50s. Many people falsely believe pregnancy is easy to avoid. but it s not that straightforward. Kerns sees many people. from all walks of life and phases of reproductive health. seeking an abortion. Contraception — though invaluable — is not foolproof. Birth control is not 100% effective. it can fail and lead to a pregnancy.  Even in the setting of using contraception and safe-sex practices. having the option of an abortion is critical to the life and both physical and mental health of the woman.  Simon said. Many anti-abortion bills have been labeled  heartbeat bills because they ban abortions at the first sign of fetal cardiac activity. This nomenclature is wildly misleading — while primordial electrical activity can be detected around six weeks of pregnancy. this does not mean a fetus has a functioning heart. The heart. valves and vessels do not form until 16-18 weeks of pregnancy.  Just having cardiac activity does not mean the fetus. if born at that moment. would be able to survive.  Simon said. Evidence shows that being denied an abortion has a devastating impact on one s physical health. mental health and overall well-being. The Turnaway StudyThey re also more likely to experience serious health complications. such as eclampsia and death. and to develop mental health issues. including anxiety. depression and suicidal ideation. They re more likely to stick with an abusive partner. their life goals tend to take a back seat. and their families  livelihoods suffer. Many go on to experience chronic pain.  The health and welfare of the citizens of this country suffer — we see increased illness. we see increased poverty and we see increased death.  Kerns said. Restricting the right to an abortion does not mean the need for an abortion disappears. A recent study predicted that banning abortion will lead to a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths. that jumps to 33% among Black women.Maternal mortality rates are at an all-time high. The United States already has the highest maternal death rate among developed nations — and that crisis would only get worse without access to safe abortion.  There are some women who get pregnant who could die if they continue with the pregnancy. and. therefore. an abortion is a life-saving procedure in those circumstances.  said Simon. adding that those circumstances are not rare. Abortions. in many cases. can save the life of the mother. Kerns said the leaked document demonstrated that the court is no longer a neutral group.  It really lays bare how out of touch their rulings are with people s lives.  Kerns said. Much of the language used in abortion restrictions and bans — like  abortionists  — really deeply divides people and shames those who get an abortion or provide an abortion. Simon says the fall of Roe reflects a crisis in women s health care. specifically when it comes to maternal health. The end of Roe marks a war against women and people who can get pregnant. who. for the record. comprise over 50% of the U.S. population. she added. Simon is exceedingly concerned about what will happen to the growing maternal death rate once Roe falls and safe abortion care becomes harder and harder to access.  That is what I am very worried about in this country — that we are going to go even more in the wrong direction than we already are with respect to caring for over half of our population: women.  Simon said. ,Health News
I am witness to my patients  stories. She was a princess.  she whispers as she wakens from her medicated sleep. A foreign prince is the father and he refuses to marry her. So she chooses her life over the princess s because. in her culture. having a baby out of wedlock is punishable by death.She is an engineer and was given 24 hours off work. With the new abortion law in her state. nearby clinics rejected her. So. she drives eight hours through the night to us. Her procedure is a longer one and she must leave us by 1 a.m. to get to work on time. She travels far even though there are services close to where she lives because some of her family members often protest there and she can t take the chance of them seeing her. They would crucify her. She doesn t have a soul to tell ― not even her sister. She used to be against abortion. just like them. until it happened to her. Her single-mom salary barely covers the bills for the child she already has: the day care. the food. the rent. Family and friends offer lots of parenting advice but no help. She travels from another state because she was told she needed her husband s permission to have her tubes tied. She simply can t survive having another baby. But he wants more. She drives hours in the early morning to us and drives hours back so he won t suspect a thing. The beatings ― too many beatings. She can t leave him. but at least she can choose to not have his baby.She was raped ― by a police officer. She is an addict getting clean. working with a rehab clinic. Another s mouth gapes open as she sleeps off the anesthesia and I see the rotten teeth of a meth addict. This is just not the right time for these women. for these babies. She wants to be a nurse. She wants to be a doctor.She wants to be a writer.She wants to be an actress.She wants to be a pilot.She wants to be a teenager. She just started a business and it s taking off. Her youngest child just started full-time school and now this woman can finally tend to her dreams. She chooses her dreams. She didn t want the pregnancy to be this far along. Now her procedure will take longer. be more expensive and more complicated. and it carries increased risk. But she couldn t get away until now ― her eye still slightly swollen with the marks of a healing bruise. She is a prisoner escorted by her prison guard. Another patient joins the three of us in the recovery room. her wartime post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by the anesthesia and maybe something else. She fears she is back in Iraq. The prison guard. also a military veteran. comes over and guides her through PTSD breathing exercises she learned from her counselor at Veterans Affairs. There is calm. I have learned a new skill. But then a new fear arises: She has to report this PTSD episode to her counselor. a man who makes her feel anything but safe. Who constantly compliments her blue eyes. The prison guard offers her the name of her own counselor. a woman. A circle of healing just happened before my eyes.The tests came back with chromosomal abnormalities. It would be her fourth child and she knows in her heart she can t handle it. She was offered the testing but not a solution. She has nowhere else to go but to us. She is told by her doctor that her baby could survive but probably wouldn t make it past a year. She desperately wants to give the baby a chance but her husband does not. The decision is made and the fetus enters the world. into our toilet. because both procedure rooms are occupied when she swiftly goes into induced labor. She is a trauma psychologist and has just been traumatized. She is a physician and he s been fooling around. She can t eat and hasn t for months. The nausea. the vomiting. she can t go to work like this but she needs to support her kids. She has already lost 20 pounds. She has three kids and is the primary caretaker of her father. who has Alzheimer s. How can she add a newborn to this? Something has to give. She makes the impossible choice. How do Iknow all of this? Because I am a woman. I am a mother. And in one city of one state in the U.S.. I am an abortion nurse. These are just a handful of the stories I ve heard from my patients. I could tell you a thousand more.They tell me these things as if to ask: Do you see me? Can you see what my choices were? Am I still  good ?The truth is women are not seen ― not as adults capable of making decisions about their bodies and their lives ― and people refuse to see what many of their choices actually are. Instead these people who know nothing about these women s circumstances choose to be ignorant and not to see. They do not see that these women are still good. How did they value her life as a fetus but refuse to value it now? The stripping of women s rights will not stop abortion. it will merely transmute her choice. She will instead choose a back alley. a home. or a TikTok tutorial. She may choose suicide. And when her choice is made. who will be her witness?Sherilyn Anne Kay is a pseudonym used by the nurse who wrote this essay to protect her safety.

Every so often. a new parenting style makes the headlines: attachment parenting. helicopter parenting. free-range parenting. But in child psychology. based on the work of Diana Baumrind. a developmental psychologist. experts point to four main parenting styles ― neglectful. authoritarian. authoritative and permissive ― that influence how children grow and interact. Bright HorizonsShe emphasized parents can fluctuate between styles depending on the situation ― and by having awareness and intention can make thoughtful choices and create habits that will help them raise their kids the way they want.  Simply being aware of effective parenting strategies can help a parent pause and act purposefully in a moment they may have otherwise acted instinctually or emotionally.  Robertson explained.  Parenting is an in-the-moment kind of activity but it also is really about the long game ― parents are raising human beings who we all hope grow to be contributing citizens. future leaders. lifelong learners and stewards of the future they will inherit. HuffPost spoke with Robertson and family therapist Kelly Oriard to break down the four parenting styles and how each approach affects children. ″[Neglectful] style is hands-off and uninvolved.  Robertson said.  This style may be intentional or unintentional. depending on the parent. Communication. interaction and involvement in activities is limited. To better understand neglectful parenting and the other three styles. it s important to consider emotional climate. which is basically the overall mood and perception of a family and the relationship dynamics within it.SlumberkinsIn the neglectful parenting style. there s low emotional warmth. as this type of caregiver tends to have low levels of interaction with their child.  When disciplining. these parents tend to choose harsher techniques and offer little to no explanation.  Oriard said.  This parent is like the boss who you barely see at work. You end up learning on the fly and figuring it out because direction and interaction is minimal. Then if you do make a mistake because of the low level of direction. your boss becomes enraged and takes it out on you in front of your peers and higher-ups. She noted that this type of boss would not circle back or touch base with you. might dismiss you on the spot and may leave you feeling anxious about making future mistakes. A neglectful parent can leave similar negative feelings.  Unfortunately. children who have neglectful-uninvolved parents tend to have numerous problems as they grow up.  Oriard said.  These children may have mental health struggles related to depression and anxiety. they may have poor social skills and can even be prone to future substance abuse.  Authoritarian parents expect children to listen. follow directions and obey.  Robertson said.  This style is considered to be strict and a disciplinarian. There is a lack of flexibility and high expectation of compliance. Similar to the neglectful parenting style. authoritarian parenting involves low emotional warmth. but what makes it different is a high level of demand and control ― terms that refer to the extent to which parents try to control their child s behavior and development. We all want our children to be accepted and liked and part of that is helping them to navigate social norms.  Oriard said.  When demandingness and control become problematic is when adults take an adult-centered approach and try to control their child for their benefit instead of for the betterment of the child. She noted that the authoritarian style s combination of low emotional warmth and high demandingness can feel particularly strict and cold. Without the emotional support. these kids can struggle socially and suffer from mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression.  Oriard explained.  This is due to the fact that high demandingness without a warm emotional climate can create an environment that is not only about behavioral control but psychological control. Psychological control is much harsher and uses shame and guilt to manipulate the child or coerce the child into doing what the caregiver wants or expects of them. Under her office analogy above. this scenario is like having a boss who only cares about productivity and goals and is relentless about how they achieve those goals. This boss doesn t seem to care about the employee as a person and fosters a cold. harsh and restrictive environment. Authoritative parents set clear expectations and provide structure and routine but remain flexible.  Robertson said.  There is a clear parent-child dynamic. but children are respected. listened to and given choices. Authoritative parents are nurturing and reliable. Research indicates that the authoritative style is the most beneficial for children s development and thus the style to strive for as a parent. It s about creating a warm emotional climate coupled with a healthy. moderate-to-high level of demandingness and control.  This is the boss that we all love working for.  Oriard said.  This boss is in the office and is friendly and welcoming to all of their employees. They know that Suzy fell off her bike last week and checked in to see how she was doing. This boss has high expectations of all their employees but communicates this openly and is willing to discuss trying things in a different way if you feel like it would help you. For children. an authoritative parent is supportive. responsive and nurturing. They are kind. caring and loving but also set firm limits and have high expectations. They explain their reasoning and listen to their child s viewpoint. even if they don t indulge it. When high expectations are coupled with a warm emotional climate. kids are better able to thrive.  Oriard said.  While neglectful-uninvolved parenting leads to numerous negative outcomes. authoritative parenting is known as the style that creates the most positive outcomes for children.  Permissive parents are warm and loving. but this style is without a lot of rules or structure.  Robertson noted.  Sometimes this parent would be described as more of a friend relationship than parental. There is a lot less direction or expectation and children are given a lot of autonomy and a voice in most decisions. If rules are set. they are often unenforced. Permissive parenting involves a warm emotional climate but low demandingness and control. If their child hits your child on the playground. they do not jump up to correct the behavior. they just let it go and chalk it up to kids being kids.  Oriard said.  In the office. this is the boss who doesn t exactly know what is up. They don t have a lot of demands and let you do your own thing. If you mess up a huge project. it s fine. No worries. You yelled at your client over the phone? Not a problem. She noted that children of permissive parents tend to have behavioral issues and struggle socially.  They might also struggle a bit at school or in environments where there are rules to follow.  Oriard added. Like the other styles. this one isn t fixed. There are practical ways to make changes to move away from a less effective style and more toward an authoritative style. If a parent tends to be more permissive and have informal schedules or unpredictability in routine. this can be tricky for children as they use routines and schedules to learn about the patterns of the day. what to expect. how to feel secure and what can be relied on.  Robertson said.  A permissive parent can start by creating a consistent bedtime routine. knowing this will help their child s development. Still. even the best of parents won t be authoritative 100% of the time. Everyone has days when they re less patient or more indulgent than they would normally be.,Health News

The past couple of years have not been good for many kids  mental health. but new data offers some devastating insight into the toll.Mental Health America released an analysisRates of suicidal ideation were also the highest among young people. especially LGBTQ+ youth. Overall. 51% of depression screeners in the 11-to-17 age range reported frequent suicidal ideation on more than half or nearly every day of the previous two weeks. That number rose to 52% for young people of color and 63% for youth who identified as LGBTQ+.  We want to draw attention to these numbers because it s reaching a crisis point.  Maddy Reinert. senior director population health at Mental Health America. told HuffPost.  The sheer number of people under age 18 who are struggling with their mental health and looking for resources and supports online is higher than ever before. She also noted that 9 in 10 young people ages 11 to 17 who screened themselves for depression on the website scored with symptoms of moderate to severe depression ― a higher rate than any other age group. Mental Health America s data was collected from its online screening program. which began in 2014 and consists of 10 free. anonymous. confidential and clinically-validated tools on the organization s website. It s important to note that the population taking these screeners are people seeking mental health help and resources. so they are more likely to test positive for these symptoms than the average individual. Still. Reinert believes the data ― particularly the uptick in young users seeking out these resources ― underscores the extent of the mental health crisis affecting American youth today.  Of course. we know that COVID-19 has really affected mental health. not only making us worry about our health and the health of our loved ones but also drastically changing our social environments.  she said.  About 70% of our 11-to-17-year-olds reported that loneliness or social isolation was contributing to their mental health problems. And we ve seen a lot more youth express concerns with financial insecurity. showing the impact of COVID-19 and job loss. More than 200.000 childrenFor some LGBTQ+ youth. there are issues stemming from being stuck at home in a household that isn t necessarily accepting of their identity. Feeling removed from schools. communities or other places where they felt more accepted or perhaps had access to trusted adults could also be a factor. And for people of color. there are rising reports of racism. as well as fear amid increasingly visible accounts of race-based violence in the U.S.  The situation is urgent.  Reinert said.  Maybe people assume. ‘Oh well it s because of COVID. and once that starts to go away. things will get better and rates will go down.  But we re seeing a massive mental health impact that s going to continue if we don t act now. This problem isn t going away. We were approaching crisis state before the pandemic. and the pandemic put a giant magnifying glass over a problem that was already there.   We should be screening all young people for mental health conditions the same way we screen their hearing and eyesight.  said Schroeder Stribling. the president and CEO of Mental Health America.  We should also be promoting positive social engagement and encouraging healthy coping strategies for stress and negative emotions ― especially as they emerge from a long period of social isolation and disruption in their daily lives. She emphasized the importance of prevention. early identification and intervention in mental health care. For young people. that means having access to equitable. affordable. compassionate and nonjudgmental support and resources in their communities and schools ― whether it s through counselors. psychologists or even just trusted adults.  Parents have a simple but vital role and that is to listen and be supportive.  Stribling added.  If your child feels they may be struggling with a mental health condition. believe them. validate how they are feeling and offer help in getting them support. We hear disappointing stories of young people that are suffering but do not feel believed or supported by a parent or caregiver ― and conversely. we know that a supportive caregiver can make all the difference in helping youth through crisis and into recovery and well-being. Ensuring that all crisis and preventative mental health services for youths are meaningfully covered by public and private health insurance is also crucial. as this is not currently the case.  Social media is a piece of the puzzle as well.  Stribling added.  We need to take a hard look at social media platforms and find ways to minimize content that is damaging to youth mental health. well documentedYoung people should be mindful of the impact social media can have on their mental health. If they feel they are experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition. they can take an online screening to start.  The next step is to share the results of that screening with a parent. teacher. physician. school counselor or other trusted adult to begin a conversation about getting support.  Stribling said.Mental Health America s websiteThe Trevor ProjectThe Jed FoundationMinding Your Mind Young people can also become advocates in their schools and communities.  Stribling said.  We work with a number of youth who are leading the charge to get more accessible mental health supports and services in their areas. There are no voices more powerful than youth themselves. and we encourage young people to get involved with mental health advocacy. ,Health News

that may ultimately rob people of their reproductive freedomDuring these moments. I think of a little girl in an exam room I met many years ago. She was my patient. She was 11. We will call her Sophia.It was my first year in practice doing bread-and-butter primary care. Sophia s mom had brought her in for stomach pain. When I got to her menstrual history. her mom said Sophia had gotten her period but then it had stopped. I reassured her and said sometimes at the start of menstruation. there can be some irregularity and that is not uncommon at all. The mother then left the room and it was just me and Sophia. She was quiet and soft-spoken — a par-for-the-course. awkward adolescent who was uncomfortable interacting with an adult. She answered my questions with one-word responses and didn t quite know where to look. When I left the room. I heard the booming voice in my head of an ER doctor who had trained me:  Don t be the ass who doesn t order the pregnancy test.  This was one of her clinical teaching pearls: Many young docs will order the blood tests. the ultrasound. the CT scans. but skip the most obvious. most basic test and spend tens of thousands of dollars to work up a patient when the  diagnosis  is actually pregnancy.Hence. don t be the ass who doesn t order the pregnancy test. So I ordered it.A few minutes later. our medical assistant came to me. panicked. and handed me a positive test.  Run it again.  I asked her. agape. She ran it again. Positive.  Run it again.  I sputtered — to buy some time and gather my wits and hope by some miracle it would produce a different result. Positive.She was my patient. She was 11. She was pregnant.I sat Sophia s mom down in another room and quietly explained to her that the pregnancy test came back positive. She didn t understand. I had to repeat myself multiple times in various ways for her to comprehend that Sophia was pregnant. Shock. tears. a cellphone call. Soon a breathless dad showed up. followed by a somber family priest. and then the cops. I remember the adults weeping in a prayer circle in a separate room and the feeling of watching a nightmare unfold. and I had to remind myself that. sometimes. the job is bearing witness to the worst day of someone s life. I tried in vain to coax the truth of what happened out of Sophia. sitting next to her with a large anatomy atlas flipped open in my lap. She said nothing. I was thankful there was a female police officer that was among the throng at the clinic. It was this officer. when permitted to speak with Sophia. who discovered the identity of the family member that did this awful. unspeakable thing to her. And when the cops left to arrest that relative. they headed to church. because the perpetrator was at choir practice. I recall my focus ― my clear understanding that my only job was to ensure that I was there to protect my patient. That whatever happened. my job was to make sure that at every moment. Sophia was centered. and her mental and physical health were the priority. To make sure that she could find her way. in the midst of this trauma and unspeakable crime. and that her precious life was protected. And part of that included a pregnancy termination. We would make certain she had access to it and was able to get it immediately.There was no question that Sophia s life mattered and it mattering meant that she would not be forced to give birth at age 11. And she wasn t.I think about Sophia all the time. especially these days. I think about all the Sophias in clinics like mine. as abortion protections are struck down in state after state ― protections falling like wicked dominoes. I think about the words  except in cases of the life of the mother.  The choice made that evening of the awful revelation was for the life of the mother. A mother that should have never been and thankfully wasn t. And though it might be easier to build consensus around abortion access for an 11-year-old raped by a family member. the truth is that nobody. anywhere. under any circumstance or in any situation should be forced to give birth. Forced birth should never be a reality.Sophia is in her 20s now. I wonder how she has healed. how she has processed that trauma. Did she get to go to college? Has she been able to trust an intimate partner? Has she been pregnant on her own terms at the time of her choosing? Does she have a child? I can see her wide face and her soft smile in my mind s eye and I know now. just as I knew then. that the decision to terminate Sophia s pregnancy. supported by the ones who loved her the most. was a pro-life decision. One of the things my mind conjures up from that horrible day is the feeling that the clinic was crowded. There was Sophia. her mom. then her dad and the priest. and later the cops. There was the crying and the praying and the disbelieving and the believing. I remember how small Sophia looked. Her small face and her small hands and her small hips and how this big. awful thing could happen to someone so small took the wind out of the place.I remember how tiny that clinic room felt. There was no room for politicians signing evil bills flanked by child props as old as Sophia. no room for Supreme Court justices who claim to value life while wondering aloud how pregnancy can be an undue burden. No room for those extraneous. unnecessary. useless others in that most intimate of spaces. Our clinic rooms will always be too small for anybody but providers and our patients.And we will fight for this sacred space. fight for it to be free of cynical politicians and their divisive games. They have never been invited in and we are not about to sit back or stand by while they force their way in.Note: Names and specific details have been changed to protect the privacy and safety of individuals mentioned in this essay.Dipti S.

I m in the back of my parents  red Ford Monarch. The sky is clear. and the night air is still too warm for a jacket. My father is driving. and the smoke from his Kool Mild hits me like an anvil. I m seatbelt-less. The window is halfway down. It looks like the moon is chasing our car.This was back in the  80s. when Bill Cosby was a god. back when cars were made like tanks. and everyone had a telephone in their home. Back when cable was only a few channels. and a smoker could smoke anywhere: in the office. restaurants. and if you were nice with it. even on a public bus. I ve seen it.We were wild back then. no one cared back then. Everyone appears to care now ― about Black lungs. about Black health.The government is planning to ban menthol cigarettes. and it feels racist-y.Let me explain.In 1925. Lloyd  Spud  Hughes wasn t feeling so hot. He was an avid smoker. but he d picked up a cold somewhere. One night he put his smoking tobacco next to his menthol crystals. and the next day menthol cigarettes were born.Before this. cigarettes had tasted like trash. But for some reason. white men and some white women still smoked them. It was a luxury item for rich folks (remember those long black cigarette holders from all of those black-and-white movies? Looking at you.  Breakfast at Tiffany s ). and as such. Black folks didn t partake. Eventually. though. cigarette makers realized something: Because they didn t target African Americans. Black people weren t smoking cigarettes.So that all changed. In the 1970s and  80s. the makers of Kools began sponsoring jazz festivals. and their advertisements started featuring dimly lit images of a saxophone player. Even the spelling of  Kool  with a  K  was used to target Black people. since that was hip talk at the time. Kool and Newports changed their marketing campaigns to aggressively target Black folks in the two most prominent African American publications. Ebony and Jet. which reached a third of the adult Black population. Almost a third of the ads in both magazines were for cigarettes.And it worked: Blacks became the largest users of menthol cigarettes.In 1964. after researching some 7.000 articles. Surgeon General Luther Terry concluded that cigarette smoking led to lung cancer and heart disease. Surely. this would be enough to take the product off the market? Nope. Despite Terry s insistence that the government do something about cigarettes. they just kept on allowing them to be sold. Oh. wait. that isn t entirely true. They did issue a warning that appeared on the side of the packaging. acknowledging that cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health ― but they didn t do it until 1969. some five years after Terry s findings. That language would be changed in 1984 after Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984. which required that all cigarette packaging and advertisements carry the following message:  SURGEON GENERAL S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer. Heart Disease. Emphysema. and May Complicate Pregnancy. This brings us to the Heckler report. Before 1985. no one really cared about health disparities based on race. Well. maybe they cared. but no one kept track of it until 1985. when U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler released the Report of the Secretary s Task Force on Black & Minority Health. marking the first time the U.S. government looked at whether race played a part in health care.One of the report s most shocking findings was that some 60.000 excess deaths occurred in the U.S. each year due to health disparities. This was about as close as America had come to admitting that racism exists in medical care. It was the first time race and health care converged on a national stage. Inside the voluminous report. there was a finding that Blacks suffered more than their white counterparts from high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.If America could do a study of this scope in 1985 (the task force was created in 1984. and the report was released the following year). surely they could ve taken a look at the effects that menthol cigarettes had on Black people. especially since it had long been rumored that menthol made cigarettes easier to smoke and harder to quit. But that study wouldn t be done until 1998. And the 1998 Surgeon General s report  Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups found one minor caveat that no one seemed to care about then.New York Times articleThis means Black smokers were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes and. as such. were more likely to die. America knew this in 1998. Want to know how long ago that was? Today. a child who was born in 1998 can drive a car. go to war and legally purchase and smoke menthol cigarettes. So we know. at the very least. that America was aware of the dangers of smoking menthol cigarettes some 24 years ago. and did nothing to stop it.But before we look at why the ban to stop menthol cigarettes from ravishing the Black community is suddenly happening now. let s look at the effects that menthol had on the industry. Adding menthol to tobacco lessened the harsh taste and made cigarettes easier to smoke. So why not create all kinds of flavors to entice new smokers? Well. in recent years. that s precisely what flavored e-cigarettes did. with great new tastes like Gummy Bear. Funnel Cake. Fruit Punch. Berry Crunch Cereal and Blueberry Lemonade. Surely that lasted for some time. considering how long menthol was on the market?Nope. Shortly after those flavors hit the market. the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned them.  Flavors attract them. Nicotine addicts them.  Matthew Myers. president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. said.  Without the flavors. many fewer kids would be attracted to these products — 85% of the kids who use an e-cigarette use a flavored one. But it wasn t just the assortment of flavors. It was menthol.  Flavors are a top reason why young people begin using e-cigarettes.  an April 22 report by Truth Initiative.  Research shows that mint and menthol e-cigarette use among high school users rose from 16% in 2016 to 57.3% in 2019. Among high school JUUL users. 67.5% reported that their preferred flavor was mint or menthol. Another study. conducted before JUUL pulled its other flavors from the market. found that mint was one of the most popular flavors among high school student JUUL users. but that menthol was less so.  Study authors caution that leaving mint and menthol flavors on the market undermines the purpose of removing flavors — which is to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes at all.  the report notes.White males are the most likely to use e-cigarettes. See where I m going here? No need to belabor the point.I don t have a memory of my father that isn t clouded in smoke from a Kool Mild. He never stopped smoking. Not after two heart attacks. not after he stopped eating. My last memory of my father is from around my birthday. I d taken my kids to see him. He was frail and could barely hold himself upright. He shuffled to walk my family out of the house. and waved as we pulled off. I could see in my rearview mirror that he was lighting a cigarette.The ban on menthol cigarettes is long overdue. but America knows that. Black lives have always been a byproduct of white life. our safety a spinoff. It s the impetus of the Black Lives Matter movement ― you know. the part that always gets left out. implicitly saying.  Don t I matter. too? ,Health News

Roe v.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Dr. Morton Mower. a former Maryland-based cardiologist who helped invent an automatic implantable defibrillator that has helped countless heart patients live longer and healthier. has died at age 89.Funeral services were held Wednesdayreported. Mower and Dr. Michel Mirowski. both colleagues at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. began working in 1969 on developing a miniature defibrillator that could be implanted into a patient. The device would correct a patient s over-rapid or inefficient heartbeat with an electric shock to resume its regular rhythm. It was the talk of the whole hospital that these two crazy guys are going to put in an automatic defibrillator.  Mower said in a 2015 interview with The Lancet medical journal.  If something had gone awry. we would have never lived it down. We were these two crazy guys who wanted to put a time bomb in people s chests. so to speak. The physicians had. in a matter of months. a model of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for demonstration. But it wasn t until 1980 that the device was implanted into a human at Johns Hopkins Hospital. the newspaper reported.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the device in 1985. Both doctors shared the patent for the device. the technology of which was sold to pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. Mower later became director of medical research for the Eli Lilly division that produced the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. according to the newspaper. I think Morty had as much influence successfully finding a treatment for sudden death as anyone in our profession.  said Dr. David Cannom. a retired Los Angeles cardiologist and longtime friend.The device  proved that it was better than medication in treating arrhythmia. and they did this against all odds at a small hospital in Baltimore.  Cannom added.  And for the past 40 years. it has proven that it s reliable  while saving many lives.Mower. a Baltimore native who grew up in Frederick. attended Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He worked at Baltimore hospitals and served in the Army before beginning his professional career at Sinai in 1966 as a co-investigator of its Coronary Drug Project. He was chief or acting chief of cardiology at the hospital for several years in the 1970s and 1980s. Sinai Hospital named a medical office building for him in 2005.Later in his career. he was a consultant or executive for several medical companies. He continued his research and worked up until his death.  his son. Mark Mower. of Beverly Hills. California. wrote in an email to the newspaper.  He never wanted to waste a moment of his life. Mower received many awards. including a 2002 induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He also was involved in many Jewish charitable organizations. One group. Jewish National Fund-USA. praised him for his fundraising efforts toward water infrastructure. education and community centers in Israel. Mower and his wife of 57 years. Toby. had visited Israel weeks before his death. As a medical inventor. his innovations restarted the hearts of millions. yet he also gave a heartbeat to an entire nation – the land and people of Israel.  Jewish National Fund-USA CEO Russell F. Robinson said in a news release.In addition to his wife and son. Mower is survived by his daughter. Robin Sara Mower of Denver. and three grandchildren.,Health News

myth that it causes cancerlink the assisted reproduction methodKris Jenner The medication that they ve been giving me. they put me into menopause.  she says at one point.  Literally into menopause. But is this even possible? HuffPost spoke to some experts to find out.  There are no validated studies which support the statement that the medications used in IVF treatment brings about early menopause.  said Dr. Luis Murrain. a reproductive genetics and fertility specialist at Dreams Fertility in Palm Springs. California.The IVF process involves taking medications to stimulate the ovaries so that they produce as many mature follicles (sacs that contain eggs) as possible. Once the eggs are retrieved. they are fertilized with sperm to form embryos. One or multiple embryos are then transferred to the uterus. A woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have.  explained Dr. Joel Batzofin. co-founder and medical director at Dreams Fertility.  From puberty on. a cohort of follicles sacs will ‘come forward  each month. From that cohort. one dominant follicle emerges and releases an egg. which is ovulated. and the rest of the follicles die off. With the intervention of IVF medication. those other follicles are rescued and also release eggs. which are retrieved.  The hormones and medications used in IVF simply result in growth and development of the follicles the individual was destined to lose in that month. regardless of whether or not she did IVF.  Batzofin noted.  Stated differently. as a woman ages. each month she will lose a cohort of follicles/eggs from her remaining pool of eggs. This will continue until the entire cohort is depleted. at which time menopause ensues. The drugs used in IVF do not speed up this depletion.  Madame Ovary Some of the medications which can be used are like Lupron. which indeed does put you into temporary menopause ― while you are taking the medications. It s not permanent and goes away when you stop taking the medication. but temporarily it can feel like menopause. She noted that these menopause-esque side effects include hot flashes. night sweats and insomnia. Some might experience mood changes. headaches. bloating. vaginal dryness and fatigue as well. feel Now the other possibility that some folks experience is that menopause can occur very early.  Minkin said.  The decline in fertility in those women starts occurring before menopause. She noted that the average age of menopause in the U.S. is 51. though some women can experience it as early as 35. Let s say someone is having trouble getting pregnant. and it turns out that she is heading towards menopause at an early age.  Minkin added.  She may. indeed. be experiencing some of what we call perimenopausal symptoms as she is being treated for her infertility. PerimenopauseWhatever age or context you start experiencing menopausal symptoms. just know that your IVF treatments likely did not put you there. Anything is possible in the body. but Kourtney Kardashian s claim is very unlikely to happen.  Batzofin said.  There are no studies showing that IVF drugs cause early onset menopause. ,Health News

I m not sure what s wrong with me. but I do know a lot of things I don t have. When I began experiencing mysterious nerve-related symptoms in early 2019. I was tested for multiple sclerosis. lupus. lyme disease. a B12 deficiency. and a host of other things over the course of several months. I had countless blood tests. two MRIs. and one particularly strange test where a doctor used something (this is not correct. but cattle prod comes to mind) to stimulate the nerves in my legs and feet to see if they were working properly. And work they did. So well. in fact. that I nearly kicked the nurse in the face.  We usually do this test on old guys with diabetes. they just lie there.  the nurse said with a somewhat comforting frankness. Wanting to do a good job on the test ― I ve always had a bit of a goody-goody streak ― I d braced myself to withstand the painful shocks. not realizing until returning home that I d pressed my hand against my chin so hard that all of the blood vessels in it broke. leaving my chin (one of the few non-cattle-prodded parts of me) red and bruised. upLhermitte s signI knowessential tremor.mightfibromyalgiaMy doctor recommended exercise. which sounded like a rather anticlimactic treatment.

Through some mix of determination and privilege and luck. I still haven t found out. I ve never seen that little pink strip on COVID rapid test. And although I doubt my lungs are impacted by my pre-existing shruggy condition. I ve always been particularly concerned about long-haul COVID. I m already long-haulin  something. and I d prefer not to add any more freight. one in 10 Americans havethe meanestBut I still want to get in. After a year of doggedly pursuing a diagnosis. I stopped talking about my symptoms almost entirely ― even to my spouse. It had become pretty clear that I wasn t going to solve the puzzle. so instead. I just wanted to pretend they didn t exist. To the best of my ability. I all but ignored my symptoms.Recently. I had to bring them up to my spouse during a conversation about finances. He simply couldn t understand why I wanted to save the amount I did. (And. to be fair to him. we are pretty much at the end of the world. yeah? Why not get an arcade machine?) that I m not 100% fine 30 million Americans live with a rare illnessI must find the source at all costsI need to live as healthy as I can and be happy with the health I do haveThat outlook keeps me (mostly) sane. but it also involves letting go of a certain amount of hope. I no longer hope that my symptoms will go away because hoping would mean focusing on them. I had to accept a failing grade in order to move on. That might sound familiar to people with long-haul COVID. At some point. you shift away from hope and to the practical: to managing symptoms. to living as well as you can. to hoping nothing gets worse.When I had a close contact with a positive case at work in fall 2021. I was told.  Oh. you ll be fine.  from someone who had truly no idea whether or not I d be fine. This comment was no doubt influenced by the fact that I live in the Midwest. and pretty much everyone displays a  tougher-than-thou  attitude when it comes to the COVID. How I d love the luxury of choosing that attitude. But. truthfully. I was a little glad that person made the comment she did. Because I badly want to belong in the group she thinks I belong in ― where the healthy people are ― where I maybe. kinda. sorta do belong. For now. I can still sneak in.

Hailey BieberJustin BieberIt made her  fingertips feel really numb and weird.  she said. When her husband noticed something wrong and asked if she felt okay. she said the right side of her face began to droop and she suddenly couldn t speak.  Immediately I thought I was having a stroke. like a full-blown stroke.  the 25-year-old said.Justin Bieber asked someone to call 911 and a medic came over and began tending to the stricken model. It was  definitely the scariest moment of my life.  she said. adding that she feared she would have permanent issues. Once she got to the hospital and began undergoing tests. Bieber said doctors discovered a small blood clot in her brain. She was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack. which the Mayo Clinic says can have symptoms similar to a stroke. Later. Bieber said doctors found a related problem called a patent foramen ovale — a prenatal hole between heart chambers that failed to close after birth. Beiber said the opening in her heart was judged the worst grade possible. and she underwent surgery to successfully close it.risk factor for strokeBieber said her doctors think a blood clot reached her brain because of the hole in her heart. They had three theories to explain why she developed a clot in the first place.  I had just recently started birth control pills. which I should ve never been on because I am someone who suffers from migraines anyway. and I just did not talk to my doctor about this.  Bieber said.  So. ladies. if you suffer from bad migraines and you plan on being on birth control pills. make sure you tell your doctor. Because having a stroke is a potential side effect from birth control pills. She continued:  The second thing is I had recently had COVID. And then the third thing is I had recently gone on a very long flight. I had flown to Paris and back in a very short time. The conditions created a  perfect storm  for the clot. Bieber said her doctors told her.  It s hard for me to tell this story.  she added.  But I felt like it was important for me to share this because it was already a public situation.  model quickly confirmed spoke about the worrying incident Most of you probably know. or seen. the news about my wife ... she s OK. she s good. she s strong.  he said at the time.

Climate change will result in thousands of new viruses spread among animal species by 2070 — and that s likely to increase the risk of emerging infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans. according to a new study.This is especially true for Africa and Asia. continents that have been hotspots for deadly disease spread from humans to animals or vice versa over the last several decades. including the flu. HIV. Ebola and coronavirus.Naturerecent researchThey found that cross-species virus spread will happen over 4.000 times among mammals alone. Birds and marine animals weren t included in the study.Researchers said not all viruses will spread to humans or become pandemics the scale of the coronavirus but the number of cross-species viruses increases the risk of spread to humans.The study highlights two global crises — climate change and infectious disease spread — as the world grapples with what to do about both.deforestation and extinctionwildlife trade We don t talk about climate a lot in the context of zoonoses  — diseases that can spread from animals to people. said study co-author Colin Carlson. an assistant professor of biology at Georgetown University.  Our study ... brings together the two most pressing global crises we have. Experts on climate change and infectious disease agreed that a warming planet will likely lead to increased risk for the emergence of new viruses.Daniel R. Brooks. a biologist at University of Nebraska State Museum and co-author of the book  The Stockholm Paradigm: Climate Change and Emerging Disease.  said the study acknowledges the threat posed by climate change in terms of increasing risk of infectious diseases. This particular contribution is an extremely conservative estimate for potential  emerging infectious disease spread caused by climate change. said Brooks.Aaron Bernstein. a pediatrician and interim director of The Center for Climate. Health. and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. said the study confirms long-held suspicions about the impact of warming on infectious disease emergence. Of particular note is that the study indicates that these encounters may already be happening with greater frequency and in places near where many people live.  Bernstein said.Study co-author Gregory Albery. a disease ecologist at Georgetown University. said that because climate-driven infectious disease emergence is likely already happening. the world should be doing more to learn about and prepare for it. It is not preventable. even in the best case climate change scenarios.  Albery said.Carlson. who was also an author on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. said we must cut greenhouse gas and phase out fossil fuels to reduce the risk of infectious disease spread.Jaron Browne. organizing director of the climate justice group Grassroots Global Justice Alliance. said the study highlights climate injustices experienced by people living in African and Asian nations. African and Asian nations face the greatest threat of increased virus exposure. once again illustrating how those on the frontlines of the crisis have very often done the least to create climate change.

Moderna on Thursday asked U.S. regulators to authorize low doses of its COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 6. a long-awaited move toward potentially opening shots for millions of tots by summer.people shed masks and other public health precautionsModerna submitted data to the Food and Drug Administration that it hopes will prove two low-dose shots can protect babies. toddlers and preschoolers ― albeit not as effectively during the omicron surge as earlier in the pandemic. There is an important unmet medical need here with these youngest kids.  Dr. Paul Burton. Moderna s chief medical officer. told The Associated Press. Two kid-size shots  will safely protect them. I think it is likely that over time they will need additional doses. But we re working on that. Now. only children ages 5 or older can be vaccinated in the U.S.. using rival Pfizer s vaccine. leaving 18 million younger tots unprotected.disappointing discovery that two doses weren t quite strong enough.Whether it s one company s shots or both. FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency will  move quickly without sacrificing our standards  in deciding if tot-sized doses are safe and effective.While questions are swirling about what s taking so long. Marks pointedly told lawmakers this week that the FDA can t evaluate a product until a manufacturer completes its application. FDA will publicly debate the evidence with its scientific advisers before making a decision. and Marks said multiple meetings would be set to cover several expected applications. It s critically important that we have the proper evaluation so that parents will have trust in any vaccines that we authorize.  Marks told a Senate committee.If FDA clears vaccinations for the littlest. next the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would have to recommend who needs them ― all tots or just those at higher risk from COVID-19.Many parents are desperate for whichever vaccine gets to the scientific finish line first. We ve been kind of left behind as everybody else moves on.  said Meagan Dunphy-Daly. a Duke University marine biologist whose 6-year-old daughter is vaccinated ― but whose 3-year-old and 18-month-old sons are part of Pfizer s trial.The family continues to mask and take other precautions until it s clear if the boys got real vaccine or dummy shots. If it turns out they weren t protected in the Pfizer study and Moderna s shots are cleared first. Dunphy-Daly said she d seek them for her sons. I will feel such a sense of relief when I know my boys are vaccinated and that the risk of them getting a serious infection is so low.  she said.Some parents even have urged the government to let families choose shots before all the evidence is in. This strain of COVID feels almost impossible to dodge.  Dana Walker. a mother of an 8-month-old. tearfully told a CDC meeting last week.  Cut red tape and allow parents to protect their kids. The FDA will face some complex questions.In a study of kids ages 6 months through 5 years. two Moderna shots — each a quarter of the regular dose — triggered high levels of virus-fighting antibodies. the same amount proven to protect young adults. Burton said. There were no serious side effects. and the shots triggered fewer fevers than other routine vaccinations.But the vaccine proved between about 40% and 50% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 during the trial. Burton blamed the omicron variant s ability to partially evade vaccine immunity. noting that unboosted adults showed similarly less effectiveness against milder omicron infections. While no children became severely ill during the study. he said high antibody levels are a proxy for protection against more serious illness — and the company will test a child booster dose.Another issue: So far in the U.S.. Moderna s vaccine is restricted to adults. Other countries have expanded the shot to kids as young as 6. But months ago the FDA cited concern about a rare side effect. heart inflammation. in teen boys. and it hasn t ruled on Moderna s earlier pediatric applications.Burton said the FDA may consider its vaccine for children of all ages — but also might open it first to the youngest kids who have no other option. He said safety data from millions of older children given Moderna vaccinations abroad should help reassure parents.While COVID-19 generally isn t as dangerous in youngsters as adults. some do become severely ill or even die. About 475 children younger than 5 have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic s start. according to the CDC. and child hospitalizations soared at omicron s peak.Yet it s not clear how many parents intend to vaccinate the youngest kids. Less than a third of children ages 5 to 11 have had two vaccinations. and 58% of those ages 12 to 17.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

We are at a low level right now. so if you re saying are we are out of the pandemic phase in this country. we are.  Fauci said Tuesday.He cautioned that  we re not going to eradicate this virus.  meaning that intermittent vaccinations. annually or longer. will be needed to ensure cases don t rise again.While cases have generally dropped and plateaued in the U.S. ― where vaccinations have been made widely available ― globally. cases continue to hit pandemic proportions. he said.

The U.S. seems to be losing track of COVID-19 as cases remain massively undercounted. in part due to the rise of at-home testing.most positive COVID cases were detected by at-home rapid tests out of the pandemic phase Time magazineFor now. there is no centralized system in the U.S. for people to report their at-home test results.The challenge of reporting an accurate count of positive COVID cases is hardly new. though.  We ve had undercounting throughout the whole pandemic. right? And that has always been an issue.  Dr. Ashish Jha. the White House COVID-19 coordinator. told the  Today  show on NBC earlier this month.It s also an issue experienced by many countries. not just the U.S.Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. the World Health Organization s director-general. welcomed the decline in reported cases and deaths. He said the agency recorded the lowest weekly total in COVID-related deaths since March 2020. but warned the emergence of a new. dangerous variant is still possible.  As many countries reduce testing. WHO is receiving less and less information about transmission and sequencing.  Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday.  This makes us increasingly blind to patterns of transmission and evolution. But this virus won t go away just because countries stop looking for it. Adhanom Ghebreyesus added we are still studying long-term consequences for people who contract the virus. When it comes to a deadly virus. ignorance is not bliss.  he warned.Meanwhile. Fauci. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. told PBS NewsHour on Tuesday that the U.S. is no longer seeing record-high numbers of cases. deaths and hospitalizations. The E.U. said Wednesday it is moving from the emergency phase of COVID. but urged countries to increase testing. Moving from emergency to more coordination will be essential to be ready for new outbreaks and variants.  the European Commission said in a tweet.endedaccording to the BBCThe U.K. government says it is following a  living with COVID  approach. But Dr. Stephen Griffin. virologist at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds. said the government is ignoring the prevalence of the virus. which he called  a mistake.  By not understanding how prevalent things are. people aren t going to react to it.  Griffin told HuffPost.  And the more that we don t hear about it. the further away from people s minds it is.  Griffin also warned about the difficulties of identifying future variants of concern. By doing less sequencing. you re less likely to pick up those variants which might be coming in.  Griffin said.  And of course. the U.K. contributes massively to the global surveillance operation. So again. if we re not doing that. there s less awareness on the whole. of what s going on globally. ,Health News

Also. the drug will now be distributed directly to pharmacies. in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to boost the number of sites from 20.000 to more than 30.000 next week and eventually to 40.000 locations.The administration used the pharmacy channel to boost availability of COVID-19 vaccines more than a year ago. Paxlovid will be widely available everywhere in America.  said Dr. Ashish Jha. the White House COVID-19 response coordinator. The drug and antivirals like it  are the key essential tools that we re going to need to get through the rest of this pandemic.  he said.Kamala Harristested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesdaythe coronavirusthe omicron waveThe administration has warned that subsequent deliveries are dependent on Congress approving additional COVID-19 response funding What we need to do is to help American physicians and nurse practitioners and others who can prescribe understand that we now have plenty available and anybody who is eligible. anybody who has high risk. should be getting Paxlovid.  Jha said.He also encouraged people who test positive to contact their doctors to determine their eligibility for the drug that might prevent severe outcomes.The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer s drug for adults and children age 12 or older with a positive COVID-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease. though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems.The administration is also working to expand the number of test-to-treat sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with COVID-19 to get tested for the virus. consult with a medical professional if they re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site. Currently there are 2.200 locations nationwide. and the administration hopes support from the Department of Health and Human Services. the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies will enable more sites to come online in the coming weeks.,Health News

coronavirusThey foundThe most striking increase was in children. The percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45% in December to about 75% in February.For Americans of all ages. about 34% had signs of prior infection in December. Just two months later. 58% did. I did expect it to increase. I did not expect it to increase quite this much.  said Dr. Kristie Clarke. co-leader of a CDC team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections.The older people were. the less likely they had evidence of past infections. the study found. For those 65 and older. 19% had signs of prior infection in December and 33% did in February. That may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other COVID-19 precautions. such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Clarke said.Clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection. and possibly longer.Studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization. but CDC officials stressed that the previously infected should still get COVID-19 vaccines.The study looked for any detectable level of antibodies. it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective. Scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures.Officials continue to urge Americans to get vaccines and boosters. which offer additional protection against COVID-19 for all. including those who were previously infected.___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

A disaster-weary globe will be hit harder in the coming years by even more catastrophes colliding in an interconnected world. a United Nations report issued Monday says.United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reductionclimate changeCOVID-19People have not grasped how much disasters already cost today. said Mami Mizutori. chief of the UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction.  If we don t get ahead of the curve it will reach a point where we cannot manage the consequences of disaster.  she said.  We re just in this vicious cycle. That means society needs to rethink how it finances. handles and talks about the risk of disasters and what it values the most. the report said. About 90% of the spending on disasters currently is emergency relief with only 6% on reconstruction and 4% on prevention. Mizutori said in an interview Monday.Not every hurricane or earthquake has to turn into a disaster. Mizutori said. A lot of damage is avoided with planning and prevention.In 1990. disasters cost the world about $70 billion a year. Now they cost more than $170 billion a year. and that s after adjusting for inflation. according to report authors. Nor does that include indirect costs we seldom think about that add up. Mizutori said.For years disaster deaths were steadily decreasing because of better warnings and prevention. Mizutori said. But in the last five years. disaster deaths are  way more  than the previous five years. said report co-author Roger Pulwarty. a U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and social scientist.That s because both COVID-19 and climate change disasters have come to places that didn t used to get them. like tropical cyclones hitting Mozambique. Mizutori said. It s also the way disasters interact with each other. compounding damage. like wildfires plus heatwaves or a war in Ukraine plus food and fuel shortages. Pulwarty said.Pulwarty said if society changes the way it thinks about risk and prepares for disasters. then the recent increase in yearly disaster deaths could be temporary. otherwise it s probably  the new abnormal. Disasters are hitting poorer countries harder than richer ones. with recovery costs taking a bigger chunk out of the economy in nations that can t afford it. co-author Markus Enenkel of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative said. These are the events that can wipe out hard-earned development gains. leading already vulnerable communities or entire regions into a downward spiral.  he said.The sheer onslaught of disasters just add up. like little illnesses attacking and weakening the body s immune system. Pulwarty said.The report calls for an overhaul in how we speak about risk. For example. instead of asking about the chances of a disaster happening this year. say 5%. officials should think about the chances over a 25-year period. which makes it quite likely. Talking about 100-year floods or chances of something happening a couple times in 100 years makes it seem distant. Mizutori said. In a world of distrust and misinformation. this is a key to moving forward.  said University of South Carolina Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute Co-Director Susan Cutter. who wasn t part of the report.  We can move forward to reduce the underlying drivers of risk: Inequality. poverty and most significantly climate change. ___https://apnews.com/hub/climate___@borenbears___here,Health News
Compression cubes. Dopp kits. Garment bags. There are lots of great products on the market to help keep your suitcase organized when you travel. But one crucial type of item aids with organization and perhaps more importantly. hygiene. We re talking about shoe bags. While some people feel comfortable simply throwing their shoes in with their clothing and other luggage items. the more germ-conscious among us might think twice. After all. do you really want the dirty bottoms of your sneakers or work shoes coming into contact with your clean clothes?Philip M. TiernoHe noted that the level of  germiness  in a pair of shoes depends on multiple factors. like the design of the shoes. the place where you walk in them and how often they re washed.  If the bottom of the shoe has ridges or there s ribbing on the side or other areas that can collect material. then think about what they re picking up.  Tierno explained.  Depending on the city where you re living. you re likely walking on sidewalks and streets where people cough. spit and vomit. There s urine. human and animal feces and a whole host of other things that are relatively germy. can contain millionsincluding E. coli Some sweat more than others. and they carry staphylococcus aureus. which can be spread from the inside of the shoe. in addition to whatever you might find on the bottom.  Tierno noted.  The sweat also imparts odor. which can spread around the suitcase.  People do the strangest things in public. and walking on the street. you can pick up all sorts of things that may be contaminated. But it s still a relatively low risk of causing infection.  Tierno said.He emphasized that for most people. our immune responses and barriers like the skin tend to protect us from infection. even when we re exposed to germs spread from our shoes.  You d have to have it break through the skin for there to be an intrusion of many of the germs.  Tierno added.  And even if you get microorganisms on you. you d have to pick up a lot of cells in sufficient number to cause an infection. You could step upon organisms that are dangerous. but in general. I characterize it as low risk. Even if your risk of getting sick is low. you probably aren t keen on the idea of mingling your clothes with your germy shoes in all their microscopic spit-. urine-. vomit- and fecal matter-covered glory. Sometimes. family members co-pack the same suitcases when they re traveling together or share the same luggage that they ll alternate using for separate trips. And while your suitcase might have a separate outer compartment where you can put shoes. odds are you need to utilize the inside of the bag as well. That s where shoe bags come in. From washable packing cubes to colorful drawstring sacks. there s no shortage of options to contain your footwear.If you re looking to invest in some shoe bags before your next long flight. we ve rounded up options below.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For much of the past two years. America has been first in line for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Now. as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies. the White House is warning that if Congress doesn t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.Already the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy. even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.have all placed ordersMonths ago. the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called  urgent  needs in both the U.S. and abroad.The Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.The White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid. which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.Paxlovid. when administered within five days of symptoms appearing. has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus. down from more than 2.600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.The U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. through what was known in the Trump administration as  Operation Warp Speed. Now. with a new generation of treatments on the horizon. the U.S. is falling behind.Japan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill. which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.Because of the funding delays. officials say. the U.S. has yet to place an advance order. which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill. We know companies are working on additional. promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people. and without additional funding from Congress. we risk losing out on accessing these treatments. as well as tests and vaccines. while other countries get in front of us in line.  said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz.  Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome. Complicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce. and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long. meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.Last month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.Administration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.The funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.Moderna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call  bivalent  shots — a mix of each company s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.The Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5. once they are approved by regulators. and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50. it doesn t have the money to order the new generation of doses.Earlier this month. former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan. Vietnam. the Philippines. and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.Republicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate. the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order. which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border. is set to be lifted on May 23.An election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats. and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules  termination. but Republicans could well force a vote anyway. Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y.. said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress. but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.There are at least six Democrats. and potentially 10 or more. who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order. enough to secure its passage.Such a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts. who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.Republicans haven t said what language they would embrace. but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford. R-Okla.. and Kyrsten Sinema. D-Ariz.It would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.___AP writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.,Health News

OLKILUOTO ISLAND. Finland ― From the outside. it looks like any other modern Nordic building rising several stories from a cleared swath of pine forest on this quiet. rural island off this country s verdant southwest coast.But inside. hard-hatted workers are busy completing a feat of engineering that has never existed. It involves a robotic system and a basement network of switchbacking tunnels carved more than 1.300 feet into the Earth s crust. Once finished. the project. called Onkalo. will turn the page to a new chapter of nuclear energy s turbulent 80-year story and make history for the power plant just a two-minute drive down the road.In a matter of months. the machines inside this boxy gray building will begin a weekly routine that will continue for a century: placing highly radioactive gray cuboid rods into copper cylinders the length of a Lincoln Town Car. From there. the canisters will travel roughly two hours underground to crypts meant to keep the spent-fuel rods undisturbed for millennia in bedrock that geologists say hasn t shifted in almost 2 billion years. Sealed twice over in bentonite clay ― which expands when wet. preventing water from seeping in and corroding the capsules. and offers stability in case of an earthquake ― this site is meant to entomb nuclear waste for as close to eternity as any human endeavor can guarantee.The project will store waste from the decades-old nuclear power complex next door. Last month. Finland switched on Olkiluoto-3. the third and biggest generator at the power station here. The reactor. one of the largest ever built and the first to open in Western Europe in at least 15 years. will produce about 14% of Finland s electricity. Combined with the plant s other two reactors. this speck of an island will provide 36% of the country s power.On its own. the new reactor would be notable as a rare bullish bet on atomic power at a time when. despite the world s attempts to slash climate-changing emissions and wean Europe off the fossil fuels financing Russia s war machine. more countries have closed nuclear plants than have opened new ones. But Onkalo makes this the world s first nuclear power plant that solves the problem of the toxic waste that has for years rendered humanity s most reliable and efficient energy source politically radioactive across much of the globe. This is a message from Finland that we have a solution to make nuclear power sustainable.  said Janne Mokka. the chief executive of Posiva Oy. the company building the storage site.  This gives certainty on what is the question of final disposal. It has never been done. Yet it has been tried. The United States proposed building a permanent storage site in the Nevada desert at Yucca Mountain but canceled the project a decade later under pressure from Nevada politicians and Native Americans. France is digging its own facility. where it will store waste in clay. Sweden is working on an underground repository that mirrors Finland s approach. Canada is also considering possible sites for its own.Nuclear energy has remained controversial across the rich world. even though it s one of the safest forms of electricity generation. especially compared with fossil fuels that not only cause climate change but also lace the air with deadly disease-causing particles. Reactors are by far the most reliable source of electricity in existence. producing tremendous volumes of power 24/7 from relatively tiny nuggets of mined uranium. unlike solar panels and wind turbines that require vast operations and huge amounts of metal. and can prove less reliable in cloudy. windless weather. But nuclear power has very high upfront costs and the building process is slow. It s also politically unpopular. in no small part because of the threat posed by radioactive waste.The United Nations  International Atomic Energy Agency hailed Onkalo as a  game changer  for the nuclear industry when its officials toured the construction site in November 2020. Replicating the storage facility could prove tricky. particularly in the U.S.. and some in the industry wonder if permanent burial is in fact the best answer to waste that still contains vast quantities of usable energy.But Finland is hoping to show the world how to preserve our climate and modern industrial society for future generations without saddling them with waste that remains dangerous for as many years as have passed since mammoths and early humans roamed the Ice Age tundra.More than a quarter-million tons of nuclear waste sits stored at power plants across the world.The U.S. alone has produced more than 85.000 metric tons of spent fuel since the 1950s. That may sound like a lot. but nuclear waste is heavy. and even that total is compact enough to fit on a single football field. Hardly the green glowing goo seen in cartoons. spent fuel comes out in hollow bundles of zirconium-alloy rods filled with gummy bear-sized pellets of enriched uranium. The country s 93 remaining reactors. which generate just less than one-fifth of U.S. electricity. produce waste at a rate of about 2.000 tons per year. Spent fuel is stored across the country at about 80 sites. mostly at the same facilities as the reactors that produced the waste. either in container pools where rods are kept cool or in dry casks.A typical large reactor produces about 25 metric tons of high-level radioactive spent fuel per year. Finland has five large reactors.Nuclear reactors produce energy by splitting atoms of uranium in a process known as fission. where a neutron collides with an atom. splits it and releases huge volumes of energy in the form of heat and radiation. In a power plant. that heat is harnessed to turn water into steam. which spins turbines that generate electricity. Radiation is all around us all the time. It s just energy moving through space. and it takes many forms. including ultraviolet light and radio transmission signals. Its effect on human health is measured by a metric called sieverts. One millisievert ― one-thousandth of a sievert ― is harmless. A banana contains 0.01 millisieverts. Uranium miners and nuclear plant workers receive an average annual dose of about 2 millisieverts. according to the World Nuclear Association data. A flight crew routinely taking the polar route from New York City to Tokyo takes in about 9 millisieverts per year. A single pelvic CT scan generally equates to a 10 millisievert dose. After exposure to 100 millisieverts. your chances of getting cancer may go up slightly.A single dose of 1.000 millisieverts is enough to induce nausea. vomiting and hemorrhaging. At least half the people in a group exposed to 5.000 millisieverts at once will die within a month. A short-term dose of 10.000 millisieverts is a death sentence within weeks. . dataA decade after it s removed from a reactor. nuclear waste can produce a dose of radiation of about 100.000 millisieverts per hour. But radiation decreases in half-lives over time. After about 1.000 years. waste decays back to the radioactive levels of its original mined ore. but keeping it isolated from the environment around it remains important to avoid irradiating plants and animals in the food chain. Onkalo is being built to last 100.000 years.Such timescales give any reasonable person pause.But nuclear power occupies a uniquely fear-inducing place in popular culture. goaded by images that range from the recklessly buffoonish nuclear plant operator Homer Simpson on  The Simpsons  — as well as his misanthropic boss. Mr. Burns — and scenes of skin-blistering agony in HBO s  Chernobyl. Ash from a coal-burning power plant. which contains radioactive materials and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury that. unlike uranium. remain steadily toxic forever. spews 100 times more radiation into the surrounding area than a nuclear plant producing the same amount of energy. Radioactive minerals dredged up during gas drilling now contaminate communities across the U.S. The fine particles that burning fossil fuels spew into the air. meanwhile. caused 1 in 5 premature deaths worldwide in 2018 alone. according to a landmark Harvard University study. and increased the rates of diseases ranging from erectile dysfunction to dementia.Just 49% of U.S. adults said they favor nuclear power in a 2019 Gallup poll. down from a high of 62% in 2010. Overwhelming majorities of self-identified Democrats. women and those without college degrees opposed nuclear power. More Republicans than Democrats supported expanding nuclear power in a Pew Research Center survey from January. A plurality of U.S. adults. 35%. favored encouraging production of nuclear power. while 26% wanted the energy source discouraged and 37% said it should be neither encouraged nor discouraged. That made nuclear power slightly more popular than oil and gas drilling but far less supported than renewable energy production.That could also be a symptom of what the polling firm Bisconti Research. which frequently looks at public attitudes on atomic energy and has routinely found more favorable opinions than other surveys. calls a  perception gap  in which a majority of Americans judge public opinion of nuclear power to be less favorable than their own.In Finland. by contrast. about half the population of nearly 5.6 million supports expanding nuclear power while a quarter say the current level is appropriate. according to a 2021 poll from Finnish Energy ― a survey that. while conducted by an industry trade group. is widely trusted because it s been ongoing for decades with the same questions. Just 18% of respondents supported reducing the current levels of nuclear power. down from more than 40% in previous decades. Traditionally. Finns have been pretty pro-nuclear. and it s a pro-technology. pro-engineering country.  said Tea Törmänen. a biologist and the executive director of the Finnish climate group RePlanet.  My guess is because the environmental conditions in Finland have always been so harsh. so we ve had to rely on inventions. innovations and technology to survive. She s a member of the Green Party. which historically. in most Western countries. serves as a bastion of anti-nuclear advocacy. But even the Finnish chapter of Greenpeace. another vehemently anti-nuclear group in most nations. largely supports nuclear power.Building a permanent waste site has long enjoyed strong support among nuclear skeptics. Törmänen said. When the final repository was decided on. the Greens. even though at the time they were opposing nuclear in general. they weren t opposing the solution to the waste.  Törmänen said.  They thought. ‘We have these nuclear plants. we must deal with the waste responsibly.  So there s this allowance to be practical. When Onkalo was first proposed. each municipality under consideration in Finland was consulted and given veto power. The small farming and fishing community that traditionally existed on Olkiluoto Island ultimately accepted the project. which it saw as a boon for tax revenue and jobs. Part of the benefit is that the island already hosted a nuclear power plant with dozens of employees. so most people in the area knew someone who worked there.In Rauma. the charming medieval town just a 20-minute drive south from Olkiluoto Island. residents walking the cobblestone streets late one afternoon seemed largely unconcerned about the new nuclear reactor and storage site less than 10 miles away.  It s quite a safe place. and the regulations are there for a reason.  said Mikko Ammer. 39. a security worker at the nuclear plant.  If it s done properly. it s safe. And Onkalo is a huge part of that. Nuclear power is  difficult  because of the waste it creates. said Aino Yrjölä. 17.  But maybe this solves the problem for the next generation.  she said of Onkalo.Leena Kiviranta. who said she was in her 30s. had more immediate concerns as she picked up a flattened cardboard milk carton from the ground.  I m not worried about it at all.  she said of the nuclear projects.  I d rather keep my energy on the sun and the spring. and I hope people would just be more natural and stop putting garbage on the street. Those attitudes stand in stark contrast to the U.S. attempt to build a permanent storage site at Nevada s Yucca Mountain. Federal officials selected the site in the desert roughly 150 miles northwest of Las Vegas against the protests of the Western Shoshone Nation. who complained that the facility. located on land used for decades as a nuclear testing site. was on their treaty territory. Farmers in the Amargosa Valley also raised concerns that the waste could leach into the water table and contaminate crops. Dealing with nuclear waste  takes political will. and that s not something we have in abundance in our country right now.  said Gerald Frankel. a material scientist at Ohio State University who has long worked on the issue of waste disposal.In Nordic countries. including Finland and Sweden. he said.  what they have done is to embed people in the community and address concerns. The approach is to have consent-based siting and have community brought into the process. That s not the way we have approached it in this country. The sheer size of the U.S. raises the additional problem that waste would need to be transported across vast distances. raising the risk of an accident or terrorist attack along the way. But putting aside the lack of political will for even a single site. Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the sole location the U.S. could consider for first permanent storage in 1988. creating a legal logjam that prevents federal authorities from pursuing other options without changing the law. After the Obama administration halted Yucca Mountain. a federal commission convened to assess the country s nuclear future recommended that the Department of Energy pursue a  consent-based  effort to find a new location for a repository. But so far it hasn t done much. And in 2017. the Government Accountability Office issued a report finding that resuming the Yucca Mountain project would be difficult. We re basically in limbo.  Frankel said.Even as climate change and geopolitics broaden the appeal of nuclear plants. the energy source still struggles with high costs and long delays. This is in part the result of the industry s hollowing-out over the past few decades. meaning the workforce and skilled knowledge on how to build highly technical and tightly regulated structures have shrunk. especially compared with Russia and China. where large plants continue to be built regularly.The lone nuclear reactor under construction in the U.S.. Southern Co. s Plant Vogtle in Georgia. hit even more delays in February. sending total costs surging past $30 billion and postponing electricity production until at least 2023. In the United Kingdom. the company building the only major reactor under construction. Hinkley Point C. also announced delays and cost increases.If new nuclear plants have a future in the U.S. and the Western world. it s most likely as small. modular reactors. The technology already exists ― small reactors power military boats and submarines ― but a handful of startups in the U.S.. Canada and the United Kingdom are working on licensing commercial versions of the machines to serve as power plants. The projects are at various stages of completion and licensing. But as they come closer to commercial viability. a point analysts predict they will reach around 2030. they face a problem: Where to get fuel.Since the 1990s. Russia has been the primary source of enriched uranium for reactor fuel in the U.S.. the result of a deal the Clinton administration made to boost the former U.S. rival s economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unlike France. which produces the vast majority of its electricity from nuclear power and recycles a sizable portion of its waste. the U.S. does not reuse its spent fuel. (Finland and Sweden opted out of recycling in the 1970s because it was seen as too expensive and they had no use for the plutonium. a byproduct that can come from reenrichment. which is usually produced for nuclear weapons.)But small-reactor startups that want to sell their machines to. for example. the U.S. military to use on remote bases need to use what is called  unobligated uranium  ― essentially fuel that comes from domestic sources. Plans to build a new enrichment facility in Idaho fell through as cheap Russian uranium made the project too costly.Yet now. companies such as California-based Oklo Inc. are eyeing new ways to recycle spent fuel. which still retains up to 95% of its energy content even after it s used.If that bet pays off. it makes investments in permanent storage sites underground less appealing. said Chris Gadomski. the lead nuclear analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF. There s a lot of discussion about recycling that fuel and burning it in advanced reactors … so my thinking on it is burying the fuel with all this energy content doesn t make any sense at all. you might as well try to find a reactor that can burn it.  he said.  Why deposit an asset that has this much energy still available? But reprocessing uranium produces plutonium. the even more deadly compound used in nuclear weapons. Increasing recycling. therefore. raises risks not only of contamination but also of more proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have a slogan here: from rock to rock.  said Pasi Tuohimaa. Posiva s head of communications.  Geologists would say we have bedrock that s so old. that hasn t moved in all of human history. What could be a safer place on Earth? ,Health News

Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Thursday that a court ruling voiding a federal mandate requiring passengers to mask up on airlines and public transit goes  against public health principles  and sets a  bad precedent. CNNinitially extended the federal mask mandate for travel until May 3 Because our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends. the court declares unlawful and vacates the mask mandate.  she wrote. For a court to come in and interfere in that is really unfortunate.  Fauci said.The CDC still recommends masking and urged the Justice Department to appeal the federal judge s ruling on Wednesday.  It is CDC s continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health.  the agency said.Individual cities can issue their own guidelines for wearing masks in public areas. Los Angeles County issuedreversed its decision just days later The City will move to strongly recommending masks in indoor public spaces as opposed to a mask mandate.

Boston urged people to start wearing masks Thursday and the Biden administration weighed its next legal step in what is shaping up to be a high-stakes court fight over the abrupt end of the national mask mandate on airplanes and mass transit.The Boston Public Health Commission noted a rise in hospitalizations. as well as a 65% increase in cases and an even larger spike in COVID-19 levels in local wastewater samples. It also stressed that the guidance was merely a recommendation. not an order.The country is wrestling with how to deal with the next phase of the pandemic and find the right balance in enacting health measures at a time when many Americans are ready to move on after two exhausting years.threw out a national mask mandateairlines and airports responded swiftlyLos Angeles County bucked national trends and said Thursday it will still require masks on public transit including trains. subways. buses. taxis and rideshares. Cases have risen in the past week and hospitalizations have plateaued after falling the previous two months.abruptly reversed course Thursday night and ended the mandate. map that the CDC switched to in late February Hospitalizations nationally have ticked up in recent weeks but are nowhere near the peak reached at the height of the omicron surge. COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly citywide. so we need people to be vigilant and take precautions that can help us avoid another potential surge.  said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu. the Boston commission s executive director.  Living with COVID-19 is about collective responsibility and working together. She said people in Boston should mask indoors. stay up to date with their vaccinations and test for suspected infections.The Boston recommendation came two days after the city s transit system lifted mask requirements in response to the national transportation ruling. reflecting the mishmash of reactions following the court decision by an appointee of former President Donald Trump.Biden administration figures out an appeal The question the courts are going to have to decide. and the public will have to decide. is when the next health crisis hits — and it will — will we have a strong public health agency to protect the population?  he said.  Or will the CDC simply have its hands tied behind its back? I think it s a very really possibility we re going to see the CDC handcuffed. Supreme Court did strike down the agency s eviction moratorium for housing If someone gets on a flight from New York to LA. there s no state stopping them. The only thing preventing that transmission is the CDC.  Gostin said.Temple University Law Professor Scott Burris echoed that sentiment. saying that the U.S. government s legal authority to respond sensibly to epidemics and other kinds of emergencies is at stake in the case.Burris said the ability to manage future health emergencies  must have weighed heavily  in the reasoning of the Justice Department to appeal the ruling.  but let s not forget we re going into another surge  and there is the potential for new variants.An appeal would go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. which is considered a right-leaning court. and conservative justices have a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling could take away the CDC s power to issue mask orders and cast any future orders under a  legal cloud.  he said.Temple Law s Craig Green said the federal government s strategy is  really almost brilliant  because it could win in two ways with its appeal. If COVID-19 cases numbers continue to fall. Justice Department attorneys could argue that the issue is moot and ask to have the case thrown out. No one will have reason to cite it ever in the future as a precedent.  he said.But he said that if cases rise. the federal government would be better positioned to reimpose a mask mandate. I think the arguments about what a government can do. what the federal level can do under conditions of emergency were very difficult and problematic.  he said.  I can understand why the Department of Justice and the United States government really did not want to see that kind of limit on their authority in the future. even if COVID ends up being more controlled in the future.will lift the bans they imposed We have talked to them individually.  United CEO Scott Kirby told NBC on Thursday.  Many of them assure us that now that the mask mandate is off. everything is going to be fine. and I trust that the vast majority of them will. Many passengers were shrugging off the changes. When Jon Schaudies flies from Chicago to San Antonio next week. he ll wear a mask. but won t worry if the passenger next to him doesn t do the same.Schaudies. who travels frequently as vice president of a small manufacturing company. feels that he has enough protection from the COVID-19 vaccine and booster to avoid becoming seriously ill if he does contract it. I feel like people are at such extremes. but I m sort of right down the middle.  said Schaudies. 51. who plans to get a second booster shot.He understands the worries of parents traveling with children who are too young to be vaccinated. but says  they have decision to make  about whether to fly.  But for business travelers. we can t stop.  The world has to go on at some point. ____Hollingsworth reported from Mission. Kansas. and Whitehurst from Salt Lake City. Associated Press writer Carla K.

A U.K. patient with a severely weakened immune system had COVID-19 for almost a year and a half. scientists reported. underscoring the importance of protecting vulnerable people from the coronavirus.There s no way to know for sure whether it was the longest-lasting COVID-19 infection because not everyone gets tested. especially on a regular basis like this case.But at 505 days.  it certainly seems to be the longest reported infection.  said Dr. Luke Blagdon Snell. an infectious disease expert at the Guy s & St. Thomas  NHS Foundation Trust.infectious diseases meeting in PortugalTheir study investigated which mutations arise — and whether variants evolve — in people with super long infections. It involved nine patients who tested positive for the virus for at least eight weeks. All had weakened immune systems from organ transplants. HIV. cancer or treatment for other illnesses. None were identified for privacy reasons.Repeated tests showed their infections lingered for an average of 73 days. Two had the virus for more than a year. Previously. researchers said. the longest-known case that was confirmed with a PCR test lasted 335 days.Persistent COVID-19 is rare and different from long COVID. In long COVID. it s generally assumed the virus has been cleared from your body but the symptoms persist.  Snell said.  With persistent infection. it represents ongoing. active replication of the virus. Each time researchers tested patients. they analyzed the genetic code of the virus to make sure it was the same strain and that people didn t get COVID-19 more than once. Still. genetic sequencing showed that the virus changed over time. mutating as it adapted.The mutations were similar to the ones that later showed up in widespread variants. Snell said. although none of the patients spawned new mutants that became variants of concern. There s also no evidence they spread the virus to others.The person with the longest known infection tested positive in early 2020. was treated with the antiviral drug remdesiver and died sometime in 2021. Researchers declined to name the cause of death and said the person had several other illnesses.Five patients survived. Two cleared the infection without treatment. two cleared it after treatment and one still has COVID-19. At the last follow-up earlier this year. that patient s infection had lasted 412 days.Researchers hope more treatments will be developed to help people with persistent infections beat the virus. We do need to be mindful that there are some people who are more susceptible to these problems like persistent infection and severe disease.  Snell said.Although persistent infections are rare. experts said there are many people with compromised immune systems who remain at risk of severe COVID-19 and who are trying to stay safe after governments lifted restrictions and masks started coming off. And it s not always easy to know who they are. said Dr. Wesley Long. a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. who was not part of the research.

A smaller portion of U.S. children got routine vaccinations required for kindergarten during the pandemic. government researchers said Thursday. raising concerns that measles and other preventable diseases could increase.Rates were close to 94% for measles. whooping cough and chickenpox vaccinations for the 2020-21 school year. That was down 1% from a year earlier and means 35.000 U.S. children entered kindergarten without evidence that they were vaccinated for extremely contagious diseases. the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report.In addition. almost 400.000 fewer children than expected entered kindergarten and their vaccination status is uncertain. the CDC said.Pandemic-related disruptions likely contributed to the decline. the report said. as pediatricians canceled non-emergency appointments. parents skipped checkups for their children and vaccine requirements were eased for students doing remote learning. We haven t seen outbreaks and that s probably representative of the fact that families were staying home during the pandemic.  said Dr. Georgina Peacock. the CDC s director of immunization services. But authorities worry that could change if kids remain behind on their shots as more people return to normal routines.Data for the current school year. due in November. should indicate whether the lag persisted. said the CDC s Shannon Stokley.The data come from schools  reports on vaccination rates in 47 states plus Washington. D.C. The CDC said staffing shortages and other pandemic disruptions could have led to incomplete or absent school reports. a limitation in assessing the true vaccination rates.In 16 states. rates for kids entering kindergarten were at least 95% for measles shots and for the combination diphtheria. tetanus and whooping cough shot. The rates were below 90% for the combined whooping cough shot in eight states plus Washington. D.C.. and in seven states plus Washington. D.C.. for measles shots.For chickenpox vaccinations. 17 states had rates of at least 95% and nine plus Washington. D.C.. had rates below 90%.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Department of Science Education.

Content note: I use the term  obesity  in the title and throughout the piece only for the purpose of describing my career focus before I realized my research was causing harm. This term may seem like neutral medical terminology. but for many. it is stigmatizing.I was an  obesity  researcher for nearly two decades. and in that time. I helped design and test numerous weight-loss programs. Like other travelers along my career path. I had good intentions from the start. I genuinely believed I was helping people by supporting them to lose weight. But I was wrong.diet culture I I thought more knowledge about nutrition was the key to controlling my own weight and that I could help others along the way. This choice ultimately morphed into a career in research. where I focused on investigating how to  solve  chronic disease with weight loss. But even in my tightly controlled studies. with ample resources and daily support. most of the participants achieved minimal weight loss and gained the weight back once the study ended.10-20% of study participantsdetermined by geneticsAfter much internal reflection. I realized I had an eating disorder. stemming all the way back to my childhood. I also realized that my eating disorder was what drove many of my career decisions and beliefs about weight and health.After receiving treatment in my late 30s. I saw my career studying  obesity  in a new light: My work was perpetuating harmful practices and stereotypes. and I couldn t be a part of that anymore. I switched my focus to researching eating disorders. how they present themselves and impact diverse people. and what we can do to treat them more effectively.Along this journey. I learned a few key things I think are important for organizations. physicians. researchers and the general population to understand.There are no  good foods  or  bad foods. gateway to disordered eatingFood insecurity is highly correlated with eating disordersWeight is not intrinsically tied to health.increasedavoid seeking health careIt s never too late to unlearn harmful ideas.I held my beliefs about weight. food and health for decades — both personally and professionally. It s easy to think that once you hold a core idea for so long. and even build a career out of it. it can be impossible to change your perspective. What helped me unlearn these beliefs was the recognition that I was encouraging harmful behaviors that often show up in people with eating disorders. The only difference is that we think these behaviors are helpful for those in large bodies and harmful for those in thin bodies. The truth is. these behaviors are harmful for everyone. My journey hasn t been an easy one. but I have gained so much as a result. I gained weight. as my body needed more nourishment. I gained freedom from the oppressive beliefs that my worth is tied to my weight. I gained a new passion for researching eating disorders and using what I learn to help others.I also gained better mental health. greater connection with my family and friends. and a firm belief that we must dismantle our culture s harmful ideas about weight and health so our next generation of children can grow up believing their bodies don t need to be changed in order for them to have value.Dr. Dori Steinberg is a researcher. registered dietitian and advocate for eating disorder prevention.

At the urging of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. the Department of Justice on Wednesday filed a notice of appeal to a federal judge s ruling that overturned the federal mask mandates on airplanes and other modes of public transportation that had been designed to protect against the spread of COVID-19.statement  It is CDC s continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health.  the agency said in a statement. adding that it believes it is  well within CDC s legal authority to protect public health. On Tuesday. the Justice Department said it was prepared to proceed with an appeal on May 3 ― the date the mask order was scheduled to expire until a Florida judge interfered ― if the CDC believed the mask ordinance should continue. But the CDC made it clear Wednesday that the proposed timeline would not be sufficient. especially amid the emergence of the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus. which scientists are still studying.  As we have said before. wearing masks is most beneficial in crowded or poorly ventilated locations. such as the transportation corridor.  the agency said in its statement. Requiring people to wear a mask in such settings helps  protect themselves. and those around them. including those who are immunocompromised or not yet vaccine-eligible. and help keep travel and public transportation safer for everyone.  the CDC added.decision to lift the federal mask mandateDonald TrumpliftedUber,Health News
dentistsAnd so does at least one Illinois man who has recovered after an ill-timed cough during a routine tooth filling deposited a nearly inch-long drill bit deep in the lower right lobe of his lung.told Wisconsin TV station WISNThe bit embedded itself so deeply in Jozsi s lung that conventional tools couldn t reach it. forcing interventional pulmonologist Dr. Abdul Alraiyes to take a more creative approach.Wielding a tiny robotic bronchoscope typically reserved for sampling suspicious tissue deep in the lung. Alraiyes was able to ever-so-carefully extract the bit. The operation. carried out at the Aurora Medical Center in Kenosha. Wisconsin. was a success.to Alraiyes  YouTube channel I was never so happy as when I opened my eyes. and I saw him with a smile under that mask shaking a little plastic container with the tool in it.  said Jozsi.Frightening though the story may be. there s no reason it should dissuade you from visiting the dentist.Dr. Edmond Hewlett. a consumer adviser for the American Dental Association and longtime professor at the UCLA School of Dentistry. told HuffPost that dentists are trained to anticipate items coming loose in the mouth.Those items typically include a piece of decayed tooth or even an ill-fitting crown. They re readily captured by what are called rubber dams ― thin sheets of rubber that act as a barrier to the rest of the mouth (and the throat) — and are then extracted via either suction or a small pair of forceps. It happens not infrequently.  Hewlett said.  And we re ready for it. As for a drill bit coming loose and then being inhaled. Hewlett acknowledged that any medical procedure carries some inherent risk. In this instance. he said. it seems to have been exacerbated by  an unfortunate simultaneous cough. (If you need to cough or clear your throat during dental work. it wouldn t hurt to tell your dentist before doing so.)Industry data about how often something like this occurs doesn t really exist. Hewlett said. But he pointed to a 2004 study in the Journal of Dental Education that found that. over a 10-year period involving 100.000 patient visits at a large dental education institute. there were 36 reported instances of a small dental item being swallowed or aspirated.Of those cases. 25 were swallowed. one was inhaled. and 10 were reported lost and never located in the patient. These are dental students who are learning dentistry.  Hewlett said of the study s scope.  We don t let them treat patients until they ve developed important competencies. but still. these are trainees. Hewlett encouraged anyone who s apprehensive about a procedure to speak with their dentist beforehand and ask questions about anything that isn t clear. During these common procedures.  said Hewlett.  understand that the techniques and the devices and the technology we use are extremely effective in preventing the type of incident that happened with the patient in Wisconsin. ,Health News
The Biden administration says Arizona appears  unable or unwilling  to keep workers safe on the job and is taking steps to crack down on the state s lax standards.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Wednesday that it s moving to revoke Arizona s state OSHA plan. The Grand Canyon State is one of more than 20 states that run their own workplace safety programs under federal approval. with inspections carried out by state officials. Under the law. a state plan must be  at least as effective  as the federal program. If it s found not to be. then federal officials could move to take over enforcement.Doug Parker. the head of OSHA appointed by President Joe Biden. said on a press call that Arizona had shown a pattern of ignoring federal requirements. including a new rule to protect health care workers from COVID-19. State plans were obligated to implement their own version of that rule. and Arizona was one of three states that OSHA officials warned when they hadn t done so.But Parker said problems with Arizona go back years. OSHA is asking Arizona ... to address the litany of issues that OSHA has identified over the last decade.  he said.  This isn t about a single instance. It s about multiple issues over a period of time. A spokesperson for the state s OSHA program. known as the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health. could not immediately be reached on Wednesday.Parker cautioned that revoking a state plan s approval is a lengthy process and that it could be avoided with changes by Arizona. The process began Wednesday with a notice in the federal register that OSHA intended to move forward with axing the state program. That would be followed by a public-comment period.The move made Wednesday does not give federal officials the authority to start enforcing workplace safety standards in Arizona. at least not yet. Parker said if federal officials ended up revoking the plan then they would address enforcement at that time.As Jordan Barab. a workplace safety expert and former OSHA official. has explained on his blog Confined Space. revoking a state plan is a last resort in dealing with recalcitrant states. and it comes with several downsides. In states with their own safety plans. the federal and state governments split the cost of administering them. If federal OSHA has to take over enforcement in Arizona. that could siphon resources from an already-stretched agency. The move would also end up excluding Arizona s public employees from OSHA coverage. meaning OSHA s safety rules wouldn t apply in their workplaces.Arizona. along with South Carolina and Utah. was slow to adopt the Biden administration s COVID-19 safety rule for health care facilities. When OSHA put the states on notice in October. an Arizona official told HuffPost that the state was working  in good faith  to implement it and was  surprised  by the threat from federal officials.Doug Ducey. the state s Republican governor who has been resistant to pandemic safety measures. called it  a political stunt and desperate power grab. But federal officials said Arizona had failed to adopt other federal standards in a timely manner. According to OSHA. Arizona has not adopted fine levels that meet the federal law s requirements. or developed a series of safety emphasis programs that OSHA requires. Officials also said Arizona didn t strengthen its rules for protecting workers from falls until after OSHA said it might revoke the state plan.,Health News

Amy Schumerher real-life struggle with trichotillomaniainterview on  The Howard Stern Show  When I was 13 I pulled out so much hair that I needed to get a wig and wear a wig to school.  Schumer said. She called the experience  humiliating  and said it left her feeling  ugly and unlovable  as she had  big bald spots.  Despite grappling with the condition. the actor said she didn t really understand the core of the problem.  I thought I was OK. I didn t realize that I was not OK and the hair pulling was a symptom of that.  the  Life & Beth  star explained.  I would not even realize I did it and just look down and there would be a pile of hair.  Schumer said both of her parents were concerned about the condition and her mother  was especially just horrified by and upset by it.   She would help me do my hair before school every morning. and she would be crying while she helped me with my hair.  the actor added. as she began to get emotional.  It s been my big secret. you know.  Schumer continued.  I have so much shame about it. I really just wanted to try to let go of it and accept it about myself. and this was part of that.

LOUISVILLE. Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky jury has awarded a man $450.000 who sued his employer after he asked them not to celebrate his birthday at work — and they did it anyway.Kevin Berling told his manager at Gravity Diagnostics in Covington in 2019 that a birthday celebration would cause him immense stress.Courier Journal reported.Berling alleged in his lawsuit the company discriminated against him based on a disability and retaliated against him for demanding a reasonable accommodation to it.The jury returned the verdict after a two-day trial in Kenton County that ended in late March. The jury awarded him $300.000 for emotional distress and $150.000 in lost wages.An attorney for the company. Katherine Kennedy. said it continues to deny liability and is pursuing its post-trial options.Julie Brazil. the company s founder and chief operating officer. said in an email statement to the newspaper that  with ever-increasing incidents of workplace violence. this verdict sets a very dangerous precedent for employers and most importantly employees that unless physical violence actually occurs. workplace violence is acceptable. Brazil said that her employees. rather than the plaintiff. were the victims in the case.Berling s attorney. Tony Bucher. said once the jury got to meet his client. they realized the company s claim that he posed a threat was far-fetched.Berling had told his supervisor that a birthday celebration would bring back bad childhood memories surrounding his parents  divorce. The supervisor forgot to pass along his request. the company said.,Health News

says on its websiteaccording to The New York TimesThe WHO reportedly puts the real number at around 15 million people. but it has yet to release those figures.India s objections to the way those new numbers were calculated has delayed the release for months. the Times reported Saturday. citing more than 10 people familiar with the data.The WHO s new estimate tells a far deadlier story about how the pandemic affected India. which experienced a massive wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths last spring. At least 4 million Indians died of COVID-19. the WHO reportedly believes. far outstripping the country s official count of 520.000 deaths.The new numbers would make India the nation with the most COVID-19 deaths. Researchers combined reported deaths with household surveys. updated local information and statistical models. the Times said. Their results were supposed to be released in January. providing key information on understanding the pandemic. so that authorities may try to prevent the next one. The WHO told the Times it expects to release the figures this month.Many countries. including the United States. have had difficulty accurately tallying the number of COVID-19 dead due to insufficient testing. political factors and other reasons.Read more at The New York Times.,Health News
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first breathalyzer test to detect COVID-19. On Thursday. the FDA announced that it was issuing an emergency use authorization for the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer. which detects coronavirus infections through breath samples. The test can provide results in under three minutes. So far. widely available COVID-19 tests are administered by swabbing inside people s nostrils with a Q-tip and then testing the sample. with results taking anywhere from a few minutes for a rapid test to days for a PCR test. Today s authorization is yet another example of the rapid innovation occurring with diagnostic tests for COVID-19.  Jeff Shuren. director of the FDA s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. said in a release from the agency. He noted that this innovation could help with the current pandemic and  better position the U.S. for the next public health emergency.  In a study of over 2.000 people. the test was found to have 91.2% sensitivity (the rate of COVID-positive samples correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the rate of negative samples correctly identified). Clinical trials started in 2020. but the device was also tested specifically on the omicron variant. the FDA said.Health care providers can use the test. which is about the size of carry-on luggage. on patients in doctor s offices. hospitals and mobile testing sites. according to the FDA.As the highly contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant of the coronavirus has been spreading in the U.S.. cases nationwide have begun to tick back up. Case levels are still currently far lower than they were during the major winter spike. Vaccination remains the best method of protection against hospitalization and death from the virus. ,Health News

Pfizer COVID-19 U.S. health authorities already urge everyone 12 and older to get one booster dose for the best protection against the newest variants ― and recently gave the option of a second booster to those 50 and older.Now Pfizer says new data shows healthy 5- to 11-year-olds could benefit from another kid-sized shot.In a small study. 140 youngsters who d already gotten two shots were given a booster six months later. and researchers found the extra shot generally revved up their immune response. But a closer look at 30 of the children found a 36-fold increase in virus-fighting antibodies. levels high enough to fight the super-contagious omicron variant. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said in a press release.The data has not been published or vetted by independent experts.Pfizer tested the kid booster while omicron was surging this winter. While COVID-19 cases now are at much lower levels in the U.S.. in recent weeks an even more contagious version of omicron. called BA.2. has become the dominant type locally and around the world.In the coming days. the companies plan to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a booster for healthy 5- to 11-year-olds. They also plan to share the data with European and other regulators.Vaccinations are generally less effective against the omicron variant than earlier versions of the coronavirus ― but they do still offer strong protection against severe disease. While COVID-19 is a bigger threat to adults. youngsters can get seriously ill. But regulators will have to decide if healthy elementary-age kids really need a booster. and if so. when.The Pfizer shots are the only vaccine available to U.S. children. Those ages 5 to 11 receive one-third of the dose given to everyone 12 and older. Just over a quarter in the younger age group have gotten two doses since vaccination opened to them in November. shortly before omicron struck.The U.S. hasn t yet allowed vaccinations for children under 5. But certain 5- to 11-year-olds ― those with severely weakened immune systems ― already are supposed to get three doses. to give that high-risk group a better chance of responding.,Health News
I always worried about my daughter. Would she grow up feeling happy in her body? I vowed that she would learn that brains were more valuable than boobs and humor is more attractive than hair. I tried to weave these sentiments into our conversations over the years. and although I m not ready to declare victory yet (she s only 14). I think she s gotten the message. But what about my son? Unexpectedly. it s actually his body image I find myself worrying about. Is he happy in his body? Even more concerning: Would I know if he weren t?I am a health psychologist. professor and body image scientist. And yet. when I recently tried to engage my son in a conversation about body image. he was reluctant to talk. It was actually more than that — it was as though he didn t have the words to talk about his body. Across 25 years of conducting research on body image. I ve found that my personal experience is reflected by many. I interviewed dozens of boys ages 14 to 24 for my forthcoming book  Being You: The Body Image Book for Boys.  and conversations often started slowly and awkwardly (a real contrast to my experience interviewing girls for my other books). Boys could tell me they wanted bigger abs and pecs. and thought they should eat a ton of protein. but were often at a loss to articulate why. One boy recounted taping his chest before heading to school one day because he was tired of his friends teasing him about his  man titties.  Scotch tape was not up to the task and created an embarrassing mess for him to extract himself from when he got home that afternoon. The more I spoke with boys. the more it became clear to me that they couldn t win. It s nearly impossible for them to be tall. lean and muscular like the guys they see on TikTok bragging about their gym routines. Those bodies require a certain genetic predisposition and an unhealthy attention to diet and lifting weights.One boy told me.  Any moment where my shirt was off in public just caused me to feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. It was clear from their actions — whether it be weightlifting. carb-cutting. grooming or dressing ― that boys care and worry about their appearances. And yet. boys didn t think of their appearance concerns as body image issues.Boys (and many of us adults. too) tend to think body dissatisfaction only plagues girls. But research suggests otherwise. One recent study found that 75% of adolescent boys are dissatisfied with their bodies. Up tohalf of boys are using supplements such as protein powders during their teens thinking it will boost their muscularity. (It won t.) A growing portion ― one-fourth to one-third ― of eating disorder patients are male. Clearly boys are suffering. but they seem to mostly be suffering in silence. In addition to interviewing teen boys for  Being You.  I spoke to young men with a history of eating disorders. I heard them confirm what recent research suggests: Boys  eating disorders are often not identified until their condition is dire. This is. in part. because boys who develop eating disorders don t necessarily have the same symptoms as girls. Boys may  purge  with excessive exercise. they are more likely to eat but eliminate entire food groups from their diets. Their preoccupation and psychological distress is present but not discussed. All too often. boys  parents. peers. coaches and sometimes even medical providers believed boys were  getting healthy.  when in fact they were sinking into a serious disorder. As one boy told me.  It didn t take long before all that exercise and my ‘healthy  eating resulted in notable weight loss. I also found myself becoming obsessed with food. I was always thinking about what I was eating ― and not eating ― next.  Dr. Jason Nagata. an expert in boys  body image and eating disorders at the University of California. San Francisco. is one of a growing number of scientists and advocates helping to shed light on boys  vulnerabilities and signs to watch for. He told me:  Boys with eating disorders may pursue a body ideal that is big and muscular. They may engage in muscle-enhancing behaviors such as excessive exercise and use of performance-enhancing substances.  Of course. some boys want to lose weight. and many want to lose weight and bulk up. which has led to new language and techniques — bulking. cutting and shredding — flourishing online. The scientific basis for these practices is questionable at best and the possibility of them leading to disordered eating habits is likely.What makes the situation worse is that boys are less likely than girls to seek help for mental health issues. Nagata emphasizes that the longer food and body image concerns go unaddressed. the more habitual they can become. And. the long-term consequences of an eating disorder can be extremely serious and life-threatening. physical. social and cognitive development can be affected. When I started writing  Being You.  I wanted to develop a resource for my son and tween and teen boys everywhere. but I wasn t convinced that boys  experiences were as complex or serious as girls  experiences. I ve changed my mind. Boys  experiences of their bodies are different from girls  but just as challenging. They are also bombarded with messages that they need to  fix  their bodies. but aren t socialized to understand how to get help when they need it. They may be unlikely to find themselves squeezing into a bikini. but they still don t want to take their shirts off at the pool. Until we normalize conversations about body image among boys. they ll stay stuck in a parallel universe to what girls and women have known for decades.Recently. my son went to the gym with a friend to lift weights for the first time. I asked him when he got home if he thought he d do this regularly. He said.  Nah. I really don t think so. Don t worry. I m happy with myself as I am. Body positive. Mom!  I guess maybe he s been listening all along. Dr. Charlotte H.

Workers at a Home Depot in Philadelphia voted decisively against unionizing in an election held this week. turning back an effort to form the home-improvement chain s first organized store.A ballot count held Saturday by the National Labor Relations Board showed the upstart union. Home Depot Workers United. . The board has not certified the results yet. and the union has a week to file any challenges.Home Depot does not have a union at any of its 2.000 U.S. stores. although some of the company s drivers in California are represented by the Teamsters. The company opposed the organizing effort in Philadelphia and flooded the store with managers in an apparent effort to weaken any union support. The chain told HuffPost before the vote count that  we respect the right to unionize. we just don t believe it s the best solution for our associates. The union effort was led by Vince Quiles. a 26-year-old worker in the store s receiving department. Quiles gathered signed union cards from nearly 40% of the store s workforce in order to get the election scheduled (the board requires signatures from at least 30% of the would-be bargaining unit).In an interview with HuffPost after he filed for the election. Quiles said the store s employees were overworked and underpaid. and that working through the pandemic had made him feel like a union was necessary. People come in and bust their ass. They work really hard.  Quiles had said.  Whatever happens. [Home Depot is] going to take us seriously and they re going to respect the people in that building more. U.S. employers have seen a surge in workplace organizing recently. Workers filed more union election petitions this past fiscal year than in any other since 2016. They have succeeded in creating the first unions at a host of big-name employers. including Amazon. Starbucks. Trader Joe s. Apple. REI and Chipotle.Like at some of those other companies. the Home Depot union effort was a new. independent campaign. unaffiliated with an established labor group like the Teamsters. Such campaigns come with certain advantages. but they lack the resources and organizing staff that traditional unions bring to the table. The independent Amazon Labor Union won a historic vote at the tech giant s Staten Island warehouse earlier this year. and later lost two elections at smaller facilities. The new union Trader Joe s United won its first two elections — one in Hadley. Massachusetts. and another in Minneapolis — and lost a vote at a store in Brooklyn last month.The coffee chain previously did not have a single union at any of its U.S. corporate stores. Those that have joined Workers United are now trying to bargain their first contracts.Quiles said the success of those other campaigns motivated him to try to take on his own employer. We re inspired by Starbucks and Amazon — let us be the catalyst at Home Depot.  he said. ,Health News

Starbucks Workers United. accused the company of being deliberately unclear on whether baristas would still be eligible for the travel reimbursement if their store formed a union. According to Starbucks. travel costs would be covered if an employee couldn t get an abortion within 100 miles of their home. Starbucks purposefully made it so it was confusing whether or not baristas had access to this benefit.  said Casey Moore. a Starbucks worker who handles communications for the union campaign.  People were asking. ‘Do we have it or do we not have it?  Managers didn t have the answer. They were saying conflicting things all over the country. In its June letter to employees. Starbucks said that  even if we were to offer a certain benefit at the bargaining table. a union could decide to exchange it for something else. bitter fightStarbucks has rolled out a slew of new benefits and wage increases but noted that it could not  unilaterally  implement some of them at unionized stores. Under the law. employers can t make certain changes to pay and benefits without consulting the workers  union. But the union. Workers United. has waived its right to bargain over these new benefits. telling Starbucks to go ahead and apply them to unionized cafes. In response. Starbucks says the benefits must be bargained with other proposals.Although Starbucks says health care-related benefits are not being withheld. the union says managers have told workers they could lose the benefits by unionizing.as a threatThe complaint was one of several issued by the board s general counsel accusing Starbucks of withholding or threatening to withhold benefits to punish union supporters and cool other workers on organizing.In their letter Friday. House Democrats said Starbucks was using employee health care as a  weapon.

Federal labor officials filed a complaint Thursday alleging that Chipotle illegally closed a store in Augusta. Maine. in response to an organizing effort by workers. The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board recommended in the filing that Chipotle be ordered to reopen the store and bargain with the union. according to a board spokesperson.Laurie Schalow. Chipotle s chief corporate affairs officer. said in a statement that the closure  had nothing to do with union activity  and that the company plans to  vigorously defend ourselves.  Our operational management reviewed this situation as it would any other restaurant with these unique staffing challenges.  Schalow said.  We respect our employees  rights to organize under the National Labor Relations Act and are committed to ensuring a fair. just. and humane work environment that provides opportunities to all. The burrito chain. which has 3.000 locations in North America. shuttered the Augusta store in July. not long after workers there filed for an election. Workers must round up union cards from at least 30% of a workplace in order for the labor board to schedule a vote.The company said at the time that the closure was due to inadequate staffing. But a lawyer for the workers told The New York Times in July that the move amounted to  Union Busting 101. The general counsel s decision to issue the complaint means investigators looked into the workers  allegations and found merit in them. If Chipotle and the general counsel can t reach a settlement. the matter will be litigated before an administrative law judge and. eventually. perhaps the five-member board in Washington.It s illegal for an employer to close an individual location expressly to snuff out union organizing (although it is legal to shut down an entire business for that reason). The complaint against Chipotle is one of many aggressive moves made under the purview of the NLRB s general counsel. Jennifer Abruzzo. whom President Joe Biden appointed.Abruzzo s office filed a separate complaint earlier this week accusing Starbucks of retaliating against workers by closing a store in Ithaca. New York. That complaint also recommended that Starbucks be compelled to reopen the location. As a practical matter. it is difficult for labor board officials to force a company to reopen a worksite. The complaint typically takes years to litigate. with several opportunities for appeal. and the workers affected often move on with their lives. In addition to reopening the store. the general counsel says Chipotle should have to reinstate the workers who lost their jobs and offer them back pay covering any wages they lost.,Health News
Felix Allen never understood why tracking down an employee who could help him find what he needed at Lowe s was so hard. Then he got a job there. Allen works a merchandiser building product displays for the big-box home improvement chain. Or at least that s what he s supposed to be doing. He said the staff is stretched so thin that he can t go anywhere in his New Orleans store without customers flagging him down for help in other departments. If I m walking past hardware. [a shopper] is gonna show me some archaic screw and ask me. ‘Can you find this for me?   said Allen. 26.  I ll spend 15 minutes trying to find that for them when I should be doing something else. He doesn t blame the customers. Lowe s is putting us in a bad situation.  said Allen. who has worked for the company for roughly two years.  If you re in a hardware store. you should be able to find things. It gets taken out on us a lot.  Anyone who s wandered through the paint section at Lowe s or Home Depot knows how difficult it is to find an available worker for advice. The pandemic certainly didn t help. as home renovations boomed and retailers struggled to retain employees without bidding up wages. The lean staffing has frustrated not only shoppers but the workers who are there to help them.Allen has been trying to form the very first union at Lowe s. a chain with 2.200 locations in the U.S. and Canada. He filed for an election at his store with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) last month. but he and his coworkers later withdrew their petition. Allen said Lowe s  flooded  the store with managers from other locations and corporate headquarters after the union campaign went public. Clearly. if they can bring in that many people on short notice. they have plenty of money to adequately staff our store.  he said.An organizing effort is also underway at a Home Depot in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. where the NLRB will be conducting an election that ends Saturday. Home Depot. which has 2.000 U.S. stores. has no unionized workers at its retail locations. although some of its truck drivers in California are Teamsters members. The Philadelphia campaign is independently run and not affiliated with an established union. Lowe s and Home Depot declined to answer questions about their staffing levels. Lowe s noted in a statement that the union petition had been withdrawn and said the company is  committed to having a positive working environment.  Home Depot said.  We respect the right to unionize. we just don t believe it s the best solution for our associates. Vince Quiles. a 27-year-old leading the Home Depot effort. said the company doesn t want to have any excess labor on the floor at any point  so that you. the employee. stay moving the entire time you re here.  He said the system doesn t offer much slack when an employee calls out sick.  I work in receiving. Say it slows down. and they really need help in plumbing.  Quiles said.  Now. you have to go work in the plumbing department. But you re not paid to do that job. and you don t have the expertise to do that job. When you staff with that mentality. that puts a lot of undue stress on people. tweeted a photo A union isn t going to fix staffing issues. or force the company to change rules we think are essential to our success.  the managers wrote.Many retailers have complained during the pandemic that they can t find enough workers to run full throttle. The unemployment rate is still hovering near a low 3.5%. meaning companies are having to compete for a small pool of available workers. The competition has led to wage gains in the retail sector. but high inflation has just about wiped them out.most recent annual reportThe company said the tight labor market remained a challenge. and warned investors that it may result in  increased salaries. benefits. or other employee-related costs.  In recent months. some retailers have decided they hired too many workers. Both Walmart and Amazon said during earnings calls in May that overstaffing took a bite out of their profits.The turnabout shows how sensitive retailers are to carrying any excess labor relative to sales. and why many prefer to do seasonal hiring for temporary positions.Home Depot employees who support the union effort said it was hard to imagine overstaffing ever being a problem from their point of view. One of Quiles  coworkers. who asked to speak anonymously for fear of retaliation. said their duties had stretched far beyond what their position calls for. It s the overworking with the lack of pay.  the worker said.  I only work in one department. but they have me in four others. I don t get extra pay for that. Another Home Depot employee said the workforce is  being spread too thin.  The worker inevitably spends a lot of time helping shoppers find the correct bolts or fittings. even though customer service isn t technically part of their job. I ve had customers stop me literally when I was one foot in the restroom. the other one out.  the worker said.  They get frustrated with us. They don t understand. There are certain ways a union contract might address such complaints. It s hard for a union to force a company to hire more people. but a collective bargaining agreement might better define roles so that workers don t end up doing other people s jobs. Home Depot said earlier this year that it was trying to speed up job offers to staff up more quickly. The company was trying to add 100.000 workers ahead of the spring and summer – peak time for home renovations – and said some workers would get job offers within a day of applying.  In today s climate. jobseekers are shopping for the best opportunity.  a company vice president said at the time. According to Allen. many of his coworkers at Lowe s don t get scheduled for as much work as they would like. despite the tight labor market. Retail workers have complained for years that their employers prefer to keep a large pool of part-timers rather than boost more people to full-time roles with benefits or have them work overtime. which comes with a time-and-a-half pay premium. Allen said many workers want more time on the clock – they don t want to feel so harried. There s this weird thing where they ll hire a lot of people but then give them barely any hours.  he said.Lowe s and Home Depot have opposed the union campaigns at their stores. saying they value a  direct  relationship with employees and don t believe unionization is in the workers  interest. Home Depot has dispatched outside managers. including from headquarters in Atlanta. to discourage Philadelphia workers from voting for the union. Meanwhile. Allen recently shared videos of Lowe s personnel trying to shoo him out of the store parking lot where he was distributing union literature.  People recognize they re spending a lot of money to bring folks in  to combat the union effort. Allen said.  They could have been using that money to treat us better. ,Health News
Federal labor officials have filed a new and sweeping complaint against Starbucks alleging that the coffee chain retaliated against union workers by shuttering a popular location in Ithaca. New York. among other charges.A regional director for the National Labor Relations Board found merit in the union s claim that the June store closure was meant to dissuade workers from organizing. In the complaint filed at the board on Tuesday. the director said Starbucks  actions were illegal and asked that the company be ordered to reopen the location.The director also accused Starbucks of threatening to withhold benefits and wage increases from workers if they unionized. selectively enforcing work policies against union supporters. disciplining or firing workers who were activists. and failing to bargain in good faith.In addition to reopening the store. the director said Starbucks should have to make workers  whole  for their lost wages and offer reinstatement to five employees. Unless the company and board officials reach a settlement. the allegations will be litigated before an administrative law judge. Starbucks now faces more than 20 complaints at the NLRB. which referees disputes between unions and employers. Officials say the company has repeatedly broken the law by firing pro-union employees. cutting their hours and offering pay hikes and other benefits to those who decline to unionize. Starbucks has denied retaliating against union supporters following other charges from labor board officials. A company spokesperson told HuffPost that Starbucks negotiated with the union over the College Avenue closure and agreed to transfer baristas to other locations at their current pay rates. We routinely review the partner and customer experience in all our stores. and when operations necessitate. we will open or close a store in the regular course of business without regard to union activity.  the company said.Starbucks has faced a huge wave of organizing in recent months. Workers at more than 200 stores around the country have voted to join the union Workers United since the first elections in the Buffalo. New York. area last December. The company has fought the organizing effort from the beginning.The Ithaca filing revolves around one of the most severe charges coming from NLRB officials: that Starbucks is deliberately closing certain locations to crack down on the union campaign. Shuttering a workplace and causing workers to lose their jobs or be transferred can make other workers think twice before trying to organize.nukes the entire business)Baristas at the College Avenue store near Cornell University unionized in April. along with two other Starbucks locations in the college town. A week later. they went on strike to protest a broken grease trap they said had overflowed. causing a disgusting mess and unsafe working conditions inside. On June 3. Starbucks announced that it would be closing the College Avenue store for good. attributing the decision in part to the troublesome grease trap. The baristas were given one week s notice of the closure.Evan Sunshine. who worked at the College Avenue store. said Starbucks gave employees an  exhaustive list  of reasons why the store should be closed. but he believes there was one motivating factor.  They closed the store because we went on strike.  said Sunshine. a 20-year-old junior in the labor program at Cornell.  I think they wanted to scare partners out of unionizing. This is a whole city that unionized. three stores all within a couple miles of each other. [The workers] are very outspoken. This is the perfect opportunity to make them an example. In the complaint. the regional director alleges that Starbucks retaliated against Sunshine by refusing to grant him a transfer to another store or allow him to enroll in the company s  Coffee Master  program. Sunshine recently started working at a different Starbucks in Ithaca. He spent the summer interning in Washington. D.C.. and working at a unionized Starbucks store in Northern Virginia.Some of the College Avenue workers landed at nearby Starbucks locations but others took jobs with other employers. according to Sunshine. The union provided some financial assistance while baristas crowdfunded more for those who were left unemployed.Although Starbucks has shuttered several stores amid the union campaign. Starbucks Workers United says College Avenue was the first to be closed following a successful union election. The workers had voted 19-1 in favor of the union.The union alleges that Starbucks has fired dozens of organizers around the country due to their activism. though the company denies the claims. A federal judge recently ordered the company to temporarily reinstate seven workers in Memphis. Tennessee. who were fired earlier this year. saying there was  reasonable cause  to believe the firings were retaliatory. Starbucks appealed that ruling unsuccessfully.In the Ithaca case. Sunshine said he and his co-workers are heartened that the NLRB regional director found merit in their claims. We all thought for months now that we were retaliated against and treated incredibly poorly. … Now we have an institution telling us that it was completely unfair and illegal.  he said.,Health News

Andrés Gutiérrez Toro considered himself lucky. After Hurricane María destroyed Puerto Rico s electrical system ― triggering a historic 11-month blackout across much of the island ― and left thousands dead. he lost power for only five months. Still. the situation was so brutal that he ponied up to buy a diesel generator and solar panels. The investment paid off. The power grid never fully recovered from the 2017 storm. and it became even less reliable in June 2021. when LUMA Energy. a private company. took over electricity sales in the United States  most populous territorial possession. Monthly bills went up. and up and up ― seven rate hikes in total. Gutiérrez regularly paid almost $350 a month. and that was with the discount that came from producing his own solar power. Neighbors were paying upward of $500. The outages. meanwhile. got worse. averaging about three per month. lasting four hours or more each time. Gutiérrez. a family physician. opened his clinic to patients who couldn t afford generators. so diabetics could refrigerate insulin and asthmatics could use breathing machines. Now even that isn t enough to contain what Gutiérrez called the  domino effect  of the latest disaster. It s been nearly a month since Hurricane Fiona. a relatively minor Category 1 storm. once again knocked out Puerto Rico s entire power system. And much of Cabo Rojo. the west coast beach town where Gutiérrez lives with his wife and two kids. in a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood. remains without electricity from the power grid. It s the longest blackout since María. There are a lot of sick people who are diabetic. and they don t have electricity to do their diets. so they re eating whatever they can afford and don t have to use electricity to eat: fast foods. crackers. bread.  Gutiérrez. 46. said by phone last week.  So there s a domino effect. and we re seeing a lot of sick people come into the hospital right now because of it.  Few living in the 50 states have encountered this kind of systemic collapse. Fiona gathered enough strength as it headed north to hit Florida as a Category 4 hurricane. yet the state restored electricity to millions within days. Americans experienced a combined eight hours of power outages throughout all of 2020. and that was by far the highest average since records began seven years earlier. Before Fiona. Gutiérrez and his neighbors might go twice as long without electricity in a single month. And even that quality of service came at a premium: Puerto Ricans pay double the average U.S. electricity rate. even though the mostly Spanish-speaking Caribbean island is poorer than the most impoverished U.S. state. That a private company came into Puerto Rico to sell electricity at all is a consequence of the territory s painful bankruptcy and debt restructuring. which saw Congress install a financial oversight board with veto power over virtually any major decision from its elected government. In theory. a private firm like LUMA would want to please its customers by delivering efficient. effective services ― unlike. say. the corrupt old state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). which. while unable to pay its $9 billion share of the territory s debt. doled out sketchy contracts to big-name consultants and mainland U.S. companies.But while the $1.5 billion deal pays LUMA a fixed management fee and reimburses for everything from labor costs to employees  entertainment. the 16-year contract enshrined few. if any. penalties for poor service. Nor did the agreement require LUMA to honor PREPA s union contract. spurring hundreds of veteran line workers with experience maintaining Puerto Rico s grid to retire or quit. If LUMA was supposed to save PREPA money on electricity distribution. it s unclear how much ― the contract did not include a cost-benefit analysis. A review of public filings shows LUMA spent months making changes to PREPA s reconstructive plan. a move advocates say delayed upgrades that could have curbed power outages. The company then struggled to compromise with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. which controls the historic $16 billion budget Congress allocated to rebuild Puerto Rico s power system. over the scope of proposed projects. Meanwhile. Quanta Services. the Texas energy firm that owns 50% of LUMA. has for months told investors it plans to increase its revenue from Puerto Rico with lucrative additional contracts working on the grid. raising questions about how LUMA s construction priorities could benefit its parent company s future prospects. Even as the lights come back on in Puerto Rico. the island s government faces mounting pressure to cancel LUMA s contract as early as next month. when the island s government is set to decide whether to extend the temporary agreement under which the company is operating. while PREPA negotiates a settlement with its creditors. If that temporary contract expires on Nov. 30. a months-long separation process would begin. wherein control of the grid would likely return. at least in the near term. to the state-owned utility until the government can select a new operator. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi tamped down talk of ending the contract. calling instead for LUMA chief executive Wayne Stensby s resignation. But the territory s House of Representatives already passed a resolution calling for its termination. protests are growing in Puerto Rico and a public petition to call LUMA s deal off has gathered thousands of signatures in recent weeks. LUMA. meanwhile. is facing federal hearings before the U.S. House s Natural Resources Committee and calls from New York Attorney General Letitia James for a federal investigation into the company. There is certainly broadscale discontent with the company. and we ve not seen such united popular discontent since the 2019 ousting of the governor.  said Yarimar Bonilla. director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York City.  So. really I think it s not a matter of if LUMA should leave but rather when and how. Neither LUMA nor Quanta responded to multiple emails requesting interviews and submitting written questions. In the months after María. when millions of Puerto Ricans were vaulted back into a grueling premodern existence. solar panels offered a literal glimmer of hope as rooftop arrays turned sun-soaked Caribbean afternoons into charged phones. The cost of a 97% fossil-fueled grid was evident even before the power lines fell. The islands  biggest coal plant sired a mountain of toxic ash. the polluting diesel drove rates up. Not every country is well-suited to run almost entirely on renewables. but on a sunny day. rooftop solar alone could provide for Puerto Rico s yearly residential electricity needs four times over. according to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory study. Puerto Rico passed a law in 2019 requiring a 100% renewably powered grid by 2050. From 2016 to January 2022. the number of rooftop solar systems enrolled in the island s net-metering program grew eightfold. to 42.000. according to utility data first cited by the clean-energy trade publication Canary Media. Nearly 8.000 of those net-metering customers came on after LUMA. But if Puerto Rico planned to rebuild its grid around renewables from the ground up. LUMA may have seemed like a curious choice. As a private venture between Houston-based Quanta and Canada s ATCO Group. two of North America s biggest builders of long-distance transmission lines. the implicit goal of LUMA was the resurrection of a centralized electrical grid. the very thing a superstorm easily crumpled. at least $120 million in feesa Wall Street Journal op-edSure enough. LUMA voided the contract PREPA s union negotiated. and let hundreds ― by some estimates. thousands ― of workers leave. Delays began soon after. For the first few months. LUMA halted work on projects PREPA had already started to  promote alignment  between the two organizations and  ensure projects being pursued represented efficient and effective use.  Scheduled work on 10 substations. 11 generating plants and 25 transmission projects was pushed back by months. In regulatory filings. LUMA cited understaffing and  available contractor capacities  as a prime issue causing delays. The staffing issues came into focus over the past month. when municipalities hired former PREPA line workers to repair power lines on their own. Instead of waiting for LUMA. the quiet mountain town of Aibonito restored 99% of its power with private brigades. When the mayor of Aguadilla. a city of roughly 52.000 on the island s northwest coast. tried to do the same. LUMA threatened to withdraw its teams from the area and file a lawsuit against the municipality. The union representing LUMA s workers. meanwhile. blamed the company for cutting back on how much it trims trees over power lines. which brought limbs down on the lines during Fiona. LUMA also complained that  budget constraints  were slowing it down. reportIn its report. the GAO said Puerto Rico s LUMA  told us that they have had disagreements with FEMA on making repairs beyond the damages sustained during Hurricane Maria.  Specifically. the company said it disagreed with FEMA on what federal funding should cover. FEMA. for its part. told the GAO  there are nuances involved in developing a complex project and ensuring it is eligible under federal laws and regulations.  While the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands  power system faces its own issues. including persistent outages. the fellow storm-ravaged American territory offers a stark contrast in the GAO data. FEMA managed to spend close to $600 million in federal aid on permanent utility infrastructure. It s difficult to assess whether LUMA s disputes with federal officials over the scope of certain rebuilding projects give Quanta any advantage as it bids on future reconstruction work. But the Texas company. whose stock price has climbed 256% since LUMA s contract began. has from the start linked its 50% stake in the power company to the potential to win lucrative additional construction contracts down the road. In a press release announcing LUMA s winning bid in 2020. Quanta said it  believes there is opportunity for it to compete  for contracts that  are separate from its ownership interest in LUMA.  In August. with hundreds of Puerto Ricans protesting outages and the Atlantic hurricane season weeks away. Quanta Chief Executive Earl  Duke  Austin Jr. told investors that was still the strategy. On an earnings call with bank analysts. he said he expected federal funding to start  coming through now on the island  and that next year could be a fruitful one for the company.  I do think there ll be opportunities for us in 2023 to actually perform some construction that s outside the contract.  Austin said.ATCO. which splits half LUMA s earnings with Quanta. has made little mention of its Puerto Rican joint venture in quarterly earnings calls over the past year.There s nothing innately wrong with a company competing for federal contracts where it sees an advantage. Federal officials would be required to consider Quanta s past performance on other jobs. including with LUMA. said Virginia Canter. the chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. a watchdog group. PREPA has a long history of doling out sketchy contracts. Shortly after María. the state-run utility awarded a $300 million rebuilding deal to Whitefish Energy Holdings. a tiny Montana firm with ties to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. which months earlier had been on shaky financial ground. Following a national firestorm of criticism. PREPA canceled the contract.a $200 million contractThe utility then agreed to pay the Florida construction firm MasTec $400 per streetlight it repaired. even though the utility s union proposed to complete the same work for $60 per light. PREPA went on to pay former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) at least $300.000 in consulting fees and directed 84% of its contracts ― totaling $3.7 billion ― to mainland U.S. firms. a joint investigation by HuffPost and the Puerto Rican investigative reporter Bianca Graulau found in 2020. Tom Sanzillo. a former acting comptroller of New York state. said Quanta s plan to bid on contracts LUMA could influence represents a clear conflict of interest. particularly since LUMA s ownw contract gives Puerto Rico few options beyond cancellation for penalizing poor service. LUMA and its owners  interests should be in finding the cheapest and most effective contractors for Puerto Rico.  not being in competition for them.  said Sanzillo. who now serves as the director of financial analysis at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. a nonprofit research group that has published studies criticizing the privatization deal.  They should not be allowed to compete for those construction contracts. period.  Sanzillo said.  That s clearly unethical. The only partial nature of the privatization gives LUMA few incentives for costly. long-term investments. he said. When governments sell public infrastructure to private companies. those become assets the firm can make money off of in the long term. LUMA. however. is only serving as a contractor to maintain and run the system. The only incentive they have for construction is to milk it for as much as they can to get more outside the bounds of the contract.  Sanzillo said.  There s no financial incentive for them within the contract to act in a way as if they were an owner.  Private companies contracted to carry out government services typically come at a high price. at least on the federal level. Contractors were paid 1.8 times more than government employees for the same work and more than two times the total compensation in the private sector for comparable services. according to a 2011 analysis of federal contracts by the Project on Government Oversight. a watchdog group. Federal contracts to rebuild the grid are  where the big money is.  said Ruth Santiago. a prominent lawyer and public health activist who lives near Puerto Rico s biggest coal plant. The LUMA contract is only for operation and maintenance. It s not where the big money is.  Santiago said.  Quanta told its investors that it was looking forward to bidding on projects that its newly created joint venture LUMA Energy would be putting out for federal funds. Almost admitting a conflict of interest there. Dubbed  the world s oldest colony  after more than 500 years under Spanish and then U.S. rule. Puerto Rico has long had its economic fortunes dictated by decisions made far from San Juan. Sugar plantations. many worked by slaves. dominated the fertile. resource-rich island for centuries. Following a spate of New Deal infrastructure investments. the territory became a manufacturing hub. attracting pharmaceutical companies in particular. At one point. every little blue Viagra pill sold in North America was produced on the so-called enchanted island. Those were the boom years. when the U.S. was determined to make Puerto Rico an example of its capitalist system s superiority to neighboring Cuba s communism. In 1996. however. President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress ended the tax breakattracted corporations to the island. As companies departed Puerto Rico. the territory s tax base shrunk and good jobs left. To make up the difference. the government hired more workers and borrowed more money on the bond market. Since Puerto Rico s territorial status meant it could not legally go bankrupt and lenders assumed it to have the full backing of the U.S. Treasury. the territory became known as the  belle of the bond markets.  But by the mid-2010s. the bond debt had grown to $74 billion. and a $49 billion gap opened between how much money the government had for public workers  pensions and how much it needed to find. The debt. meanwhile. fell into the hands of the Wall Street equivalent of loan sharks. who buy distressed debt on the cheap and invest money into a relentless legal pursuit of payments. Puerto Rico s economy was on the verge of ruin. In 2016. Congress passed a law effectively allowing Puerto Rico to go bankrupt and installing the all-powerful financial oversight board. which locals nicknamed  la junta.  a title often used for the kinds of military dictatorships the U.S. propped up across Latin America during the Cold War. Hundreds of schools closed. craterous potholes opened in major highways and retirees faced pension cuts. Yet the power grid. much of which had been built half a century earlier. remained hooked on expensive and heavily polluting sources of electricity. such as coal and diesel. It was no match for María s 175 mile per hour winds. one led byLess than six months after LUMA took over. however. the company failed to turn over documents to local lawmakers. prompting a judge to issue an arrest warrant for CEO Wayne Stensby. The executive avoided arrest. and LUMA said it submitted all the required paperwork. Among the documents were invoices showing Stensby taking a $1.1 million salary. In April. the same month lawmakers approved a resolution calling for the cancellation of LUMA s contract. four chain-restaurant corporations (Wendco of Puerto Rico. Restaurant Operators. MultiSystem Restaurant and Apple Caribe. which together represent Wendy s. Olive Garden. LongHorn Steakhouse. Applebee s. Red Lobster and Sizzler) sued LUMA for $310 million in damages they say voltage fluctuations caused to their kitchen equipment. LUMA insisted it was making progress. telling The Associated Press in August that it had reduced power outages by 30% this year compared with last year and had repaired 3.800 electric posts. replaced 10.000 streetlights and begun 209 post-hurricane projects with federal funding. Data from Puerto Rico s Energy Bureau told a different story. From January to August. the duration of monthly blackouts increased to an average of 21 hours. with no improvement in the frequency of interruptions. according to the regulatory agency s report. President Joe Biden visited the island after Fiona and indicated that the Department of Energy would take a bigger role in shaping how the grid is rebuilt. But the power grid is hardly the territory s only crisis. Housing prices have shot up across the island as wealthy investors with plenty of money for diesel generators buy up property in a bid to take advantage of Puerto Rico s tax haven laws. which allow rich newcomers to avoid both federal and local income taxes. And developers have repeatedly tried to stake claims to public beaches. Despite being a direct violation of Puerto Rico s constitutional guarantee of beach access. it has taken massive. sustained protests to halt construction projects on beaches that should have raised red flags just by the obvious risk sea-level rise and storms pose amid worsening global warming. as in Hawaiithe sort of quasi-independenceenjoythorny questionsla bregaseries of disastrous earthquakesThe money to buy solar panels and a generator that costs more than $800 to fuel with diesel offers only nominal reprieve. The schools have no air conditioning. The water systems won t run because the well pumps lack power. And the internet service providers. unless they have generators. don t work.  We re trying to survive right here.  Gutiérrez said.  But I ve been thinking about moving away from Puerto Rico. planning to go to the states and have a proper life with my kids.

New York. have voted decisively against forming a union. rejecting a bid by organizers to create the company s second unionized facility in the U.S.Employees at the ALB1 facility in Castleton would have been represented by the Amazon Labor Union. the same upstart group that won a historic election at the company s JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island in New York City earlier this year. The  no  votes came out ahead by a roughly 2-1 margin.Chris Smalls. president of the ALU. said in a statement that the voting process  wasn t free and fair.  It was a sham election where workers were subjected to intimidation and retaliation on a daily basis and even the workers who volunteered to be election observers were faced with threats of termination.  Smalls alleged.He added.  This won t be the end of ALU at ALB1. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the company would  continue to work directly with our teammates in Albany.  We re glad that our team in Albany was able to have their voices heard. and that they chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers.  Nantel said.The union may choose to challenge the election results and demand a second vote. arguing that Amazon broke labor law during the campaign. The National Labor Relations Board. the federal agency that oversees private-sector union elections. has not yet certified the results. The union would have a week to make an appeal.The ALB1 facility handles large merchandise that s shipped out to customers and employs around 900 workers. It is much smaller by headcount than the Staten Island facility. which employs around 8.000 people.After prevailing at JFK8. the ALU lost their second vote in May at another. smaller facility in New York City. A loss at the facility near Albany would mark the union s second defeat. The ALU recently filed for another election at a warehouse in Southern California.The vote count for ALB1 was conducted at the labor board s office in Albany and broadcast to the public over Zoom. The retail and tech giant is one of several major U.S. employers facing an organizing wave in the workplace. The NLRB recently said workers filed more union election petitions this past fiscal year than in any since 2016. Companies including Amazon. Starbucks. Trader Joe s. REI and Apple have all seen a share of their U.S. workforces unionize for the first time in recent months.Amazon. which now employs roughly a million American workers. has fought its employees  organizing efforts for years. In 2021. it spent more than $4 million on union-avoidance consultants who held group and one-on-one meetings meant to undermine union support. The ALU said the company held mandatory sessions at ALB1 where employees listened to anti-union talking points.The NLRB s general counsel recently found merit in allegations from the union that Amazon violated the law by holding such meetings. and by threatening to withhold certain benefits if workers chose to unionize. This story has been updated with comment from Amazon and the ALU.,Health News
For years now. the United States has had the technology to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks before the planet-heating gas enters the atmosphere. But carbon capture and storage hardware proved so expensive and clunky that one of the only ways to make a so-called CCS investment pencil out was to sell the CO2 to oil drillers. who inject the supercooled gas into wells to get at hard-to-reach crude. As a result. 73% of 43 million tons of carbon diverted from smokestacks worldwide last year ended up producing more oil. counteracting any real climate benefits the CCS could have had. By comparison. just 20% of that pollution wound up in underground storage aquifers. where it makes the biggest difference in terms of emissions. By 2030. however. those numbers are set to reverse. Thanks in large part to President Joe Biden s landmark federal climate law. just 20% of carbon is forecast to go to oil drilling. while 66% is destined for underground storage. according to a new study from the energy consultancy BloombergNEF. Another 12% will likely be used in other industries. such as chemical production or soda carbonation.Attempts at transforming carbon dioxide from a freely-dumped waste product into a valued commodity have hitherto failed. Congress started incentivizing carbon capture with a tax credit known as 45Q in 2008. but set the payout per ton of CO2 too low. Federal lawmakers tried fixing the problem in 2018 by raising the price to $35 per ton for CO2 used in oil drilling. and $50 per ton for carbon stored underground. But it took the Internal Revenue Service until January 2021 to issue guidelines for how those credits could be used. And even then. it made more sense in many cases to sell CO2 for oil drilling. With oil prices at $100 per barrel. the sale of CO2 plus a $35 credit would equal out to $58 per ton. well above the flat $50 earned for storing the gas. Under the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act. selling captured carbon to an oil driller is now worth $60 per ton. Combined with revenues from $100-per-barrel oil. that ton of CO2 could net $73. But the federal government will now let polluters write $85 off their taxes for every ton of CO2 stored underground: a $12 million difference for a company that might capture 1 million tons of CO2 every year. CCS is cheapest at facilities whose flue gas is pure carbon dioxide. meaning that only a few industries — such as natural gas processing or the production of corn into ethanol fuel — really benefited from the old payouts. Under the higher credits. manufacturers of steel. cement and petrochemicals can make money off carbon capture installations. The dramatic shift over the next eight years will come as the world deploys six times as much CCS equipment as exists today. with the potential to capture 279 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. On its own. that surge will do little to change the trajectory of global warming. covering just 0.6% of today s emissions and taking place overwhelmingly in rich nations. with the U.S. dominating nearly half the market. and the United Kingdom and Canada trailing with 14% and 9% of global capacity for capturing carbon dioxide. respectively. But researchers say it s a necessary first step toward bringing down costs for poorer countries with faster-growing emissions. where carbon capture can make the biggest global impact.  It s still the usual suspects as far as 2030.  said Julia Attwood. the head of sustainable materials at BNEF.  But once those countries have built a lot of capacity and lowered the cost for everybody. that s when you ll see countries like China and others in Southeast Asia following. Still. it s a controversial gambit. After two decades of high-profile failed attempts to commercialize CCS. environmentalists have largely written the technology off as a fig leaf fossil fuel that producers use to justify continued investments in oil and gas production.experts sayfirst wave of infrastructure could also spur companies to not only capture and transport carbon from polluting plants but actually start cleaning up CO2 spewed long ago. Removing carbon from the atmosphere. where it can circulate for centuries. is needed to reduce the damage the last three centuries of fossil-fuel-based industrialization have wrought. While trees naturally suck up CO2 through photosynthesis and certain soil techniques could also help. the need for measurable. increased carbon removal is driving investments in what s known as direct air capture. a type of carbon capture that essentially vacuums CO2 from the sky. Under the new 45Q tax credit. the federal government will pay between $130 and $180 per ton of carbon dioxide removed via direct air capture.  We think the U.S. is now the best place in the world to do direct air capture given the subsidies that are available and the potential transport and storage that could be coming online.  Attwood said. Transportation and storage remain major bottlenecks. The U.S. has a small. aging network of highly pressurized pipelines to ship CO2 around. New pipelines are being proposed. with the first set expected to break ground in the Midwest as a way to ship carbon dioxide from ethanol facilities to storage wells. Earlier this month. the federal government started taking applications for up to $2 billion in loans for CO2 transportation projects. But opposition is growing. fueled by fears of the health risks CO2 leaks pose and concern federal regulators aren t up to the task of ensuring their safety. The federal permitting process for the first well to permanently store CO2. meanwhile. took more than half a decade to complete. At least two states now have approval to complete their own permitting without a separate federal process. But a faster. more efficient procedure that wins over local communities will be needed to make a bigger dent in emissions.  We need to permit projects.  said Julio Friedmann. a leading carbon capture researcher and former Department of Energy appointee who reviewed the BNEF findings for HuffPost but did not participate in the study.  That means doing a good job in equity and justice. It means listening to concerns of communities that will host projects. And that means agencies in the state and federal governments working hard to get to yes. The planet has already warmed. on average. 1.1 degrees Celsius. To avoid another disastrous half a degree of heating or more. Friedmann said.  frankly. we need to be more aggressive in our deployment of CCS.  ,Health News
A group of Starbucks workers in South Carolina have sued the company for defamation after a store manager accused them of assault and kidnapping during a workplace protest.The lawsuit filed in South Carolina state court revolves around an Aug. 1 incident at an Anderson store where workers approached their supervisor and gave her a letter demanding higher wages ― a common tactic in labor organizing known as a  march on the boss.  The manager later filed a police report alleging that the workers refused to let her leave the store until they got a pay hike. and that one of them assaulted her ― accusations the workers and their union denied. A spokesperson for the local sheriff s office later told The State that  none of the allegations  from the manager were true.Starbucks said in a statement Monday that it was reviewing the lawsuit. No Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity — but interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.  the company said.A TikTok video of a portion of the incident shows workers lined up around a table where the manager is seated on a cellphone. She gets up to leave and bumps a worker who s in her path along the table.  Why are you pushing him?  a voice asks the manager. The eight workers who filed the lawsuit claim Starbucks injured their reputations by  falsely stating or insinuating that they had engaged in criminal assault and kidnapping and engaged in threatened conduct.  They say they ve suffered emotional distress as a result of the allegations.The workers named Starbucks as a co-defendant in the suit. saying the manager consulted with higher-ups on the filing of her report and took part in a  coordinated response.  [Her] statement to police was false ― no employee blocked the exit. and no employee assaulted her.  their complaint states.Starbucks suspended the workers pending an investigation. and barred them from going on other Starbucks properties.According to the lawsuit. an attorney for Starbucks contacted the workers  union. Workers United. following the incident and accused one member of  abusive. belligerent. and menacing conduct.  That worker. Aneil Tripathi. said Monday that  Starbucks knew exactly what they were doing when it smeared our reputation. painting us as criminals.  This case is about more than defamation.  Tripathi said.  It s about highlighting the disgusting and outright abuse Starbucks will level at their own workers. The spat in South Carolina is part of a broader fight between the company and the union campaign. Starbucks Workers United. Workers at more than 200 Starbucks stores have unionized in a matter of months. Starbucks has opposed the campaign all along. and union members have accused the company of retaliating against them through firings. suspensions and store closures. The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has found merit in many of the workers  claims. filing more than 20 complaints against the company alleging labor law violations. Those cases are now being litigated.Correction: This story originally misidentified the town where the Starbucks store is located. It is Anderson. not Andersonville.,Health News
Medieval Times has sued the union representing its employees at a New Jersey castle. alleging it has infringed on the dinner-theater chain s trademark.In its lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court. Medieval Times said the union. the American Guild of Variety Artists. had created  consumer confusion  by allowing workers to use the name  Medieval Times Performers United. The company claims the union is  threatening the established goodwill of Medieval Times  by including the chain s name and medieval-themed imagery in its name and logo. The elements featured in the Medieval Times Performers Logo (i.e.. castle. swords. old script style text) all resemble elements of Medieval Times s branding and middle ages-themed décor. which are clearly meant to evoke Medieval Times  unique image.  the company said in its lawsuit.Medieval Times could not be reached for comment. The union said in a statement that the lawsuit was  frivolous  and meant to intimidate employees who are trying to organize.

It is a grotesque attempt to retaliate against workers for exercising their legally protected right to form a union and bargain collectively. But it will fail.  the AGVA said.

Workers at a CVS store in Orange County. California. were trying to form a union last year when they got a surprise from their employer. The pharmacy chain had decided to give them substantial raises. boosting their pay as much as 37%.CVS was doing  market  pay adjustments at many of its stores. But the company earmarked certain locations in California ― an area where the United Food and Commercial Workers union was running an organizing campaign ― for juicier pay bumps than the formula called for. according to hearing transcripts and CVS documents obtained through a public records request.Workers at Store 9119 in Orange County were among them. They were in the midst of signing union cards to join UFCW Local 324. Unlike most other nonunion workers. they ended up with the higher pay rates that already-unionized stores in the area were receiving. only they got them without having to join the union and pay dues. I thought it was a very weird coincidence that it was the exact same number.  one CVS worker recently said of her raise matching the union pay rate. The worker was testifying in a hearing before the National Labor Relations Board. the federal agency that referees disputes between unions and employers.Suddenly raising pay or benefits is a tried-and-true way for employers to tamp down union support. since it makes some workers believe a union is no longer necessary. With pandemic-weary U.S. workers requesting union elections at a rate not seen in years. some are watching their employers scramble to improve the workplace for fear they ll end up across from their employees at the bargaining table.Employers need to be careful when changing pay or benefits where workers are considering unionizing. lest it come off as coercive and disrupt the  laboratory conditions  under which workers are supposed to vote in an election. They can hike workers  pay as part of a standard review process. but it s against the law to do so expressly to undermine a union campaign.At Store 9119. workers cast their ballots less than three weeks after learning of their new raises. Eight workers voted in favor of joining the UFCW. Nine voted against.Ryan Spillers. a union-side attorney who represented the UFCW at the labor board. said the company tried to hide the higher-than-market raises for certain workers by rolling them into its nationwide raise announcement. The message was unmistakable.  Spillers said.  Why go to the trouble of organizing when we ll just gift you the union rate for free? recently agreedboard filingsFrom a worker s labor board testimony:Starbucks has rolled out a host of new and improved perks at its coffee shops while battling a nationwide union effort since last year. applying them to the majority of stores that have not yet unionized. Trader Joe s recently announced a new $10-per-hour pay premium for working on Sundays and holidays. just as workers were launching a soon-to-be-successful union campaign that has spread to other stores.Companies typically deny that they made any improvements in direct response to labor organizing campaigns. What sets the CVS case apart is how internal emails and spreadsheets ― brought to light by a subpoena from the NLRB ― shed light on the company s decision-making process. They were definitely masking what they were trying to do here.  Joe Hernandez. the organizing director for UFCW Local 324. told HuffPost.The UFCW already represents thousands of pharmacy chain workers around the country. Hernandez said the union organized many CVS stores in California following a 2013 agreement between the union and the company that made it easier for workers to hold elections. Store 9119 did not unionize while that agreement was in effect. so the union s organizers took another crack at it last year. They went into the store and passed out cards showing the top rates workers would earn if they were unionized like other pharmacies.By the summer of 2021. the workers felt stretched thin due to lean staffing and the COVID-19 vaccination campaign that boosted foot traffic in pharmacies. Hernandez said. Safety measures weren t in place. People were getting COVID. They were rolling out the vaccines.  he said.  People were overworked and stressed. Staffing was a big issue. Some stores went automatically and said. ‘Yeah. we want a union.  Three CVS stores in Southern California filed for union elections last July. while workers at Store 9119 were signing union cards in hopes of holding their own. Days after the three petitions were filed. CVS  senior director of compensation emailed the company s vice president of labor relations. with the subject line  Retail California Non-Union Pay Rates.  He listed 49 job codes and wrote  we will need to know how to handle EACH ONE of them. The labor relations department sent back a breakdown of union pay rates in California. The compensation team responded:  We will begin working on the analysis. applying the Union rates provided to Non-Union colleagues  in certain job roles. Documents CVS provided under subpoena suggest that out of around 9.000 workers slated for raises. a subset of only 1.100 would end up getting the higher. union pay rates. Two weeks later. CVS blasted out a press release celebrating a new investment in its workforce. saying it would raise its minimum wage in retail stores to $15 by July 2022.Before workers at Store 9119 cast their ballots. they received visits at the store from CVS human-resources representatives. who discussed the new raises and asked how the company could be a better employer. according to labor board testimony.One pharmacy technician testified how taken aback they were by the size of the pay bumps.  Wow. I can t believe how much money this is.  she recalled a co-worker saying. I made the comment that I wonder if it s probably because we just filed with the Union. you know. the prior day.  the worker recounted.  And she said to me. ‘That doesn t make a difference. … I m still voting yes.  Another worker testified that just two weeks earlier she had requested a raise and been told she would need to apply for a higher position if she wanted one. With the new pay scale. her pay went from $19.69 to $23.40 per hour. She rescinded her application for the better-paying job.The judge in the case. Dickie Montemayor. wrote that it was reasonable to conclude that the  manner. timing. and size of the wage increases was to dissuade and diminish support for the union in the upcoming election.  He also found that CVS broke the law on election day. when the company s election observer spoke to an intern who was headed into the voting booth.Montemayor recommended that a new vote be scheduled. The board in Washington has not yet ruled on CVS s appeal.Hernandez said he has no doubts that the pay increases swayed the election.  People got [big] raises.  he said.  Good for them. But it played into why they voted ‘no  in the end. He added that the union s supporters are eager to get their next ballots. Now that they know what CVS did. they re looking forward to the second election.  he said.,Health News
German apparel company Adidas announced Thursday that its business partnership with rapper and fashion designer Ye (formally known as Kanye West) is  under review.  After repeated efforts to privately resolve the situation. we have taken the decision to place the partnership under review.  the company said in a statement obtained by CNBC.  We will continue to co-manage the current product during this period. The company also said its relationship with West has been  one of the most successful collaborations in our industry s history. West. 45. posted a vulgar response to Adidas on Instagram about its recent announcement. FUUUUUUCK ADIDAS I AM ADIDAS ADIDAS RAPED AND STOLE MY DESIGNS. West started working with Adidas to distribute his Yeezy brand of sneakers and apparel in 2013. Forbes estimates that the partnership is worth $1.5 billion.This Adidas announcement comes days after West wore a  White Lives Matter  T-shirt at his Yeezy runway event on Tuesday during Paris Fashion Week. A picture of West and right-wing pundit Candace Owens. wearing the controversial shirt in white. drew criticism from celebrities and Black Lives Matter supporters. including the mother of Ahmaud Arbery. Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was chased and killed by three white men in February 2020 in Glynn County. Georgia. In response to the death of Arbery. protesters demonstrated across the country calling for justice for his death and the deaths of other unarmed Black victims.West donated $2 million to the families of Arbery. Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in June 2020. The relationship between West and Adidas has been rocky over the past few months. West has called out Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted and accused him of stealing his designs. In June. West told Rorsted in a now-deleted Instagram post that  I m not standing for this blatant copying no more.  West also put photos of Adidas executives in now-deleted Instagram posts and made fun of their appearances.In September. West terminated his three-year partnership with Gap under similar circumstances. His lawyers said the fashion company broke their agreement by not releasing merchandise and opening multiple store locations. according to The Wall Street Journal.,Health News
TwitterElon Muskthe Tesla CEOagainst Twitter s lawsuitrevived the takeover offer on MondayChancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick. head of the Delaware Chancery Court. said Thursday that Musk and Twitter now have until Oct. 28 to close the deal. A trial originally set for Oct. 17 will happen in November if they don t. she said.Twitter had asked McCormick earlier Thursday to proceed with the trial. saying the billionaire refuses to accept the  contractual obligations  of his April agreement to buy the social media company and take it private.Twitter disputed Musk s claim that the San Francisco-based company is refusing to accept his renewed bid. Musk told Twitter earlier this week he s ready to buy the company once again after trying to back out of the deal over the summer. accusing it of refusing to give him information about  spam bot  accounts on the service.Twitter described Musk s move to delay the trial as  an invitation to further mischief and delay  after his arguments for terminating the agreement haven t had merit.But after the judge s ruling. Twitter reiterated in a statement that it was ready to close the deal on the share price agreed upon in April:  We look forward to closing the transaction at $54.20 by October 28th.  referring to the price Musk originally offered for each Twitter share.Brooklyn Law School professor Andrew Jennings said Twitter wants to be certain that the deal will get done and not allow  wiggle room for Musk to walk away again. Musk attorneys argued that Twitter was disagreeing with the trial delay  based on the theoretical possibility  of Musk not coming up with the financing. which they called  baseless speculation. They said Musk s financial backers  have indicated that they are prepared to honor their commitments  and are working to close the deal by Oct. 28.Musk attorney Alex Spiro said in a statement Thursday that  Twitter offered Mr. Musk billions off the transaction price  but Musk  refused because Twitter attempted to put certain self-serving conditions on the deal.  He didn t elaborate on what those conditions were. Twitter hasn t described the talks beyond what its attorneys have said in court.Twitter s shares fell $1.91. or 3.7%. to close at $49.39 on Thursday. It was the stock s second day of declines following a surge of more than 22% on Tuesday after Musk made his renewed offer to buy the company.,Health News

To hit its climate goals. the United States is betting on technology that captures planet-heating carbon dioxide at industrial plants before it enters the atmosphere. For that hardware to make sense financially. the country will need as many as 30.000 miles of new pipelines ― more than all the gas pipelines in California. New York and Pennsylvania combined — to ship that CO2 from where it s captured to where it can be used or buried underground.The Biden administration is ready to make the down payment on that infrastructure buildout.On Thursday. the Department of Energy launched a $2 billion loan program to fund construction of pipelines. rail transport and other shipping methods. the agency told HuffPost. Called the Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program. or CIFIA. the fund will be available through 2026. unless it s fully spent before then. and will be administered jointly by the Energy Department s Loan Programs Office and Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management. One giant challenge in deploying carbon management technologies to reduce emissions is to be able to transport the CO2 to where it is ultimately sequestered or used up.  Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement to HuffPost.  The CIFIA program will help industry overcome the challenges to accessing the upfront capital needed to build shared infrastructure projects that are essential to advancing our clean energy economy. The program will undoubtedly draw some controversy. and possibly resistance from landholders and other stakeholders regarding proposed pipelines.The U.S. has operated a small network of carbon dioxide pipelines for more than half a century. Until 2020. it was widely viewed as safe. But that year. a CO2 pipeline ruptured in Satartia. Mississippi. spewing a cloud of carbon dioxide that sickened dozens of people in the surrounding area. a HuffPost investigation found in 2021. Since CO2 pushes out the oxygen needed to ignite an engine. the accident disabled motor vehicles. making it impossible for victims to escape.In response. the U.S. Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration announced in May it would set new rules and standards for CO2 pipelines. The agency is scheduled to unveil its new proposals later this year.But the agency is perennially understaffed. and President Joe Biden has yet to nominate an official leader. The agency has few new tools or inspectors to help carry out its widening portfolio of tasks. according to a Roll Call report.Landowners and environmentalists who oppose new pipelines are also organizing against proposals like the Summit Carbon Solutions plan to build a 680-mile project through Iowa for carbon dioxide captured at ethanol plants. The vast amounts of farmland and fertilizer needed to grow corn for ethanol can translate into 24% higher emissions for the biofuel than equivalent quantities of gasoline. according to one recent study. And environmentalists have long complained that propped-up carbon capture technology generally makes it easier to keep using fossil fuels even when alternatives that are safer for the climate exist. particularly in sectors such as electricity generation. But experts say there are few better options to decarbonize parts of the industrial sector that depend on fossil fuels to reach the high temperatures needed for making chemicals. steel and cement ― all of which are set to surge in demand as the country builds more renewable-energy plants. power lines and electric vehicles. If recently enacted tax credits for capturing carbon dioxide are  not used at a wide variety of industrial facilities. then something has gone very seriously wrong.  Rebecca Dell. a carbon capture expert and the industrial emissions lead at the San Francisco-based ClimateWorks Foundation. told HuffPost in August. That. she said.  is going to require pipelines. ,Health News
Elon MuskTwittersocial media platform.mercurial Tesla CEOThe offer comes just two weeks before Twitter s lawsuit seeking to force Musk to go through with the deal goes to trial in Delaware Chancery Court.In a statement. Twitter said it intends to close the transaction at $54.20 per share after receiving the letter from Musk.Trading in Twitter s stock. which had been halted for much of the day pending release of the news. resumed trading late Tuesday and soared almost 22% to $51.80.Musk s proposal is the latest twist in a high-profile saga involving the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms. Much of the drama has played out on Twitter itself. with Musk — who has more than 100 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.A letter from Musk s lawyer dated Monday and disclosed by Twitter in a securities filing said Musk would close the merger signed in April provided that the Delaware Chancery Court  enter an immediate stay  of Twitter s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to begin in two weeks.By completing the deal. Musk essentially gave Twitter what it was seeking from the court —  specific performance  of the contract with Musk. meaning he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price. The contract Musk signed also has a $1 billion breakup fee.Eric Talley. a law professor at Columbia University. said he s not surprised by Musk s turnaround. especially ahead of a scheduled deposition of Musk by Twitter attorneys starting Thursday that was  not going to be pleasant.  On the legal merits. his case didn t look that strong.  Talley said.  It kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer s remorse case. If Musk were to lose the trial. the judge could not only force him to close the deal but also impose interest payments that would have increased its cost. Talley said.What did surprise Talley is that Musk doesn t appear to be trying to renegotiate the deal. Even a modest price reduction might have given Musk a  moral victory  and the ability to say he got something out of the protracted dispute. Talley said.Neither Twitter nor attorneys for Musk responded to requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.trying to back out of the deal for several monthsfake accounts on its platformMusk s argument largely rested on the allegation that Twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of  spam bot  accounts that are useless to advertisers. Most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick. the court s head judge. that something changed since the April merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal.Legal experts said Musk may have anticipated that he would lose. Things haven t been going well for him in court recently. with the judge ruling more frequently in Twitter s favor on evidentiary matters. said Ann Lipton. an associate law professor at Tulane University. The judge s denied several of Musk s discovery requests. Lipton said.It s also possible that Musk s co-investors in the deal were starting to get nervous about how the case was proceeding. she said.Musk s main argument for terminating the deal – that Twitter was misrepresenting how it measured its  spam bot  problem – also didn t appear to be going well as Twitter had been working to pick apart Musk s attempts to get third-party data scientists to bolster his concerns.Twitter now has options in the case and doesn t necessarily have to accept a new offer from Musk. said Robert Anderson. a law professor at Pepperdine University. Twitter could still be concerned that the same thing might happen again without some additional security.  Anderson said.  They re going to want some assurance that the deal is going to happen right away. Columbia s Talley said he would insist on Musk putting money into an escrow account until the deal is completed. Such an account could hold cash and/or Twitter shares. as a good-faith demonstration by Musk. Talley suggested.Mysteriously. neither Musk nor Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal have written anything about the deal on Twitter. where many developments in the dispute have been aired. Many of Musk s tweets in the past 24 hours have been about a divisive proposal to end Russia s invasion of Ukraine. drawing the ire of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Musk argued in a tweet Monday that to reach peace Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula that it seized in 2014. He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status. dropping a bid to join NATO following Russia s partial mobilization of reservists.If the deal does go through. Musk may be stuck with a company he damaged with repeated statements denoucing fake accounts. Susannah Streeter. senior markets analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown in the United Kingdom. wrote in an investor note.  This is an important metric considered to be key for future revenue streams via paid advertising or for subscriptions on the site. and his relentless scrutiny of Twitter s figures over the last few months is likely to prompt questions from potential advertising partners.  she wrote.If Musk were to lose. among the remedies that would favor Twitter is a court order to go through with the deal. The Chancery Court last year forced private equity firm Kohlberg & Co. to go through with its $550 million buyout of DecoPac. a company based in Minnesota that calls itself the world s largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries. The case was emblematic of the court s common — though not uniform — resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers.Other options include Musk being forced to pay the breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through. Or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for $44 billion.____Marcy Gordon in Washington contributed to this report.,Health News
Shortly after 1 a.m. on July 6. 2013. Bernard Théberge stepped outside a bar in eastern Québec for a cigarette. At just that moment. a runaway freight train carrying 2.1 million gallons of oil throttled into Lac-Mégantic. a tiny town near the Maine border. The train derailed and exploded in a giant fireball. When he saw the flames. Théberge started pedaling away on his bike. Soon after. the entire downtown was decimated. killing 47 in Canada s deadliest rail accident since 1894.  Smoking saved my life.  Théberge later told The Globe and Mail newspaper.It was hardly the first accident of its kind. In 1996. a train carrying propane and natural gas flew off the tracks and exploded in an inferno that burned for weeks in a rural Wisconsin town. forcing 3.000 people to evacuate for nearly a month. Miraculously. no one was injured. The chief executive of the Wisconsin rail company behind the accident would go on to serve as CEO of Montreal Maine and Atlantic Railway. the company responsible for the Lac-Mégantic disaster 17 years later. MMA. as the firm was known. changed hands twice more. becoming a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway in 2020.Deregulation on both sides of the border has allowed railroads to rake in cash by cutting costs and consolidating the continent s railways from 40 major rail companies in 1980 to just seven today.Now Canadian Pacific is eying an even bigger prize — with a potential payoff from connecting Canada s uniquely dirty oil fields to U.S. refineries on the Gulf of Mexico and creating what analysts say could be an attractive new backup route for crude producers if pipelines shut down. If successful. it could increase how much oil is passing by rail through certain parts of the United States. despite a long line of catastrophes. Since 2013. at least 20 more oil-freighting locomotives — dubbed  bomb trains  by environmentalists — went off the rails across North America.The Calgary-based giant is seeking approval from U.S. regulators to buy rail giant Kansas City Southern in a $27 billion deal that would fuse the two smallest of the remaining so-called Class 1 railways into the first system with connections to the U.S.. Canada and Mexico — but leave the continent with just six separate operators. The so-called  NAFTA super railway  could increase rail traffic of fast-moving. miles-long trains by over 300% in some regions.At a regulatory hearing on the deal Wednesday. Bill Gluba. the former mayor of Davenport. Iowa. gave a grave assessment of what that could mean for a stretch of his Mississippi River city that hosts baseball games and festivals. When one of those trains derails while passing through one of these events.  Gluba said.  it won t be 47 people killed like tragically happened in Canada. it will be hundreds of people.  This is a disaster of monumental proportions just waiting to happen. Currently. crude mostly makes its way from the tar sands producers in Alberta down to refiners in Texas and Louisiana via pipelines. which analysts say will continue to be the case. since rail shipments are always more expensive. The fraction of U.S. imports that do travel by train come by way of Canadian National Railway. which boasts North America s longest rail network.But Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern have long sought a piece of that market. Last year. Canadian Pacific started running specialized new oil trains carrying Canadian imports through Minnesota. The company declined to tell the Minneapolis Star Tribune how many of the new trains it was running. But the railroad s chief marketing officer told Wall Street analysts in a July 2021 earnings call that he expects  the business to ramp up to 15 or 20 trains per month  as they travel down to Port Arthur. Texas.In 2019. the two firms inked an unprecedented 10-year deal to haul oil bitumen — a thicker. more viscous type of crude that operators say is less prone to accidents because the flammable diluting substances are removed — from Canada down to the U.S. Gulf. using a new technology Canadian Pacific said is much safer and less likely to explode.Railway officials say the flow of oil won t be impacted by any merger. The volume of crude oil shipments from source to refinery is determined by macroeconomic forces that will not be affected by the transaction. so the [Canada Pacific-Kansas City Southern] combination will not cause more crude oil to be shipped by rail.  Patrick Waldron. a Canadian Pacific spokesperson. wrote in an email.But if the U.S. Surface Transportation Board gives the Canadian Pacific-Kansas City Southern merger the green light. the new route could make it cheaper and easier to ship crude that may have otherwise flowed through the now-defunct Keystone XL pipeline. It is a deliberate. intentional workaround for the loss of Keystone. at least. the fossil fuel industry is viewing it that way.  said Conan Smith. president of the Michigan Environmental Council. which opposes a merger that would likely increase shipments of oil through an area of Detroit known as the Great Lake State s most polluted ZIP code. The oil industry has been looking to increase transport to those southern states by any means necessary.  he added.  The introduction of a secondary route is going to make that more viable. The federal regulator earlier this month extended the deadline for environmental comments on the proposed merger to Oct. 14.Canadian Pacific said it s hoping to see the biggest bump in profits after the merger from hauling cargo shipments. Known as  intermodal  shipments. the category has been one of the few sectors where railroads have seen significant growth in recent years as trucking gobbled up the freight market.As a result. the railroad giant said its deal would help take long-haul trucks off the road. Railroads have often complained that trucking companies are unfairly subsidized in that they don t pay to maintain federal highways. despite the damage increased tractor-trailer traffic causes. while rail operators are solely responsible for maintaining rail lines.Intermodal shipping. Waldron said. would be the  primary driver  of new traffic. and could actually be a climate benefit. since the company projects it could reduce demand for as many as 64.000 tractor-trailer trucks.datashipments by railThe reason: Two pipelines got up and running. Last October. the Line 3 replacement project. a hotly protested 1.031-mile pipeline carrying crude from Alberta to Wisconsin. started operation. marking the first expansion of Canadian export capacity in at least six years.Then Marathon Petroleum reversed the flow of the Capline Pipeline. a 632-mile conduit that had carried crude drilled off the Gulf Coast northward to refiners in the Midwest. The reversal project. completed in January 2022. will at maximum capacity ship 200.000 barrels of oil per day from Illinois to Louisiana. Its initial shipments are  100% Canadian crude.  the pipeline s operator. Plains All American Pipeline. said in a November earnings call. Shipping oil by rail. no matter how you slice it. is going to be more expensive than shipping oil by a pipeline.  said Clark Williams-Derry. an oil analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. a nonprofit research outfit.  It is unlikely that oil by rail would be the first choice for Canadian producers to try to get oil down to the Gulf. because it s so expensive. But part of what makes it so costly is that every time a railcar switches to another company s tracks. it pays that railroad a fee. Since rail shipments are usually a  backup policy. almost like insurance if the pipeline system fails. or it s overloaded. or there s too much production.  he said the combined railroads could offer a cheaper route. What this does is make that second option more attractive and a little more beneficial to oil producers because they may be able to get it to the Gulf at a slightly lower cost.  Williams-Derry said.S&P GlobalmountingagainstIf those projects fail. or if legal challenges or activists disrupt the flow of oil through operating pipelines. then there would likely be an uptick of shipments by rail.The Surface Transportation Board s approval of the Canadian Pacific-Kansas City Southern merger is not guaranteed. The Biden administration has signaled greater skepticism of industry consolidation. and appointed multiple members to the five-person board with backgrounds in passenger rail.Indeed. President Joe Biden. known throughout his career as  Amtrak Joe  for his enthusiastic commutes on the Northeast rail corridor. has vowed to vastly expand the nation s network of passenger trains.op-ed opposing the merger.  After all. trains are the most efficient way to move freight. And those trains should be safe. full of people and not dangerous freight. Outside the Northeastern U.S.. Amtrak s trains use freight rail lines. and federal laws require passenger locomotives to get priority access. There s a lot of friction there because they don t mix too well. operationally speaking.  said Lawrence Gross. a freight transportation analyst and founder of Gross Transportation Consulting.  Freight trains are supposed to get out of the way. but freight trains are two miles long. so they re not agile. Compared to the lucrative cargo shipments. the passenger trains with only a few coaches  carrying 60. 70. 100 people  are  gumming up the works from a railroad perspective.  he said.While unions representing rail employees nearly crippled the U.S. freight system in a fight over working conditions. others in the labor movement have opposed a merger they say could reduce jobs at West Coast ports. The deal would  greatly harm our maritime and industrial labor by diverting the cargo coming through our US ports in favor of Canadian ports.  United Steelworkers Local 592 President Jared Moe told Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) in a February 2022 letter. This will ultimately cost much of our community their livelihoods.  he said.Warning that the merger would mean Canadian Pacific decamps from its Minneapolis headquarters for Kansas City. Missouri. Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) urged the Surface Transportation Board Chairman Martin Oberman to  strongly consider  the  potential negative economic impacts on our community  in a letter sent earlier this month.Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) said in a five-page letter to the board:  The proposed merger represents a grave threat to competition in the domestic rail industry. which is already highly consolidated. It would likely lead to job losses. harm to other industries reliant on railroads. and more fragility in American supply chain infrastructure. Perhaps unsurprisingly. rival Class 1 railroads have raised objections to the deal. But  while there s the feeling that if you had a combination of two of these giants. it would create a behemoth that others would have to match.  ending up  with just two or three railroads in North America.  Gross said the merger would allow two of the smallest companies to compete in a system already dominated by bigger giants. You could make the case that this is bringing the system more into balance than it was before.  he said.The Surface Transportation Board held three days of hearings on the merger this week in Washington. D.C. On Friday. the regulator added another three days of hearings. set for next week.Whether the oil shipments will weigh on the approval is difficult to tell. If you don t have the pipeline and it makes economic sense. the stuff is going to move by rail. one way or the other.  Gross said.  This becomes more of a story of how it moves rather than whether it moves. CORRECTION: This story was updated to amend Bill Gluba s first name. ,Health News

During normal times. it can be difficult for Vince Quiles to find a manager at the Home Depot where he works in northeast Philadelphia. But that hasn t been a problem since Quiles went public with his effort to unionize the store last week.Employees have been getting called into meetings with supervisors and taken out to lunch like never before. Quiles said. I ve worked here 5½ years. and I ve never in my life seen this.  said the 27-year-old. who filed a union election petition with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. The petition is under review by the board. If workers at Quiles  store were to vote for the union. it would be the first of Home Depot s U.S. stores to organize. To prevent that from happening. the home improvement chain appears to be relying on a faithful tactic for employers: saturate the workplace with managers from near and far to discourage workers from unionizing. Starbucks has used the same strategy in its battle against Starbucks Workers United. dispatching managers to stores where workers are considering forming a union and holding individual or group meetings with them to weaken union support. More than 230 Starbucks stores have unionized since December.Quiles said he has received an unusual amount of attention from management in recent days. making it trickier to discuss the prospect of a union with his co-workers. They ve been following me all around the store.  he said.  Whenever I walk on the floor. I ve got a manager or someone from loss prevention following me around. He added.  I think it s very sad that Home Depot is not making an affirmative case for themselves. Asked about the influx of managers in Philadelphia. a Home Depot spokesperson said in an email that the company does  not believe unionization is the best solution for our associates.  We look forward to continuing to talk with our associates about their concerns.  the spokesperson said.  Our open-door policy is designed to assure all associates that they can bring concerns directly to leadership. and we have a track record of working successfully with our associates to resolve concerns.Quiles said he started the union effort because his co-workers have felt underpaid and undervalued for the work they do. especially during the home-improvement boom during the coronavirus pandemic. He said a union could force the company to address workers  concerns and thinks that management s response has already shown the value of the effort.Another worker at the store. who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. said the  flood  of managers went far beyond any normal  open-door  policy. The worker estimated that eight managers ― some from other stores. some who appeared to be from corporate headquarters ― had approached them in recent days to talk about the job and how the store might be improved.  Before this. I didn t even know what my district manager looked like.  the worker said.  Seeing all these people. I m like. ‘What s going on?  I was so confused. The worker said it was amusing to see a sudden surge of concern for how the store was operating. We ve all said it to HR ― we ve emailed them this and that. and they barely implemented stuff.  the worker said.  But once [there s talk of a union]. they want to tighten up and help us out. and start doing stuff for us.  HuffPost readers: Do you work at Home Depot and have thoughts on unionization? Email our reporter about it. You can remain anonymous.One manager explained how to revoke a union authorization signature. which organizers round up in order to get an election scheduled with the labor board. the worker said.Workers must obtain signatures from 30% of the proposed bargaining unit in order for a vote to be scheduled. Quiles said he got signatures from 103 workers out of 276 at the store. or around 37% of the workforce. Unions typically don t file for an election until a strong majority is onboard. but some recent successful unionization efforts ― notably the Amazon Labor Union s upset victory at a warehouse in New York City earlier this year ― began with a petition from a minority of workers.Quiles said he and his pro-union co-workers have chosen the name Home Depot Workers United for the would-be union. The group is not affiliated with an established union. A labor lawyer advised Quiles on the petition filing and will be training workers on how to spot unfair labor practices or labor law violations. according to Quiles.An election win for the union would put Home Depot in a category with other big-name U.S. employers who are no longer union-free. such as Amazon. Starbucks. REI. Apple and Trader Joe s. Home Depot says it has roughly 2.300 stores in North America.Although the Teamsters represent some Home Depot drivers in California. the chain does not currently have any unions in its U.S. retail locations. For years the company has required workers to watch anti-union videos as part of their job training. teaching them the supposed pitfalls of organizing.According to Quiles. management began holding group meetings for workers this week in a training room at the store. It s common for employers to hold such confabs during an organizing effort. with managers or outside consultants delivering talks aimed at undermining union support. Home Depot declined to discuss whether such meetings were taking place.Quiles said he did not personally sit in on any of the get-togethers. He said he suspected he was not invited because he was the one who filed the election petition with the labor board.,Business News
A Home Depot store in Northeast Philadelphia could soon become the home-improvement chain s very first to unionize. giving yet another boost to an energized U.S. labor movement that s tackling the retail sector.Vince Quiles. who works in the store s receiving department. filed a petition this week for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board. Quiles. 27. said he gathered more than 100 signed union cards from his orange apron-clad co-workers in a little more than a month. Labor unions have made a number of breakthroughs at high-profile. historically non-union companies in recent months: Starbucks. Amazon. Trader Joe s and REI. Quiles sees no reason why Home Depot shouldn t be next. We re inspired by Starbucks and Amazon — let us be the catalyst at Home Depot.  Quiles told HuffPost.  I know the people in that building. ... They aren t really being treated like they should [be]. with the dignity and respect they deserve. Quiles and his co-workers are calling their union Home Depot Workers United — an echo of recent successful campaigns like Starbucks Workers United and Trader Joe s United. For now. the effort is not affiliated with an established union that would have staff and resources to devote to organizing. Quiles said he got some legal advice from a pro bono lawyer and did the card-gathering on his own. An NLRB employee in Philadelphia had to sit him down for about an hour and a half to explain the paperwork he would need to file and how the unionization process would work. She was extremely helpful.  said Quiles. who has been working at Home Depot for five years.  I was flying by the seat of my pants.  Although union membership is hovering near a historic low. U.S. employers are contending with an organizing wave at the moment. The labor board saw a 58% increase in union election petitions in the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year when compared to the same period the previous year. The tight labor market has shifted more bargaining power to workers. while the pandemic has undoubtedly altered the way many of them view their jobs.Quiles. the father of a 1-year-old. says many of his co-workers grew to feel unvalued.  I don t think we re unique in this experience. I felt like the pandemic just highlighted the dynamic that we knew was there. but maybe people didn t want to acknowledge.  he said.  Who wants to acknowledge that people don t really respect you and all you re looked at is a means to an end? Home Depot did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.representThe company has a long history of resisting organizing efforts and subjecting workers to anti-union talking points. Quiles is an underdog by any measure: He acknowledged he has no formal organizing experience and that many co-workers who could be supportive are scared of how their employer will respond.But the Amazon Labor Union s upset election victory at the JFK8 warehouse in New York City earlier this year made longshot organizing efforts seem more viable. Quiles said he s been in touch with the ALU s president. Chris Smalls. a former Amazon worker who was fired by the company after leading a protest over safety.The two campaigns share at least one thing in common so far: In both instances. workers requested a union election before they secured a clear majority of support through union cards. Workers only need signatures from 30% of the workplace for the labor board to greenlight an election. But typically. a union wants to have a supermajority onboard before filing under the assumption the company will unleash an anti-union campaign that peels off supporters. In the election. the union will need to win a majority of the votes cast to become the workers  representative. The Home Depot store has an estimated 276 workers. and Quiles says he got cards from a little under 40%. meaning plenty more organizing work lies ahead. (The Philadelphia Inquirer first reported how many workers had signed.) Quiles said he moved forward when he did because he wanted to demonstrate as soon as possible to skeptical co-workers that the campaign was real.  Once you all [journalists] started hitting me up and the corporate people came into the store. everyone was like.  Holy shit. this is the real deal.   he said.A company in Home Depot s situation would typically put together an aggressive counter-campaign as soon as possible. That might include what are known as  captive audience  meetings where either managers or outside consultants try to persuade workers to vote against the union. Supervisors also tend to pull workers off the floor for one-on-one conversations to gauge where they stand on the union and how they might be nudged into the  no  column.Before an election can be scheduled. the labor board must certify that Home Depot Workers United rounded up a sufficient showing of interest through union cards. In the meantime. Quiles said the lawyer he s working with is training him and his co-workers on how to spot unfair labor practices in case Home Depot steps over legal lines to combat the organizing campaign. Whether the union effort succeeds or fails. Quiles said he hopes it changes the job for the better. People come in and bust their ass. They work really hard. and it s been a struggle during the pandemic.  he said.  Whatever happens. [Home Depot is] going to take us seriously and they re going to respect the people in that building more.  ,Business News
NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart and Target plan to begin offering deals and price matching offers earlier this year to keep up with Americans pressed by soaring inflation and looking for ways to ease the potential sting of holiday shopping.For two years now. shoppers have started preparing for the holidays early but last year it was because the global supply chain had been scrambled as nations began to emerge from the pandemic. This year. experts believe it is a rapid rise in prices. also tied to pandemic stricken economies. that will drive Americans to shop early to avoid prices that they believe could rise even further and to spread out the spending as they pay more for gasoline. food. and just about everything else.The holiday sales strategies. announced on Thursday. come amid what is expected to be slower holiday sales growth compared with a year ago. AlixPartners. the global consulting firm. forecasts that holiday sales will be up anywhere from 4% to 7%. far below last year s growth of 16%. The current inflation rate of 8.3% means retailers would see a decrease in real sales.Walmart. the nation s largest retailer. is also expanding the window for returns by more than a month. Gift returns will now be accepted between Oct. 1 and Jan. 31. compared with last year s return window of Nov. 1 to Jan. 24. the company said.Walmart. based in Bentonville. Arkansas. is offering a wider assortment of items this year with more new brands and more Walmart-exclusives than a year ago. according to Tom Ward. the company s chief e-commerce officer. The company is deepening discounts on such items as toys. home goods. electronics and beauty. It said that more than half the toys on Walmart s list of expected hot holiday toys are under $50 – with many under $25 — and nearly all of the toys are available to shop now or through pre-order on walmart.com.Target. based in Minneapolis. said will begin offering holiday deals between Oct. 6 and Oct. 8. a few days earlier than a year ago and it will begin price matching then. also a couple days early.Target has one of the most generous price-matching offers in retail. countering offers from more than two dozen other stores. That also applies to purchases at Target.com.Target plans to hire up to 100.000 seasonal employees in stores and distribution centers this holiday season. in line with a year ago.cautious hiring approachLast year. Walmart said it would hire roughly 150.000 new U.S. store workers. most of them permanent. full-time positions. on top of 20.000 permanent distribution and warehouse workers as the pandemic disrupted supply chains.,Business News
TrumpThe move came after an investigation conducted at the bank board s request determined that Mauricio Claver-Carone violated ethics rules by favoring a top aide with whom he had a romantic relationship. according to a report obtained by The Associated Press.The recommendation to remove Claver-Carone came in a closed-door meeting of the bank s 14 executive directors. according to the person. who insisted on not being quoted by name. The ultimate decision to fire Claver-Carone now rests with the finance officials who sit on the Board of Governors representing all 48 of the bank s member nations.Among those pushing for Claver-Carone s removal is the Biden administration. which said it was troubled by Claver-Carone s refusal to fully cooperate with an independent probe. His creation of a climate of fear of retaliation among staff and borrowing countries has forfeited the confidence of the Bank s staff and shareholders and necessitates a change in leadership.  a Treasury Department spokesperson said.Claver-Carone remained defiant in the aftermath of the vote. saying in a statement that replacing him would embolden China. which joined the bank during the Obama administration. It s shameful the U.S. commented to the press before notifying me and that it is not defending two Americans against what is clearly fabricated information.  he said.The AP obtained the confidential investigative report by a law firm hired by the bank s board to look into an anonymous complaint of misconduct against Claver-CaroneInvestigators said it is reasonable to conclude he carried on a relationship with his chief of staff since at least 2019. when both held senior positions on the National Security Council. They said the purported relationship prompted one U.S. official at the time to warn that it posed a counterintelligence risk.Exhibit A in the 21-page report is a  contract  that the two purportedly drew up on the back of a place mat in the summer of 2019 while they dined at a steakhouse in Medellin. Colombia. Both were there attending the annual meeting of the Organization of American States.In it. they allegedly outline a timeline for divorcing their spouses and getting married. There is also a  breach clause  stating that any failure to fulfill the terms would bring  sadness and heartbreak  that could only be mitigated by  candlewax and a naughty box  from an oceanfront hotel in Claver-Carone s native Miami. We deserve absolute happiness. May only God part w/ this covenant.  according to the contract. a photo of which was provided to investigators by the woman s former husband. who told investigators he found the place mat in her purse when she returned from the trip.The purported contract is one of several details in the report that have Claver-Carone fighting to save his job. They include allegations he had a 1 a.m. hotel room rendezvous with his chief of staff. sent her a poem on a Sunday morning titled  My Soul is in a Hurry  and — perhaps most troubling — awarded her 40% pay raises in violation of the bank s conflict-of-interest policies.denouncing the manner in which the review was conductedAccording to investigators. he has denied ever having — now or before — a romantic relationship with his longtime right hand.His chief of staff denied the allegations in the anonymous complaint and told investigators she never violated the IDB s code of ethics. the report said. In a written submission to investigators. she also complained that she had been denied due process.The AP isn t naming Claver-Carone s aide because the report. which is labeled  confidential.  hasn t been made public.statementa generous pay raise for his girlfriendThe Inter-American Development Bank is the biggest multilateral lender to Latin America. disbursing as much as $23 billion every year in efforts to alleviate poverty in the region.The U.S. is the largest shareholder in the Washington-based bank and some inside the White House have made no secret of their dislike for Claver-Carone. whose election as IDB chief in the final months of the Trump presidency broke with tradition that a Latin American head the bank.Some of the more salacious claims referenced in the report could not be substantiated by New York-based Davis Polk. The law firm also found no evidence that Claver-Carone knowingly broke the bank s travel policies to cover up a romantic relationship. or retaliated against any bank employees. as was alleged in an anonymous complaint sent in March to the bank s board.Still. Davis Polk harshly criticized Claver-Carone and his chief of staff for failing to cooperate fully with their investigation — considering it a violation of bank policies and principles.For example. the report said Claver-Carone failed to hand over his bank-issued mobile phone for analysis although he did provide a forensic report conducted by a consultant. Claver-Carone also didn t share messages from his personal phone or Gmail account with his chief of staff. the report said. Particularly in light of their failure to cooperate. it would be reasonable to conclude that the evidence of a prior relationship. and the additional circumstantial evidence of a current relationship while they were both at the Bank. constitute a violation of the applicable Bank policies.  the report said.Davis Polk s report said Claver-Carone raised his aide s pay by 40% within a year. It said that one of the raises and a change of title was ordered by Claver-Carone a day after an email exchange in which she complained about not getting sufficient respect from her co-workers. You figure it out. It s your bank.  she wrote. according to the report.Davis Polk. which also conducted the investigation that led to Andrew Cuomo s resignation as governor of New York. faulted Claver-Carone for making employment decisions about someone with whom it believes he had been romantically involved. However. it said that other executives received similarly-sized increases and his chief of staff s current salary of $420.000 is in line with her predecessor s compensation.Claver-Carone when confronted with photographs of the purported place mat  contract  during an interview this month told investigators that he had never seen the document and denied it was his handwriting or signature. He stated that the document was fraudulent and part of a scheme by his aide s ex-husband to harm her.In a letter to the bank s general counsel. seen by AP. divorce lawyers for the chief of staff said her former husband had a history of cruelty and revenge that was raised in divorce proceedings. They said any evidence he supplied investigators should not be deemed credible.FBI___AP writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report from Washington.___Joshua Goodman on Twitter: @APJoshGoodman,Business News
Carif the railroads and unions can t settle their differencesHere s how some industries are gauging the potential impacts and getting ready for the possible work stoppage.___AUTO INDUSTRYNearly all new vehicles that travel more than a couple hundred miles from the factory to their destination are shipped by rail because it s more efficient. said Michael Robinet. an executive director for S&P Global Mobility. So it s almost a certainty that new vehicles coming to the U.S. from Mexico or other countries will be delayed. he said. It s not like there s extra truck capacity to take all the vehicles that the railroads can t carry.  Robinet said.Automakers might be hampered in building vehicles. too. because some larger parts and raw materials are transported by rail. But Robinet said automakers will go to great lengths to get the parts to keep their factories running as much as possible.Mike Austin. senior mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research. said the strike could make new vehicles even more scarce. driving prices up beyond current record levels. That could raise inflation  as other goods aren t moving through the rails. Carlos Tavares. CEO of Stellantis. said Wednesday at the Detroit auto show that his company will wind up apologizing to customers because their orders may not arrive on time.___COMMUTINGMetra commuter rail service. which operates in the Chicago area. said Wednesday that it would suspend operations on four of its 11 lines on Friday if a work stoppage occurs. Some disruption on those lines would begin after rush hour Thursday night. In Minnesota. the operators of a commuter rail line that carries workers along a densely populated corridor from Minneapolis to northwestern suburbs and towns warned that service could be suspended as early as Friday.In the Puget Sound region of Washington state. any strike would cancel the rail service until employees return to work. said David Jackson. a spokesman for the regional transit agency Sound Transit. Some Caltrain riders in the San Francisco Bay Area could be impacted by a rail strike. officials said.The Maryland Transit Administration warned this week that a strike would mean the immediate suspension of service on two of its three MARC commuter rail lines.Amtrak. meanwhile. said that starting Thursday. all its long-distance trains are canceled to avoid possible passenger disruptions while en route.___ENERGYA strike could have a significant impact on the energy industry. and could hurt consumers who would likely end up paying more for gasoline. electricity and natural gas. Refineries might have to halt production if they can t get the deliveries they need. or if they don t have access to rail to ship gasoline.No one wants to risk leaving flammable chemicals stranded on the railroad tracks if a strike occurs. That s why railroads began curtailing shipments of hazardous materials on Monday to protect that dangerous cargo.Roughly 300.000 barrels of crude oil move by rail each day. which could supply about two mid-size refineries. according to AFPM. And about 5 million barrels of propane. representing a third of U.S. consumption. are moved by rail monthly. the group said.Roughly 70% of ethanol produced in the U.S. is shipped by rail. and ethanol accounts for about a tenth of U.S. gasoline volume. according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Nearly 75% of the coal moved to electric utilities in the first half of 2022 was moved by rail. the group said.___AGRICULTURELivestock producers could see problems almost immediately if shipments of feed abruptly ended. according to the National Grain and Feed Association.Meat and poultry groups noted the reliance on rail for shipments of feed and called for a quick resolution of the rail dispute. Every week. the nation s chicken industry receives about 27 million bushels of corn and 11 million bushels of soybean meal to feed chickens. said Tom Super. senior vice president of the National Chicken Council.___RETAILExperts say retailers have been shipping goods earlier in the season in recent months as a way to protect themselves from potential disruptions. But this buffer will only slightly minimize the impact from a railroad strike. which is brewing during the critical holiday shipping season. said Jesse Dankert. vice president of supply chain at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. a retail trade group that counts more than 200 retailers like Best Buy as its members. She noted that retailers are already feeling the impact from the uncertainty as some freight carriers are limiting services.Dankert noted that retailers. noticing a slowdown in shipments. are now making contingency plans like turning to trucks to pick up some of the slack and making plans to use some of the excess inventory that it has in its distribution centers.But she noted that there are not enough trucks and drivers to meet their needs. That scarcity will only drive up costs and make inflation worse. she said. As we have seen in the past two and half years. if there is a breakdown anywhere along the supply chain. one link falters. you see that ripple effect pretty quickly and those effects just spread from there.  Dankert said.,Business News
Joe Bidenelectric vehiclesthe Detroit auto showthe huge new climate. tax and health care lawThe Democratic president. who recently took a spin in his pine-green 1967 Stingray with Jay Leno for a segment on CNBC s  Jay Leno s Garage.  hopped into the driver seat of a bright orange Chevrolet Corvette Z06 — which starts at $106.000 and is not an EV —and fired up its engine. alongside GM CEO Mary Barra. He says he s driving home.  she joked.Biden then toured the new electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. marveling with Ford executive chairman Bill Ford at the model s performance.  It s amazing the speed.  Biden said. adding.  Does it have a launch button?  He also explored less-flashy vehicles. like Ford s all-electric E-Transit van and F-150 truck.Biden finally got behind the wheel of a Cadillac Lyriq all electric SUV. which starts at $63.000. briefly driving it down an aisle in the blue-carpeted hall. It marked a rare occasion to drive — albeit at little more than a walking pace — for the president. who typically is transported in armored U.S. Secret Service vehicles when out in public. Jump in.

Biden was to announce approval of the first $900 million in infrastructure money to build EV chargers across 53.000 miles of the national highway system in 35 states.for a new federal tax credit of up to $7.500Passage of the measure set off a scramble by automakers to speed up efforts to find North American-made batteries and battery minerals from the U.S.. Canada or Mexico to make sure EVs are eligible for the credit.In April. Ford started building electric pickup trucks at a new Michigan factory. General Motors has revamped an older factory in Detroit to make electric Hummers and pickups.Long before legislators reached a compromise on the legislation. each company announced three EV battery factories. all joint ventures with battery makers. A GM battery plant in Warren. Ohio. has already started manufacturing. A government loan announced in July will help GM build its battery factories.Ford said last September it would build the next generation of electric pickups at a plant in Tennessee. and GM has announced EV assembly plants in Lansing. Michigan. Spring Hill. Tennessee. and Orion Township. Michigan. In May. Stellantis. formerly Fiat Chrysler. said it would build another joint venture battery factory in Indiana. and it has announced a battery plant in Canada.Hyundai announced battery and assembly plants in May to be built in Georgia. and Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced factories in North Carolina in July. Honda and Toyota both announced U.S. battery plants after the act was passed. but they had been planned for months.Biden has been talking for a long time about the importance of building a domestic EV supply chain. and that may have prodded some of the companies to locate factories in the U.S. But it s also advantageous to build batteries near where EVs will be assembled because the batteries are heavy and costly to ship from overseas.rolling out more affordable electric optionsThe Equinox checks the North American assembly box. It will be made in Mexico. The company won t say where the battery will be made but it is working on meeting the other criteria for getting the tax credit.___Krisher reported from Detroit.

Consumers have been struggling with high inflation over the past year. with the Federal Reserve determined to rein in the economy.told CNBC s SelectWhile inflation is now showing signs of easing. it is still unclear how long this downward trend will continue.HuffPost spoke to four economy experts to make sense of the challenge facing the Fed and what s next for the U.S. economy.according to the International Monetary FundThe Federal Reserve looks at the Consumer Price Index and the labor market to make an assessment on inflation.Analysts survey households to assess the cost of living for the average family. The CPI tracks the cost of commonly bought items for a household over a base year. In the U.S.. mortgages and rents are weighted highly in this index. according to the IMF.The percentage change in the CPI over a set period of time is one of the most common ways to measure inflation.announcedHowever. Christelle Khalaf. associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois Chicago. said the so-called Core CPI. which does not account for food and energy prices. which tend to be volatile. is a more accurate measure of inflation.rosesmaller than in April. May or Juneaccording to CNBCKhalaf said the August metric is also expected to demonstrate inflation is easing.Investors and analysts are therefore pondering whether the price of goods and services has already reached its highest level — peak inflation — and will continue trending downward.Khalaf explained there are still plenty of unknowns about the price trajectory of items making up the Core CPI that helps economists calculate inflation. For example. you have the Inflation Reduction Act on one hand. which is expected to lower health care costs. which would subsequently contribute to reducing inflation.  Khalaf said.  On the other hand. the increase in rents is still surging and is expected to keep pushing inflation upwards. according to BloombergAnother factor complicating the picture on inflation is the job market. While a strong job market shows the resilience of the U.S. economy. it could also contribute to inflation through wage growth. and is therefore watched closely by the Fed.according to The Associated Presstold The Wall Street JournalAsked if the U.S. has reached peak inflation. Randall S. Kroszner. who served as a Federal Reserve governor from 2006 to 2009 and is now a deputy dean and economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. warned:  Likely. but Mr. Putin s actions could change that. according to The Associated Presstold Fox News concedes If China opens up significantly after COVID. there will be more pressure on demand.  Granholm said.  More pressure on demand means upward pressure on prices. Khalaf echoed Kroszner. saying the Ukraine war would also continue affecting energy prices. Expectations of a recession might keep oil and gas prices contained. but prices are not expected to decrease much further. especially with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the European markets.  Khalaf told HuffPost.Wholesale gas prices have been rising as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin s war in Ukraine as the continent tries to cut its reliance on the country for natural gas.That has created upward pressure on prices. though. as countries are left trying to secure gas from alternative sources.BBC explainsThis excess demand for gas — with limited supply of gas around the world — has caused prices to skyrocket. contributing to record-high inflation.Despite inflation slightly easing. the current 8.5% rate is still a lot higher than the Fed s goal of 2%.In late July — before the Labor Department announced the lower CPI rates — the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points. effectively increasing the cost of borrowing money. to tame inflation.Analysts still expect the Fed to continue rising its rates.told Barron sFed Chair Jerome Powell on Aug. 26 echoed Bernstein. telling the agency s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole. Wyoming. that price stability is one of the top priorities for the agency.While Powell welcomed July s numbers. he warned a single month s improvement is not a strong enough indicator that the economy has cooled down. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.  Powell said.  The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. Kroszner agreed with Powell s approach. The Fed needs to continue on its path to tighten monetary policy and bring inflation down.  Kroszner told HuffPost.But Julianne Malveaux. dean of the College of Ethnic Studies at California State University. Los Angeles. warned interest rate hikes  may not be effective.  describing the inflation situation as  fluid.  The Fed cannot control market forces. including supply chain breakdowns. labor market challenges. and other factors.  Malveaux told HuffPost.  They can only make their influence known by increasing interest rates. and this is a mixed tool. Powell also recognized that reducing inflation requires slower economic growth. which will inevitably  bring some pain to households and businesses.  These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.  Powell said.  But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain. Dedrick Asante-Muhammad. the chief of membership. policy and equity at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. said the Fed should not abandon its full employment mandate in its quest to tame inflation. I m concerned that we re going to try to combat inflation most disproportionately on the backs of middle-income. low-income people.  which Asante-Muhammad explained is  where unemployment levels matter so much. Asante-Muhammad added that the best way to combat inflation is to take money out of higher income brackets. I don t think people being able to pay their rent on time or. you know. buying healthier food are those that are really drivers of inflation.  Asante-Muhammad told HuffPost.Central banks around the world. including the Federal Reserve in the U.S.. aim to act as  inflation hawks.  according to the IMF.While the Fed is planning further interest rate hikes. it will still need to be cautious to avoid sending the economy into a recession. I hope that the Fed is not too aggressive in hitting the brakes on the economy. because in my opinion the cost of unemployment at the individual level is much higher and more scarring long term than the burden of slightly higher price growth than the Fed would prefer. especially as wages have remained subdued and are not the main driver of inflation this time around.  Khalaf told HuffPost.Khalaf explained unemployment can have far-reaching consequences on a person s health. well-being and lifetime income. but also their family. including their children s education and employment prospects.according to The Associated PressIn late July. Powell disputed the U.S. was in a recession. 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year. it doesn t make sense that the economy would be in recession.  he said. according to The Wall Street Journal.Kroszner said it will be the Fed s interest rate decisions — driven by inflation expectations — that will determine whether the U.S. avoids a recession. If inflation comes down steadily and inflation expectations remain well anchored. then the Fed may not have to raise rates so high as to push the economy into recession.  Kroszner told HuffPost.Asante-Muhammad added that apart from the Fed. it is also important for Congress to act to help the economy recover from the challenges of the past few years. and continue some of the benefits it offered during the pandemic.Malveaux agreed. calling for enhanced support. While many think the government has done enough — or in Republican terms. too much — to alleviate the impact of inflation and the possibility of recession on working people. I am among those who think that we must protect the most vulnerable through federally supported health and child care benefits. legislation that prevents wage theft. and more.

Starbucks The seven will get their jobs back after the Seattle-based coffee giant lost an appeal of a lower court s order to reinstate them.Starbucks said the employees violated company policy by reopening the store after closing time and inviting non-employees — including a television crew — to come inside.a federal judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate the workersStarbucks appealed. but late Tuesday. a three-judge panel for the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the lower court. ruling that Starbucks  did not show a likelihood of success  in challenging the lower court s ruling.in the ongoing unionization effort at StarbucksWorkers United. the union organizing Starbucks stores. celebrated the appeals court decision Wednesday.

We are concerned that this ruling sends mixed messages to our partners about appropriate behavior in the workplace and sets a worrisome precedent for employers everywhere who need to be able to make personnel decisions based on their established policies and protocols.  the company said.Starbucks also said the decision will penalize current workers. who will likely see their hours reduced to make way for the returning staff.,Business News

Americans have taken an increasingly positive view of labor unions over the past decade. with 71% now saying they approve of them in a new Gallup poll.That s the highest favorability rating Gallup has seen for organized labor since 1965.The affirmative view of unions comes amid a burst of workplace organizing at previously non-union employers. such as Amazon. Starbucks. Trader Joe s. Apple. REI and Chipotle. An increasing number of workers are filing petitions to hold union elections. and unions are winning more elections now than they have in nearly two decades.Approval of labor unions peaked at 75% in the 1950s. the same time union density was at its highest. according to Gallup data. At the time. around a third of all U.S. workers belonged to a union. Union favorability reached its lowest point on record in the wake of the Great Recession when fewer than half of those polled approved of unions. People s view of organized labor often goes up and down with the economy. Their favorability has been on an ascent since 2009.Liz Shuler. president of the AFL-CIO labor federation. which includes 57 unions. cheered the new findings. After a year of victorious strikes. record union election filings. and relentless efforts from corporate billionaires to silence workers. today comes as no surprise.  Shuler wrote on Twitter Tuesday.Around 10% of all U.S. workers belong to unions these days. and the rate is even lower in the private sector. at just 6.1%. according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those numbers track with Gallup s findings showing just 16% of adults surveyed live in a home where there is a union member. Gallup said that number has fluctuated between 14% and 21% since 2001.Unions have struggled to turn their numbers around for decades. facing political attacks from the right and aggressive anti-union campaigns from employers. But the atmosphere right now is probably the most promising labor unions have seen in years. Low unemployment and a tight labor market have shifted some bargaining power back to workers. while the experience of toiling through a pandemic appears to have made many workers more interested in bargaining collectively.Gallup s findings showed that Americans broadly view unions as important to  fixing our nation s broken workplace – where most workers have little power or agency at work.  according to a post from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute s Working Economics Blog. The pandemic merely exposed these decades-old anti-worker dynamics.  wrote Celine McNicholas and Eve Tahmincioglu in the post.  Clearly. as the new poll and recent data on strikes and union organizing shows. workers today are rejecting these dynamics and awakening to the benefits of unions.  Unions have notched historic victories in recent months. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. New York. delivered a stunning upset this spring when they voted to join the new and independent Amazon Labor Union. Meanwhile. the campaign known as Starbucks Workers United has unionized more than 200 of the coffee chain s stores around the country since December.The National Labor Relations Board says union elections petitions increased 58% through the first half of this fiscal year when compared to 2021. Gallup asked respondents what was important to them as union members. and the top answer was better pay and benefits (65%). followed by workplace rights and representation (57%). Forty-two percent cited job security.Despite the high approval rating. many respondents who aren t in unions told Gallup they were not eager to join one. A majority of non-union workers – 58% – said they have no interest at all in becoming a union member. Only 11% said they were  extremely  interested in doing so.,Business News

NEW YORK (AP) — It was the kind of story that media reporter Brian Stelter would normally sink his teeth into — if only it didn t involve him.CNNcancelling  Reliable Sources.

All mainstream media took a hit with the ascent of Donald Trump.  Costello said.  I really think he did a number on journalism in general. not just CNN. For a time we all played into it. and our reporting was kind of hysterical. CNN s tone had a lot to do with changes in the network s reputation. said Mark Whitaker. a veteran newsman and former CNN executive. CNN had higher ratings and more buzz under Zucker. but. Whitaker asked.  Was it worth it in terms of the way it changed the brand perception? Being seen as a liberal alternative to Fox News Channel isn t an issue for a news outlet that plays up partisanship. But for a company that has sold itself as an unbiased news source for more than 40 years — to viewers. to advertisers. to cable or satellite operators — that presents a problem.Since Licht took over. morning anchor Brianna Keilar s occasional takedowns of Fox coverage have disappeared.

And without it. if it all becomes advocacy. we don t have a civilized society. Licht has given few interviews to outside journalists since taking over. and a CNN spokesman turned down a request for this article.Licht has taken steps toward the goals his bosses have elucidated. He wants CNN anchors to be conscious of a perspective that they sometime talk down to people. He wants panel discussions to be informative. not dominated by extreme points of view. He wants to resist  outrage porn.

REI employees in Berkeley. California. have formed the outdoor retailer s second union. extending a winning streak for organized labor at largely non-union companies.Workers at the Berkeley store voted 56 to 38 in favor of joining the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in a mail-in election this month. according to a vote count held Thursday by the National Labor Relations Board. Employees at REI s store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City were the first to unionize earlier this year. As we have said throughout this process. REI believes in the right of every employee to vote for or against union representation.  the company said in a statement following the vote count.  We fully supported the vote process in Berkeley and will continue to support our employees going forward. The organizing success at REI follows other recent. notable labor victories at Amazon. Starbucks. Apple and Trader Joe s. all of which have seen their workers unionize for the first time in recent months. Labor officials have reported a surge in election petitions this year as more workers try to come together to bargain collectively.Bloomberg Law reported new data earlier this week showing that unions won 639 elections between January and June of this year. labor s best showing for the first half of the year in almost two decades. However. union membership is still hovering near a historic low. with a mere one in ten workers belonging to a union last year. according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.REI. which is structured as a customer cooperative. has more than 170 stores around the country. many of them in liberal urban centers where union support would be high. Given the success of the first two campaigns. the company may well face organizing efforts at other stores in the near future.The workers in SoHo organized with the Retail. Wholesale and Department Store Union. an affiliate of the UFCW. which will represent the workers in Berkeley. Both unions have a long history of representing workers in the retail. grocery and meatpacking industries.Having won their elections. the SoHo and Berkeley workers now face the more daunting task of trying to bargain a first contract. It can take years for workers to secure a collective bargaining agreement after successfully unionizing. and some never manage to do so. Although they are separate unions. the two groups may coordinate their strategies and demands with the company at the bargaining table.Most companies have been fighting these new organizing efforts. and REI has been no different. despite its progressive reputation. The company produced a widely mocked podcast earlier this year aimed at discouraging employees from unionizing (the episode began with Indigenous land acknowledgments by the speakers). The Berkeley employees created a petition calling on the company to  stop the union-busting.  saying REI was using  textbook  tactics to  scare  them. They ve told us our relationship with management will have to change. our existing benefits and retirement will go away. and a union representative will be required to attend our reviews.  the petition read.  They even told someone that they would need the union s approval to go on vacation.  ,Business News
A former head of security at Twitter alleged that the company misled regulators about its cybersecurity defenses. privacy protections and its ability to detect and root out fake accounts. according to a whistleblower complaint filed with U.S. officials.The revelation could create serious legal and financial problems for the social media platform. which is currently attempting to force Tesla CEO Elon Musk to consummate his $44 billion offer to buy the company.Peiter Zatko. Twitter s security chief until he was fired early this year. filed complaints last month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid. which is working with Zatko. confirmed the authenticity of a redacted copy of the complaint posted online by the Washington Post.attempt to back out of the Twitter takeoverShares of Twitter Inc. slid 5.4% Tuesday. Zatko didn t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. But he told the Post he  felt ethically bound  to come forward.Googlescam their followers out of bitcoinTwitter said in a prepared statement Tuesday that Zatko was fired for  ineffective leadership and poor performance  and said the  allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter. its customers and its shareholders.  The company called his complaint  a false narrative  that is  riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Zatko s attorneys. Debra Katz and Alexis Ronickher. said Twitter s claim about his poor performance is false and that he repeatedly raised concerns about  grossly inadequate information security systems  with top executives and Twitter s board of directors. The lawyers said that in late 2021. after the board was given  whitewashed  information about those security problems. Zatko escalated his concerns.  clashed  with CEO Parag Agrawal and board member Omid Kordestani and was fired two weeks later.The 84-page complaint describes a broken corporate culture at Twitter that lacked effective leadership and where Zatko said top executives practiced  deliberate ignorance  of pressing problems. His description of Dorsey s leadership style is particularly scathing. saying the Twitter founder was  extremely disengaged  during the last months of his tenure as CEO to the point where he would not even speak during meetings on complex issues facing the company.Zatko said he heard from colleagues that Dorsey would remain silent for  days or weeks.  Dorsey announced he was stepping down as Twitter CEO in November 2021.The disclosure says Twitter offered no monetary incentives for improving security and platform integrity. although the company did offer $10 million bonuses last year for top executives who could generate short-term user growth.Among Zatko s damning accusations of cybersecurity malpractice: Software and security updates were disabled on more than a third of employees  computers ― unduly exposing them to malware ― and it was common for people to install  whatever software they wanted on their work systems.  Such lapses are typically considered cardinal sins in cybersecurity.Whistleblower Aid said it is legally precluded from sharing Zatko s statement. The same group worked with former Facebook employee Frances Haugen. who testified to Congress last year after leaking internal documents and accusing the social media giant of choosing profit over safety.A spokesperson for the U.S. Senate s intelligence committee. Rachel Cohen. said the committee has received Zatko s complaint and  is in the process of setting up a meeting to discuss the allegations in further detail. We take this matter seriously. Sen. Dick Durbin. an Illinois Democrat. said in a prepared statement that if the claims are accurate.  they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world. Among the most alarming complaints is Zatko s allegation that Twitter knowingly allowed the Indian government to place its agents on the company payroll where they had  direct unsupervised access to the company s systems and user data. was found guilty after a trial in CaliforniaThe complaint said Twitter was also heavily reliant on funding by Chinese entities and that there were concerns within Twitter that the company was providing information to those entities that would enable them to learn the identify and sensitive information of Chinese users who secretly use Twitter. which is officially banned in China.Zatko also describes  deliberate ignorance  by Twitter executives on counting the millions of accounts that are automated  spam bots  or otherwise have no value to advertisers because there is no person behind them.Alex Spiro. an attorney representing Musk in his effort to back out of his Twitter acquisition deal. said lawyers have issued a subpoena for Zatko.  We found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.  Spiro wrote in an email Tuesday. Spiro said Zatko and Musk have not been in contact at any time this year.——AP business writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report.,Business News

Workers United. said the terminations were retaliatory.granted the injunctionWhat ultimately matters in such a case is not whether a worker violated company policy. but whether the company has a history of routinely enforcing that policy in comparable situations. Lipman didn t buy that Starbucks had such a track record.The labor board provided  evidence consistent with the theory that Starbucks discriminatorily applied its policies to the Memphis Seven when terminating them.  she wrote.  Specifically. the evidence offered supports inconsistent enforcement of the policies at issue. Starbucks must offer workers their jobs back within five days of the order. Lipman wrote. Starbucks said it plans to appeal the ruling and seek a stay. which. if successful. could delay the workers  reinstatement.The reinstatement is technically temporary while the underlying case regarding the firings is litigated at the labor board. But the injunction amounts to a legal and public-relations setback for Starbucks. The company has insisted it hasn t broken the law despite labor board officials filing at least 20 complaints alleging a litany of violations.The granting of the injunction also serves as a morale boost to the union campaign as it battles the coffee chain in both stores and labor board hearings around the country. Members of the Memphis Seven. including worker Beto Sanchez. posted on Twitter on Thursday to celebrate the judge s decision and thank supporters for standing with them:statement These individuals violated numerous policies and failed to maintain a secure work environment and safety standards.  the company wrote.  Interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies that are in place to protect partners. our customers and the communities we serve. A federal judge previously turned down a similar effort by the board s general counsel seeking reinstatement for Starbucks workers who lost their jobs in Arizona.Workers United has unionized more than 200 Starbucks stores since December in a remarkable burst of organizing. None of the chain s roughly 9.000 corporate-owned shops previously had union representation. The campaign that began in Buffalo. New York. has since spread to states across the country. while company managers have descended on stores to discourage them from unionizing.Workers at the Memphis store ultimately voted in favor of unionizing in June.The labor board s general counsel. Jennifer Abruzzo. has alleged that Starbucks has run afoul of the law by firing certain workers. closing stores and offering benefits to workers if they opt not to unionize. all of which the company denies. Abruzzo said in a statement Thursday that Lipman s ruling was a  crucial step in ensuring that these workers. and all Starbucks workers. can freely exercise their right to join together to improve their working conditions and form a union. She also urged other employers to  take note  that the board would vigorously enforce the law to protect workers  rights.Nabretta Hardin. another member of the Memphis Seven. said the reinstatement order  goes to show that Starbucks will do everything in their power to silence us.  We remain the only store to have organized in Memphis for fear of workers being fired like we were.  Hardin said in a statement through the campaign.  We hope this ruling brings comfort to our partners in the Memphis area and shows them the power they can have in a union. ,Business News
Workers at the Trader Joe s Wine Shop in Manhattan spent the last four months laying the groundwork to unionize their store. A small organizing committee met regularly to discuss strategy around building support to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. and they planned to go public with their effort the week of Aug. 15. But in the early morning hours of Aug. 11. Trader Joe s abruptly informed them it was closing the popular wine shop. its only one in New York City.Robert  Rab  Bradlea. a worker at the store and member of the committee. was blindsided when he woke up to texts about the closure last Thursday. Like three other workers from the store interviewed by HuffPost. Bradlea said he sees only one logical reason for it. They re hoping this dissuades other workers from doing the same thing we ve done.  the five-year Trader Joe s veteran said.Bradlea said conversations with coworkers had led the committee to believe there were at least 22  yes  votes among the 30 or so workers they expected would be eligible to unionize. They planned to have supporters sign union cards this week and quickly submit them to the National Labor Relations Board by Friday to petition for an election. Trader Joe s did not respond to inquiries from HuffPost on Wednesday regarding the closure. In a notice posted through its internal human-resources portal at 12:01 a.m. last Thursday. the company said it was  time for us to explore another location  where it could use its one license to sell wine in New York State. The company said the newly closed space would be  used to improve the overall operations  of its adjacent grocery store. Last week. Gothamist reported that the wine shop s sudden closure had caught its loyal clientele by surprise.Jonathan Reuning. another worker active in the union effort who has been with Trader Joe s for five years. described the store s hasty demise as  completely out of character  for the company.  It s totally to stop the union effort before it can begin.  said Reuning. 63.  My regulars are pissed. It makes us look really bad. It makes [the company] look bad to put their employees out of work like that with no notice. The UFCW told HuffPost it was  ready to pursue all legal action.  including filing unfair labor practice charges against the company for its  shameless union busting.  If the company retaliates further against workers involved in organizing efforts. UFCW will aggressively pursue all legal recourse available. and if Trader Joe s fails to meet their commitments to these workers. UFCW will make every effort to assist workers in getting jobs in union stores.  the union said in a statement.The company s notice to  crew members  ― that s Trader Joe s-speak for workers ― said they would be paid through Aug. 28. and management would be in touch regarding  the opportunity to transfer  to other stores. But workers from the store said they expect more than that. They are demanding Trader Joe s reopen the store. On a petition they ve created. the workers say the store was heading into what they describe as the busiest stretch ― the return of students and staff to the store s landlord. New York University. followed by the holidays. The company s decision to rent an empty space during their most profitable months simply does not add up.  the workers wrote. I assume they got wind of what we were doing.  said Anthony Small. another worker and union supporter.  I think they knew a lot more about what we were doing than we thought they did. The abruptness of it. it doesn t make good business sense. Small said he enjoyed his nearly eight years at the wine shop and was deeply disappointed by the way the closure was carried out. with some workers finding out as they arrived for work. They try to foster this family atmosphere. but it s really not there when it comes down to it.  he said.Maura McHugh has worked at the wine shop for three years. preceded by a separate three-year stint at another Trader Joe s location in New York. In an interview with HuffPost about the closure. McHugh said she was  done with the crying stage  ― but her voice started to crack as she discussed the shock of what happened.  Let s talk about transparency and best practices for closing a store. and the number one value: integrity.  McHugh said. citing a company line.  I just don t understand it. Even if it isn t about union-busting. someone made a very. very bad decision with this. McHugh. 53. said organizers first approached her about the union campaign only a few weeks ago: They had rightly assumed she was loyal to Trader Joe s and had  drank the Kool-Aid.  But she surprised them by saying she would vote  yes  for the union. She said the closure has only reinforced that intention.  If we had been in a union. this would have never happened.  McHugh said. shut down its entire businessMeanwhile. a workplace closure can be enough to make workers elsewhere tepid on unionizing if they believe it was a factor in the company s decision. Workers United. the union that s been organizing Starbucks locations around the country. has accused the coffee chain of shuttering stores on both a temporary and permanent basis to cool workers on unions. Starbucks has denied the allegations. but labor board officials have found merit in some cases and filed complaints against the company over them.Like other retailers. Trader Joe s is facing a burst of union organizing this year. Stores in Hadley. Massachusetts. and Minneapolis recently voted decisively to join Trader Joe s United. a new union unaffiliated with an established labor group. creating the chain s first organized stores. The UFCW. which represents hundreds of thousands of grocery workers around the country. recently submitted a petition for an election at a Trader Joe s location in Boulder. Colorado.Trader Joe s has not closed those stores despite active union campaigns there. Asked why the Union Square spot would be any different. Bradlea said he believes it would be less disruptive to the company s business to close a wine store as opposed to one of its grocery stores. He also surmised that the company would fear a wave of organizing in the greater New York area. one of its strongest markets.  It would make sense they have a specific vested interest in this region not beginning to unionize. and they were afraid of a chain reaction of other stores feeling empowered.  he said. The closure has left many workers from the store uncertain of their futures with the company. Bradlea said he dropped his hours to part-time when he started organizing back in the spring and would survive without his Trader Joe s job. Both Reuning and McHugh had full-time positions and hope to find transfers to other stores.Reuning is optimistic his manager will help him land elsewhere. He said the closure has only reaffirmed his desire to form a union at the company. The fix is really having to listen to people at the bottom.  he said.  Trader Joe s loves to be run by the top alone. I think they lose sight of the humanity of the people that are working there and the effects their small decisions make on a family. on health. on a paycheck… these things that are miniscule in the boardroom. ,Business News
Facing a nationwide unionization campaign. Starbucks has accused officials at the National Labor Relations Board of  tipping the scales  in the union s favor. and has asked that all mail-in elections for its stores be put on hold for an investigation.In a letter to the labor board s chair and general counsel on Monday. the Seattle-based coffee chain claimed that board officials unfairly swayed the outcome of a union election in Overland Park. Kansas. earlier this year. Starbucks says the officials helped workers submit their votes in person at a board office even though the election was to be done exclusively by mail.Starbucks also accused board officials of an  absence of neutrality  as they pursued unfair labor practice charges against the company. The labor board s regional offices have issued 19 complaints against Starbucks involving dozens of instances where union supporters say the company targeted or retaliated against them for trying to organize. including in Overland Park.The NLRB is an independent federal agency that oversees most private-sector union elections and referees disputes between employers. unions and workers.Kayla Blado. a spokesperson for the board. said in an email Monday that the agency has  well-established processes  for parties to challenge how elections are handled. The letter Starbucks sent Monday was not part of that formal process. since it was not a filing attached to a specific case.  The regional staff ― and. ultimately. the Board ― will carefully and objectively consider any challenges raised through these established channels. which include opportunities to seek expedited review.  Blado said.A hearing is scheduled Tuesday for board officials to hear Starbucks  objections to the Overland Park election. However. Starbucks asked that the hearing be put on hold  until there has been a thorough investigation  and the results are made public.Starbucks Workers United. the campaign that has unionized more than 200 stores since December. called the company s allegations and demands  absurd.  saying that it s now  in vogue for the losers of some elections nationwide to attempt to reverse elections by any means they think are necessary.  Starbucks is simultaneously claiming to stand for voter protections. and then asking that all elections be suspended nationwide.  said Michelle Eisen. a union leader and barista in Buffalo. New York.  This is hypocrisy at its finest. The results in the April election in Overland Park are still not final. An initial count showed that workers voted 6-1 in favor of unionizing. but there were seven challenged ballots that could change the outcome. The board sets aside challenged ballots unopened. then must determine the eligibility of the workers who cast them (for example. managers cannot vote in union elections).In the version of events laid out in Starbucks  letter. several Overland Park workers apparently did not receive their mail-in ballots due to a mix-up by board officials. The company says the union s lawyer flagged the missing ballots for a board official. who then arranged for workers to vote in person at a board office.The company said it wasn t aware of these accommodations. and accused the board of  collaborating  with the union to  increase the number of pro-Union votes. A Starbucks store in Buffalo was the very first to unionize late last year. In a matter of months. the union Workers United has managed to win 221 store elections. of which all but 11 have been certified as official by the labor board. according to data provided Friday by the NLRB. Forty-six stores have voted against unionization. giving the union a win rate of 81%. The union says the election data shows that  workers have spoken loud and clear. The union has accused Starbucks of violating the law throughout the campaign by closing stores. firing pro-union workers and promising benefits for workers who choose not to unionize. Starbucks claims that none of these moves were retaliatory. but the labor board s general counsel has found merit in many of the union s allegations and has filed complaints based on them. The charges are still being litigated.In its letter to the board on Monday. Starbucks asked that officials make clear to the public that there have been no official findings of lawbreaking yet. All existing unfair labor practice cases only involve allegations.  the company wrote.,Business News
It was a little more than two weeks ago that an upstart labor campaign. Trader Joe s United. won an election in Massachusetts to form the grocery chain s first union. But the independent group of Trader Joe s employees has already proven that the victory was no fluke.The union prevailed in its second election on Friday at a store in downtown Minneapolis. where workers  in favor of joining Trader Joe s United. Like their counterparts in Massachusetts. the Minnesota workers are calling on the chain to come to the bargaining table to hammer out a first contract.Trader Joe s has opposed union efforts inside its stores for years. but the back-to-back wins could encourage more of the chain s workers to bargain collectively. Organizers say they ve been hearing from Trader Joe s workers around the country and intend to unionize more of the grocer s 500-plus locations.Sarah Beth Ryther. a worker at the Minneapolis store involved in the campaign. told HuffPost ahead of the vote that pro-union workers were feeling more and more confident they could take on the company. We re talking to people all day long about this movement.  Ryther said.  I think it s just time.  Trader Joe s said in a statement following the vote count that while it was  concerned about how this new rigid legal relationship will impact Trader Joe s culture.  the company was prepared to start bargaining a contract  immediately.  Trader Joe s offers all of its Crew Members. across the country. an industry-leading package of pay. benefits. and flexible working conditions.  the company said. using its term for employees.  We are committed to responding quickly when circumstances change to ensure we are doing the right thing to support our Crew. Trader Joe s United is not affiliated with an established labor group. The workers have been doing the organizing on their own with an assist from lawyers helping out pro bono. The workers in Minneapolis linked up with the workers in Massachusetts in May after the latter went public with their campaign.The group s success so far ― like that of Starbucks Workers United and the Amazon Labor Union. both of which recently established the first unions inside those companies ― reflects a moment of opportunity for the labor movement at large after decades of decline. Only around one in 10 U.S. workers belongs to a union these days. down from around one in three in the years following World War II.Trader Joe s has a week to contest the results of the Minneapolis election. The company chose not to do so after the union s win in Massachusetts. saying it would promptly start bargaining with Trader Joe s United and was willing to use other contracts in the grocery industry as a framework.The U.S. retail space has been difficult for unions to organize. but labor has been making headway in recent months. In addition to Starbucks. workers have created the first unions at REI and Apple as well. Although unions have had a footprint in the grocery industry for decades ― the United Food and Commercial Workers union represents hundreds of thousands of store employees ― Trader Joe s managed to keep them at bay until recently. In addition to the organizing by Trader Joe s United. the UFCW has petitioned for an election at Trader Joe s store in Boulder. Colorado.Trader Joe s has long enjoyed a reputation for decent pay and benefits. but many workers have complained that the California-based company has grown stingier in recent years. Management quietly informed workers in January that the 401(k) contribution would be cut in half for workers with less than 10 years of service. a decision that many employees cited in their decision to try to unionize.Shortly ahead of the vote in Massachusetts. Trader Joe s told employees it would be improving certain benefits. including offering premium pay for working Sundays and holidays. The company didn t respond when asked by HuffPost whether the new provisions would apply to stores that had unionized or petitioned to have an election.Hannah Nybakken. who works at the Minneapolis store. told HuffPost ahead of the election that she viewed the improvements as a clear response to the organizing that s been going on. We were sort of shocked to see they were willing to answer so many of the things we had been looking at for so long. just by us saying ‘union.   she said.This story has been updated with comment from Trader Joe s.,Business News

Earlier this year. Sarah Beth Ryther and her Trader Joe s co-workers started talking in earnest about unionizing their store in downtown Minneapolis. They didn t know it at the time. but some of the chain s workers in Hadley. Massachusetts. were having the same hush-hush discussion 1.300 miles away.When the Hadley workers went public with their campaign called Trader Joe s United in May. Ryther and her co-workers immediately reached out to the organizers there. who were store  crew  members just like them. It became clear very quickly that we were experiencing so many of the same issues and had the same concerns. and wanted Trader Joe s to remain Trader Joe s.  Ryther. 32. told HuffPost.  We decided to join forces with them. Just three months later. this new. independent labor group with no real staff or budget has the company on its heels in an organizing battle. Despite pressure from management to reject the union. workers in Hadley voted decisively to join Trader Joe s United late last month. 45 to 31. making history as the chain s only unionized store. The workers in Minneapolis will be casting ballots in their own election later this week. with a count scheduled for Friday.A second victory would put momentum behind the young campaign and almost certainly encourage more workers to consider unionizing stores elsewhere. A third Trader Joe s union election may soon come to Boulder. Colorado. where employees are organizing with the United Food and Commercial Workers union. which has deep roots in the grocery industry.Ryther said what happened in Hadley is just the beginning. We re talking to people all day long about this movement.  she said.  I think it s just time. It s certainly an optimistic time for union organizing. Workers have notched a number of firsts in recent months: the first unionized Starbucks cafes. the first unionized Amazon warehouse. the first unionized REI retail store and the first unionized Apple Store. The federal labor board has reported a sharp uptick in union election petitions this fiscal year. as pandemic-weary workers come together to improve their jobs.The union efforts are still in their infancy at Trader Joe s. which has more than 500 locations around the country. but the chain could be ripe for widespread organizing.Workers at the Trader Joe s in Minneapolis said many of their co-workers are students or recent graduates of the University of Minnesota with left-leaning politics. Indeed. a lot of Trader Joe s stores are in liberal areas and probably draw a young and progressive workforce that may be predisposed to appreciate unions. That has certainly been a factor in the organizing success at Starbucks. which has seen more than 200 locations unionize in a matter of months.Hannah Nybakken started working at Trader Joe s in the summer of 2020 and graduated from the university the following spring with a bachelor s degree in product design. She now puts her education to use on two fronts: creating the handmade in-store signage that Trader Joe s is known for. and handling social media for Trader Joe s United.Nybakken. 22. said a union could make the job more stable and attractive for the next crop of employees. We have really high turnover … and there are a lot of college students that come here [to work].  Nybakken said.  They re aware they re only going to be here as long as they re in school. so building up this union right now is so important. That means the next time we get a wave of young students. they ll be able to benefit in ways I wish I had when I started. Ryther hopes a union could make the work safer. too. She said the police have been called to handle incidents in or near the store. including when she personally tended to a young gunshot victim who was shot outside last year. Ryther said she and others feel left to their own devices at such moments and would like more training. We want to be empowered to take control of the situation for ourselves.  she said.Trader Joe s has given the organizing efforts a few inadvertent boosts. like when it slashed the company s 401(k) contributions in half for workers with less than 10 years on the job earlier this year. The company has since announced some improvements to benefits. such as a $10-per-hour premium for working Sundays and holidays. which happened to coincide with the union push.Nybakken said managers have told workers in meetings that those benefits wouldn t be rolled out at their store while a union election was pending. (Starbucks has said it may withhold new benefits from newly unionized stores. saying it believes labor law would require them to bargain over them.) For Nybakken. the announcement served as validation of the union effort. We were sort of shocked to see they were willing to answer so many of the things we had been looking at for so long. just by us saying ‘union.   she said.Julia Hogan said one reason she wants to unionize Trader Joe s is to bring more logic to the compensation system. Hogan. 21. says she started working at the store about nine months ago. She already had some grocery experience having worked at a unionized Lunds & Byerlys store in Minnesota. but she said she was still surprised to see she was getting paid more than some of the Trader Joe s workers who were training her. It s very confusing. They re training me. They have the knowledge I need. Why are they not being compensated for their time?  Hogan said.  Nobody likes to train [other workers] because there s no real payoff for it. There s no thank-you from the higher-ups. Both Nybakken and Hogan said the message from management is that a union will make Trader Joe s more rigid and less fun. a common prediction made by employers facing an organizing drive. It s been suggested to workers that they would no longer have the flexibility to take on different roles at the store and work in different capacities over the course of a day. something Nybakken said she likes about Trader Joe s. The biggest threat is you ll be on the register for eight hours. or you ll just be in the wine shop.  Nybakken said.  I want people in our store to ask themselves why would Trader Joe s negotiate for that. if it s going to completely change the way the store is going to operate. They ve been saying a lot of things that don t make sense for the store s productivity. One of the reasons Nybakken and others preferred to organize with a new and independent union like Trader Joe s United is they liked the idea of starting something from scratch to suit their needs. The strategy has its downsides ― they are relying on pro bono lawyers to help them navigate the legal process ― but it also gives the company an elusive target since the union is made up solely of Trader Joe s employees and has no track record.It can be notoriously difficult for workers to secure a first collective bargaining agreement after they unionize. in large part because employers drag out the process and often bargain in bad faith to delay. Trader Joe s did not challenge the results in Hadley and vowed to promptly start bargaining. The company said it was willing to use  any current union contract for a multi-state grocery company with stores in the area … as a template to negotiate. But Ryther said she and others aren t interested in using the benchmarks of other agreements. After all. Trader Joe s regards itself as a notch above other grocery chains. Anyone who walks into a Trader Joe s will see that it s very different from other grocery stores. It s a unique beast in the industry. and that s how they ve made a name for themselves.  Ryther said.  We would like to hold them to their own standards. which is a much higher standard than other retailers. Correction: This story originally stated that employees had called the police to handle incidents in the store. It would have been customers who called the police.,Business News
Workers at a trio of well-regarded pizzerias in Austin. Texas. did something on Thursday rarely seen in local. stand-alone restaurants: They informed their managers that they intend to form a union.The workers from Via 313. an Austin-born restaurant group that dishes up Detroit-style pizza. have been organizing with Restaurant Workers United. an independent labor group formed during the pandemic. The union says it submitted petitions to the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday seeking to hold elections at the restaurant group s three sit-down locations in the city.Some restaurant workers are unionized in the U.S.. but they often work in eateries attached to hotels or other larger. unionized properties. such as airports. And while Starbucks baristas are organizing stores around the country. the Austin effort involves a different crop of food-service workers: bartenders. servers. hosts. cooks and dishwashers. I know how rare this is. I know the risk that it is. I could definitely get blacklisted.  said Ashley Glover. a bartender at Via 313 s store in the city s Oak Hill neighborhood who has worked in the industry for six years.  But I think it s a really beautiful thing to be a part of. Restaurant Workers United said it had rounded up a  supermajority  of support at each of the three restaurants. and that it intends to push for higher wages. paid leave and reliable scheduling. among other priorities. If the labor board schedules elections. the union would need to win a majority of votes cast in order to prevail.Via 313 could not immediately be reached for comment on the organizing effort. Founded in Austin by the brothers Zane and Brandon Hunt in 2011. Via 313 may be going national in the years to come. The Utah-based restaurant investment fund Savory took a stake in the company in 2020 with an eye toward expansion beyond Texas.The company has already had brushes with Restaurant Workers United. The group held a protest earlier this year saying workers felt pressured to go into work while sick. and called on the company to improve sick leave and COVID-19 safety protocols. Some workers who had signed a petition to management were suspended but later reinstated.Henry Epperson. a cashier at the Via 313 on Austin s East Side. said he hopes unions can improve the work in a field not known for collective bargaining. He said there s been an assumption in the industry that there will always be workers willing to withstand erratic pay and difficult conditions ― an assumption that s been tested during the pandemic as restaurants struggled to retain staff.  For years they thought they could just chew people up and spit them out and take on a new batch of people.  Epperson. who is studying history and sociology at the University of Texas. said of the industry.  But it takes a lot of skill to be able to do this job and do this work. We just really want to have respect and dignity for people that work in restaurants. Epperson said the campaign has ambitions beyond the pizzerias. The goal is not just to win at Via but hopefully win all over the place.  he said.  I m from Austin. I ve already kind of started talking about this with friends I grew up with who are in the industry. and they re very excited to hear about it. It s playing into this larger [labor] movement that s starting to take off again in this country. The Austin organizing drive is part of a string of recent labor campaigns run independently by workers. rather than by established unions. Such efforts do come with drawbacks ― these groups lack the staff and resources of unions that have been around for decades ― but they can neutralize a company s portrayal of the union as a  third party.  Independent unions have recently won historic elections at Amazon s JFK8 warehouse in New York City and a Trader Joe s grocery store in Massachusetts.Many labor groups have advocated for restaurant workers over the years. such as the worker center Restaurant Opportunities Center United and the Fight for $15 campaign funded by the Service Employees International Union. Those groups have played a crucial role in passing minimum wage legislation around the country and bringing attention to the struggles of workers in the industry. including harassment.But Restaurant Workers United is going a different route by trying to unionize workers through elections run by the National Labor Relations Board and then securing a union contract ― a process that for years unions have complained is broken. Ben Reynolds. an organizer with the Austin group. said many service workers seem eager to try right now. Even where there is big fear. they re thinking. ‘OK. it s worth it. let s give it a shot.   Reynolds said.  As we see with Starbucks. the election is not this panacea. but they can be a very useful organizing tool. If Starbucks [Workers United] hadn t won then they wouldn t have started this wave. It would be difficult to unionize the industry on a large scale in part because it s so splintered. made up of hundreds of thousands of individual. independent restaurants as well as major franchises. But trying to unionize a restaurant group would be one way to establish a presence in a place like Austin.Glover said the organizing campaign really took hold earlier this summer when the air-conditioning unit wasn t working at her store. making the kitchen even hotter than usual. She said workers in the front of the house like herself were bringing cold towels to their co-workers in the back. Savory doesn t care. They don t see you.  Glover said.  They see you as a number. man. Another thing in the system. Workers said Savory s ambitions beyond the city make it a good time for them to try to form a union at Via 313 s original stores. Savory is backed by the private-equity firm Mercato Partners. and Glover said she fears working conditions are already becoming an afterthought in an expansion of the brand. It doesn t matter if they re going to open 700 other stores. If the ones in Austin. the roots. aren t good. then it ll just be another shitty pizza place.  she said.  If they really do care about money. they would take care of us. ,Business News
BreAnn Scally quit her job at PetSmart in September of 2021. She had been bathing and grooming dogs at the retail chain s Salinas. California. store for seven months. and she struggled to get by in such a pricey area on $15 per hour. She left in search of better pay and less stress.But PetSmart wasn t done with Scally. The following January. she was doing one of her regular credit checks through Experian when she saw her new debt: She owed $5.000 for the cost of her training through PetSmart s  grooming academy.  as well as another $500 for the tools she d received for the job. PetSmart was apparently seeking to collect because Scally had left less than a year into a 24-month minimum tenure listed in the contract she d signed.After years of working to clean up her credit. Scally says her score dropped from the high 600 s to the low 600 s. enough to complicate signing a new apartment lease. She didn t know where she would find the money to pay the collection agency. IC System. I wasn t the best when it came to finances when I was younger.  said Scally. 24.  I had debt to my name that I was paying off. I had already paid off a lot of it and was doing well. Then this happened. Scally is the lead plaintiff in a new proposed class-action lawsuit filed against PetSmart last week. alleging that the company s training program is little more than a scheme to lock workers into lower-wage positions for an extended period. Worker and consumer advocates sometimes call these  training repayment agreement provisions.  or TRAP s. which require workers to foot the bill for training if they leave an employer before a specified time.Such agreements function a lot like noncompete clauses. which prevent workers from taking jobs at competing companies for a certain period. Training repayment provisions similarly compel workers to stay put. but through the threat of debt. Critics of these arrangements say they reduce worker bargaining power and hold wages down by precluding employees from taking their labor to the highest bidder in a free market.PetSmart declined a request for an interview about the company s grooming academy and its repayment requirements. but defended the system in a statement to HuffPost. saying other programs in the pet grooming industry can run up to $10.000. The company asserted that its average pet groomer has been with the company for 12 years.  Grooming Academy is a robust. multi-week program combining classroom and hands-on training. and is critical to maintaining our industry-leading standards.  the company said through a spokesperson.  Academy-trained stylists receive tools and equipment and 800 hours of hands-on instruction. more than any other program. and work with at least 200 dogs of all breeds and sizes.  new reportStudent Borrower Protection Centersuing more than 20 nursesJonathan Harris. an associate professor at Loyola Marymount University s Loyola Law School. says some repayment arrangements rightfully draw comparison to debt peonage and indentured servitude. The contracts can make sense in certain fields. he said. if they provide genuine training that has a value on the open market. accompanied by a degree or widely accepted credential. with a repayment cost tied to actual training expenses.  But the majority of the ones I ve been seeing. especially over the past few years. by far have not provided anything close to industry-recognized credentials or training.  said Harris. who co-authored the Student Borrower Protection Center report with Chris Hicks. Companies using them have  tended to be employers that didn t want to compete on wages or working conditions with their competitors. PetSmart advertises its grooming academy as  free paid training  valued at $6.000. Many PetSmart groomers certainly gain experience that they can take to higher-paid grooming positions elsewhere. especially if they rack up years of work in the salon. A separate question is whether the academy itself provides workers a marketable skill worth thousands of dollars that the company should be able to recoup through collection. Like many PetSmart workers. Scally started out at her store as a bather. cleaning dogs for close to California s minimum wage. Eventually she enrolled in the academy. which would put her on track to earn more as a commissioned groomer. She wanted to get the grooming experience in hopes of someday opening her own animal rescue operation. Scally said that her store was too short-staffed for her manager to offer much hands-on attention. She watched videos. filled out her workbook and tagged along with the manager in the salon. She recalls it lasting a couple of weeks. but PetSmart says it s a month-long program. Under the terms of the PetSmart program. Scally would remain on hourly pay and wasn t eligible for commission until she completed 200  supervised  grooms after academy. The 800 hours of training that PetSmart referred to in its statement includes these supervised grooms in which workers are making money for their stores.  I was really struggling just to provide for myself. to feed myself and put gas in my car on a regular basis.  Scally recalled.  It s not what I wanted for myself. Scally says the repayment provision was never verbally explained to her when she signed her contract. but she was aware of it and concerned enough to ask her manager whether PetSmart would actually come after her if she left. She says her manager told her PetSmart wants to make sure a worker produces the value of the training. so she worked to upsell clients on more expensive services and groom as many dogs as she could before putting in her notice. She even kept a log detailing the value of her production. I didn t think I was going to have any issue.  she said.The costs outlined in Scally s agreement were staggered so that she would owe the full purported value of the training and tools if she left in the first year. and half if she left during the second. The contract notes that the worker could end up on the hook whether it was a  voluntary or involuntary termination.  suggesting the company might charge workers it chooses to fire. PetSmart did not address whether it has guidelines to make sure workers understand the terms and that they could end up in debt. Scally s lawsuit argues that PetSmart is violating California employment law and consumer protection law through its grooming academy. It also asserts that if the grooming academy truly benefits workers. then PetSmart is operating an unlicensed and unapproved post-secondary education program. Scally is represented by the legal groups Towards Justice and Jubilee Legal. with support from the Student Borrower Protection Center. a nonprofit focused on student debt. Like a noncompete. a repayment provision can have its intended effect even if the employer never intends to enforce it. That s because many workers would rather not find out if the employer is bluffing. The fact that some workers like Scally are targeted for debt collection can be enough to create a chilling effect for anyone considering leaving before their two years have passed since completing the academy. PetSmart declined to say what factors it considers when deciding whether to pursue a debt. One worker named Sam. who asked to withhold his last name for fear of damaging job prospects. said he departed his PetSmart store a few months before his time was up. but only because his manager gave him  a handshake agreement that I was not going to be held to that two-year thing.  He left to go back to school.Because the agreement could theoretically be enforced on a fired worker. Sam said the provision discourages workers from speaking up about the pace and conditions at work. let alone taking more aggressive steps. like trying to unionize. It could chill you from doing basically anything.  he said. One worker in Texas. who wanted his name withheld to protect his job. has no such handshake agreement. He is only part-way through his two-year term and wishing he could leave for a better-paying job. Due to the time it took before he reached academy. the worker said he earned an hourly wage of around $12 per hour for close to a year before achieving the 40% commission that leads to bigger paychecks. After that. it takes another six months before reaching the 50% commission.He s still struggling to pay his rent and bills earning around $700 per week after taxes. He posts photos of his grooms to Instagram. drawing compliments and even job leads from others in the field. but he s afraid to bid farewell to PetSmart before he s fulfilled the terms of his repayment agreement. So far he s been unable to capitalize on the tight pandemic-era labor market. which has forced many employers to jostle for workers amid low unemployment. I really want to leave and go to a smaller company. I d rather work for a one-on-one groomer or a mom-and-pop shop. But I don t know if that s going to happen because I can t afford that debt.  he said.  I m barely scraping by on what we re making. Harris. of Loyola. said more employers may turn to these agreements due to the increasing scrutiny of noncompete clauses. which legislators have tried cracking down on at both the state and federal level in recent years. He cited a 2019 article in a roofing trade magazine that promoted repayment provisions as an alternative. suggesting companies threaten to recoup the cost of a trade association certification if workers try to jump ship to competitors. Some workers have fought back against repayment provisions by filing wage-and-hour lawsuits ― for instance. if the cost of the debt effectively pushes their earnings below the minimum wage. But advocates have pushed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to get more involved on the grounds that employers are turning workers into consumers of student debt. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra responded. launching an inquiry in June and soliciting stories from people who believe they ve been harmed. If Scally s lawsuit is certified as a class-action. it could benefit other current and former PetSmart workers in California. and possibly prompt more complaints in other states. (The company said it would not comment on pending litigation.) Scally said she still intends to open an animal rescue operation and has been taking steps to register one as a nonprofit and start seeking donations. She has no plans to return to PetSmart. I honestly wish PetSmart gave their workers more.  Scally said.  I feel like it would make us better groomers and do more for PetSmart. ,Business News

Two years after the death of Chadwick Boseman.  Black Panther  director Ryan Coogler is looking back at his final conversation with the late beloved actor. Boseman. who starred in the 2018 Marvel blockbuster as the iconic T Challa/Black Panther. died in August 2020 at the age of 43 following a four-year battle with colon cancer. My last conversation with him was calling to ask if he wanted to read [the script] before I got notes from the studio.  he said during the debut episode of Marvel s official podcast for the film titled.  Wakanda Forever.  which aired on Thursday.  That was the last time we spoke. He passed maybe a couple of weeks after I finished.  he continued. referring to the script for the film s sequel.  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.  Coogler recalled that the Emmy winner seemed  tired  during their phone conversation.  I could tell he was laying down when we were talking.  he said. adding that Boseman s wife. Simone Ledward Boseman. was also present during their call.  He kicked Simone out because he told her he didn t want her to hear nothing that could get him in trouble with his NDA. and she didn t want to leave. so I could tell something was up. Although the sequel s script was completed before the actor s death. Boseman declined Coogler s offer to give it a glimpse. telling him over the phone that  he didn t wanna get in the way of what direction the [Marvel] studio might have.  However. Coogler revealed.  I found out later that he was too tired to read anything.  Coogler added that. at the time. Boseman was planning his wedding to Ledward and said the Marvel star  asked about my kid  because he had missed the baby shower. The filmmaker then detailed his devastation when he learned about Boseman s death weeks later.  I was at my house.  he recalled.  I got a call from my manager Charles King.   He called and told me. and I didn t want to believe it. so I called Denzel. and I spoke to him. and we thought it might be a rumor. so I texted Chad. I was in denial.  Coogler explained. referring to Denzel Washington. who was a producer on  Ma Rainey s Black Bottom.  Boseman s last movie.  Everything about Chad was unique.  Coogler added.  How he lived and how he died was unique. Aside from playing the Marvel superhero. Boseman was also renowned for his roles in films like  42.   Get on Up.   Da 5 Bloods  and  Ma Rainey s Black Bottom.  for which he received a posthumous Oscar nomination.During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter last year. director Coogler opened up about working on the long-awaited follow-up without Boseman. It s difficult.  Coogler said at the time.  You ve got to keep going when you lose loved ones. I know Chad wouldn t have wanted us to stop. Instead of recasting Boseman s titular character. the film s writers. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole decided to include T Challa s death in the sequel s plot.The upcoming film will see the country of Wakanda grieve the loss of its leader T Challa as a new hero takes on the superhero mantle. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever  is slated to hit the big screen on Nov. 11.,Business News

LOS ANGELES (AP) — As the former captain in charge of the Hollywood Division of the Los Angeles Police Department. Cory Palka was a star himself.The towering cop with a telegenic smile hobnobbed with celebrities getting stars on the Walk of Fame. ran security for the Oscars awards show and even landed a bit part playing himself on the television drama  Bosch  about a talented but troubled maverick LAPD detective.But Palka s ties to the entertainment industry and his allegiances were under scrutiny Thursday after prosecutors said he leaked a sexual assault victim s confidential police report to the accused. former CBS leader Les Moonves. for whom Palka served as a private bodyguard for years.The LAPD said it was conducting an internal affairs investigation into Palka s conduct and the state attorney general was probing any criminal elements after a report said he conspired with CBS to conceal sexual assault allegations against Moonves.The report. which didn t name Palka. was part of a settlement announced Wednesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James in which CBS and Moonves. its former president. agreed to pay $30.5 million. About $6 million is going to sexual assault and harassment programs. The rest will go to shareholders kept in the dark while executives tried to prevent allegations from becoming public and at least one benefited by unloading shares before news broke.Weeks after the #MeToo movement erupted with sex abuse allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein in 2017. Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb reported to police in the Hollywood Division that she had been sexually assaulted by Moonves in 1986 and 1988 when they worked together at Lorimar Productions. the studio behind  Dallas  and  Knots Landing. A law enforcement official briefed on the matter confirmed that Golden-Gottlieb. who died this summer. was the woman involved in the leak by Palka. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.Jim Gottlieb said in an email to The Associated Press that he was  shocked and very disappointed  that his mother s report was leaked to CBS. He said his mother was never looking for money. she just didn t want Moonves to  get away with what he did  and was satisfied that her report contributed to his downfall. We would like to think the police are looking out for us. the victims. and not the perpetrators.  Gottlieb said.  This sounds just like what you hear about certain police departments being in cahoots with organized crime. Attorney Gloria Allred. who represented Golden-Gottlieb. said in nearly a half-century of legal practice. she had never heard of police tipping off a suspect to an investigation and said it could have a chilling effect on other women coming forward to report abuse. It s very. very disturbing.  Allred said.  It s really outrageous if they did that. And I have to ask. what were their motives if that. in fact occurred? Why were they. for example. trying to curry favor with CBS? Did they receive anything in return? Golden-Gottlieb went public with her accusations at the time Ronan Farrow reported on allegations against Moonves in The New Yorker in September 2018. Within hours of that publication. Moonves quit.Nearly a year earlier. the ink was just drying on her police report — which was marked  confidential  in three places — when Palka tipped off CBS. the report said. Palka then met personally with Moonves and another CBS executive.The New York AG s report said the complainant had requested confidentiality. It cited the California Constitution. which prohibits disclosure of confidential information to  a defendant. a defendant s attorney. or any other person acting on behalf of the defendant that could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim s family. The captain told CBS that he instructed police officers investigating the complaint to  admonish  the woman not to go to the media with her allegations. He also put CBS officials in touch with the lead investigator.CBS immediately went into damage control mode. with an executive alerting a member of the news staff to stay close to the phone because they  have a situation.  He told another staffer not to miss any messages and added:  I wouldn t bother you if this wasn t serious. When the allegations ultimately became public. Palka sent a note to a CBS contact saying.  We worked so hard to try to avoid this day.  He sent Moonves a note saying he was sorry and.  I will always stand with. by and pledge my allegiance to you. From 2008 to 2014. Palka had provided private security for Moonves at the Grammy Awards. which CBS produced.Jessica Levinson. a professor at Loyola Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. said a police officer has to adhere to legal and ethical obligations as a member of the force and can t violate those duties when providing private security. Typically. those two roles wouldn t be in conflict. The question is on a case by case basis as to whether or not it leads to divided loyalty.  Levinson said.  But the truth is. most of the time it really shouldn t be a tough call. Patti Giggans. executive director of the nonprofit Peace Over Violence in Los Angeles. said she expects the scandal to have repercussions that extend beyond victims being afraid to report assaults to the LAPD to advocates reevaluating relationships they have built with detectives.Palka. who retired as a commander last year after nearly 35 years with LAPD. said in his LinkedIn profile that he grew up with eight siblings in a low-income housing project in the Mar Vista community and had spent most of his life in Los Angeles.Video footage of Palka went viral during the racial injustice protests in Los Angeles in the aftermath of George Floyd s death when he took a knee with protesters on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.He was incident commander at the Academy Awards and  numerous high profile events related to the entertainment industry.  his profile said.In Hollywood. he was a frequent fixture on red carpets and at Walk of Fame ceremonies. posing with celebrities like Lynda Carter. Jack Black and Stacy Keach. He was personally thanked during Mark Hamill s star ceremony and posed with Hamill. Harrison Ford and George Lucas.The Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation s honored him in 2019 as one of the  Heroes of Hollywood.  Celebrity always equates to power and influence.  said attorney Debra Katz. who specializes in sexual-harassment law.  It becomes very troubling when you have a town of celebrities that have access to the police — when they have a dual role where they provide security and they hobnob with one another. Palka did not return requests for comment Thursday. nor did an attorney for Moonves and CBS.Moonves acknowledged having relations with three of his accusers. but said they were consensual. He denied attacking anyone. saying in a statement at the time that  Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me. The Los Angeles County district attorney declined to file criminal charges against Moonves in 2018. saying the statute of limitations from Golden-Gottlieb s allegations had expired.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

Perhaps we shouldn t have expected a biopic on  Weird Al  Yankovic to be anything other than a parody. Fans who were around in the  80s and  90s during his  Eat It  and  Amish Paradise  heyday especially know that spoofs are kind of his thing. But turning that shtick into a nearly two-hour movie that incessantly ridicules its very existence? It takes about 30 minutes to grow weary of that. after which  Weird: The Al Yankovic Story  becomes an unhinged freefall that aims for all laughs and exactly zero substance. Directed and co-written by Eric Appel. sharing screenwriting credits with Yankovic himself.  Weird  begins as your typical — read: too typical — biopic. We meet the parody musician (Daniel Radcliffe) as an accordion-playing child growing up in California and raised by a sheepish mother (Julianne Nicholson) and tyrannical father (Toby Huss). who oppose his interest in music and generally all his dreams right from the giddyup. Of course. it s that discouragement that fuels his eventual success. of coursestumbles My Bologna.  My Sharona. Fame and success — as well as a ludicrously fictional and toxic relationship with Madonna (Evan Rachel Wood). whose 1984 hit  Like a Virgin  he parodied with  Like a Surgeon  — contributes to his alcohol-infused maniacism and professional downfall. But not too catastrophically that the biopic can t obligatorily culminate with his incredible comeback. Yes. biopics often follow a template. and the drama is almost always amplified (or entirely made up. as it is in much of  Weird ). But doing a big-screen bit on biopics vaguely related to Yankovic s life and career. no matter how low that fruit hangs. just isn t interesting. Certainly not in 2022. when there s been such a complex conversation around comedy that it should easily open the door for a wider reflection on the enduring  Weird Al  phenomenon. even by the man himself.  White and Nerdy Maybe that would be better explored in a new documentary. one that expands on the principal biographical facts chronicled in the 1999  Behind the Music  episode on him. or a more objective narrative feature that Yankovic doesn t also write. Though. it s clear from  Weird  that the musician considers a lot of biopics to be clichés. Or. at least clichéd just enough for him to riff off them without actually addressing anything related to his artistry or motivations. That s certainly how Yankovic has navigated his work since the beginning. Daniel Goldmark. a professor and the head of popular music studies at Case Western University. considers it a key to the level of success Yankovic has had that surpassed any comedy musician before or since him. It s like. Let s take something that seems like a totally normal setup and then one screw is loose. figuratively speaking. and then what happens if we just keep pressing on that?  Goldmark suggested to HuffPost.  So. if that s the way you think about pop music and that s the way you hear things — Oh. yeah. what happens if… ? — And then you just sort of go from there. That is a pretty common understanding of Yankovic s accomplishments. That and the fact that while he doesn t legally need permission to record new lyrics over someone else s music. he always asks the recording artist for it anyway — underscoring his reputation for being a genuinely harmless and nice guy. And that everything he s done has been purely innocuous. Yankovic put it more succinctly in a 2017 interview with The Washington Post.  I don t want to hurt anybody s feelings.  Yankovic told the newspaper.  I don t want to be embroiled in any nastiness. That s not how I live my life. I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success. I take pains not to burn bridges. It is true that there is a difference between Yankovic and acts like Eminem or Blink-182. who more bitterly parodied pop stars like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys in the late  90s and early 2000s in songs and music videos. such as  The Real Slim Shady  and  All the Small Things.  There s an obvious cynicism in their music that just isn t there in Yankovic s. Still. considering the fact that Yankovic has made a whole career out of poking fun at everyone else rather incisively.  Weird  would have been a much smarter film had it made room for some introspection — even in his own signature spoof style. Like. maybe acknowledging that his well intentions overlooked the fact that a few artists. notably Black. declined his use of their songs in order to maintain their social and political resonance. Michael Jackson. who was otherwise obviously a fan of Yankovic s work since he gave him permission to parody  Beat It  and  Bad.  declined a spoof of  Black or White.  And Coolio very publicly took issue with Yankovic parodying  Gangsta s Paradise.  a truth that does make it into  Weird  in a caricature-like way. because his record label accepted Yankovic s request for permission without consulting Coolio. unbeknownst to Yankovic. (The two later patched things up. long before the rapper s death this year.) Prince also declined  four of Yankovic s requests to use his songs. It s admirable that Yankovic respected the artists enough to not move forward with a song they d declined. But it makes you wonder whether that encouraged him to gain an appreciation for social messaging in pop music. especially since parodying James Brown s  Living in America  with  Living With a Hernia  years prior in the  80s. But no such reflection or even a cheeky acknowledgment happens in  Weird.  It s clear that Yankovic has the talent to very wittingly mock popular music but can t seem to be able — or want? — to turn that critical eye on himself in this way. This is how a more objective screenwriter might have benefited the film. At the same time. though. there s something to be said about the fact that Yankovic s  80s and  90s hits remain massively beloved and you d be hard-pressed to find much cultural critique around his work in this era. His album  Bad Hair Day.  which featured  Amish Paradise.  was his bestselling album at the time. His music is understood as inoffensive and unquestionably easy listening. Fans certainly weren t having these conversations then. and. as Yankovic expressed in that Washington Post interview. he went out of his way to keep things light at all times.  There s still some stuff he doesn t deal with.  Goldmark said.  He doesn t deal with sex. I think. drugs. alcohol…. I feel like that s part of his image as the nerdy white guy. Nerdy white guys are square. which means they don t get involved in that kind of stuff. The professor thought about that some more.  I think maybe it gives him a way to focus on the stuff that he enjoys.  he continued.  Like. I m just going to stay away from those things. He doesn t deal with politics too much either. Although that can come in much more easily. I think. depending on the way people interpret his songs. Exactly. Because another way to look at it is that Yankovic merely capitalized off a long history of nerdy white guys — often protagonists in films like  Sixteen Candles  and  Revenge of the Nerds  — recentered as heroic in narratives that take large detours from reality. There s been enough distance from this era to really reflect on it more deeply without fans haranguing Yankovic for doing something in an era of which he was merely a byproduct. You could argue that Yankovic engineered his own life in an improbable way with a career that. in some sense. seems too unbelievable to be true. He s a widely revered. hugely successful pop star who doesn t necessarily fit inside the prototype of a pop star and who s managed to take shots without ever being on the receiving end. And maybe he co-penned  Weird  in that same fantastical vein. complete with an absurd narrative in which he victoriously contends with Pablo Escobar. Still. it leaves a lot to be desired. It would have benefited from some self-examination. for instance. By his own admission to the Los Angeles Times last month. he is  reluctant  to even do his parody music today. For instance. he s stopped performing  Eat It  because of the child molestation allegations against Jackson. Yankovic is cognizant of how the recording artists he s parodied view his spoofs as their  I made it  moment. so he will no longer give that tribute to those he now considers unsavory. But it s reported in the piece that he hid his most immediate reaction to the question of doing parodies today with his hand over his face. implying he might be a bit more conflicted about this. What he actually says is:  I don t rail against PC culture and all that because I think when somebody is accused of being politically correct. that usually just means they re being sensitive to other people s feelings. Fair point. But this adds a bit more texture to his own narrative. begging for something sharper and more trenchant than  Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.  ,Entertainment News

When Vanessa Ramos was first approached to develop a show loosely based on the last Blockbuster store in existence. it reminded her of doing improv back when she first started in comedy. It was a little improv style. like: ‘Here s your location.  As she explained in an interview. one of the show s producers. John Fox. had the rights to the classic video store s brand and image.  He was like. ‘I have uniforms and the signs and everything. and all you gotta do is build a world.  which — it s not a small thing — but I was like. ‘OK. I ll figure it out.   Ramos said.  My goal at the time was: If I can make them build me a Blockbuster. that s the end game. But who would fill that brick-and-mortar store. keeping both the movies in stock and the nostalgic memories alive? Ramos thought about building the show around a fictional store manager: Timmy Yoon (Randall Park). who. as we learn in the first episode. has worked at his hometown Blockbuster since he was in seventh grade ... and never left. I was like. ‘OK. who would be working at a Blockbuster in 2022?  They d have to not just love movies but have an emotional connection to the store.  Ramos said. It was the fall of 2020. and Ramos was living alone with her dog at the height of the pandemic. In developing Timmy s Blockbuster staff. she thought about the family and friends she missed. For example. one of Timmy s longtime employees. Connie (Olga Merediz). is based on Ramos  mom. Premiering Thursday on Netflix.  Blockbuster  contains many classic tropes of great workplace sitcoms. such as a sense of camaraderie among the characters. as well as topical jokes and memorable comic pairings. Park shares several uproariously funny scenes with J.B. Smoove as Percy. who is both Timmy s best friend from high school. as well as his landlord. owning the Blockbuster s surrounding strip mall. This naturally leads to some comically awkward situations. And like in many workplace comedies. there s a will-they-won t-they arc between Timmy and his childhood friend Eliza (Melissa Fumero). a new hire trying to restart her life while in the process of separating from her husband.The 10-episode series is Ramos  first time as creator and showrunner. But it comes from years of writing on acclaimed workplace comedies like  Superstore  and  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  (also starring Fumero). and perfecting the art of writing a killer joke. I was a very quiet kid and not the greatest at making friends growing up in Texas. So. I was home a lot and I watched a lot of comedy. primarily standup. and that s I think how I learned joke writing.  she said.  After a while. the rhythm of it clicked. But I wouldn t figure it out until later that that s a thing I had in me. After college. she moved to Los Angeles to intern at iO West. an improv theater and school. The position came with class credits. so she took an improv class. and then decided to try a stand-up class.  I went in the black box theater in the back and did my first stand-up set that night. I did five minutes and it wasn t the worst thing in the world. It was like. ‘OK. the scariest time is getting up for the first time and getting the words out.   Ramos remembered. She kept doing stand-up for about four and a half years. but discovered she was perhaps a better writer than performer.  I hadn t figured out my anxiety. So. I would get a lot of comics coming up to me. like. ‘Hey. you re a really great writer.  which is just like. ‘OK. you need to figure out the stage thing.  It put her on the map as a skilled joke writer. She started writing for other comedians when they were appearing on late-night roundtable shows at the time. like  Chelsea Lately.  That led to a meeting with standup comic Jeff Ross. who was developing a show on Comedy Central:  The Burn with Jeff Ross.   I had burned my hand on a Swanson s turkey pot pie the night before. And when Jeff Ross put his hand out to shake my hand. it was bandaged up. and I had to explain that I had burned my hand on a pot pie. because when it flips over. the innards get stuck to your knuckles. It was a whole thing.  she said.  So. he. of course. didn t hire me — as I would not have — with my pot pie burn.  Despite the pot pie fiasco. Ross fortunately recommended her for some other Comedy Central projects. leading to her first TV writing job on Comedy Central s roast of Roseanne Barr in 2012. She wrote for other Comedy Central roasts. as well as award shows like the Oscars and the MTV Movie Awards. and the Comedy Central late-night show  @midnight.  From there. she started getting staff writing jobs on scripted comedies. After having made joke-writing her bread and butter. it was on shows like NBC s  Superstore  where she started to hone her skills in writing a great story. My first script. you could not pay me to go back and read it. I think. story-wise. it s a mess.  Ramos said. But from watching  Superstore  writers Jackie Clarke (now one of her collaborators on  Blockbuster ) and Sierra Teller Ornelas (who went on to create Peacock s  Rutherford Falls ). she took note of how to craft a story.  It was kind of like a kid watching stand-up. It just clicked one day.  she said.  I just credit that show with teaching me how to really write a story. As she worked on different shows. she also saw the importance of valuing writers  time. which she brought to the  Blockbuster  writers room. A common practice on TV comedies is for writers to create a list of alternate lines or jokes called  alts.  which may or may not end up in the final script or filmed scene. Sometimes. actors try out the alts on different takes to see what lands best. But on the Netflix animated show  Big Mouth.  where Ramos was a consulting producer for a few seasons. she noticed showrunners Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg doing something different.  It was the first time I d seen someone where they don t just pitch a bunch of alts just to have. Whatever joke gets the biggest laugh. they d go. ‘Great. let s put it in.  because you trust your staff that they re funny and they know what s funny. And so. it saves you a lot of time.  she said. In my writers room. we work from 10 to 4. with an hour-and-a-half lunch break. So if you have an errand. you know exactly what time you re breaking and you can plan. You can have a work-life balance. That was very important to me based off of some of the experiences I had. Ramos. who has a development deal at Universal. initially pitched  Blockbuster  to NBC. which passed on it. before Netflix greenlighted the series. When Netflix announced the news. it was hard to ignore the irony of a show about Blockbuster being at Netflix. which famously began as a service to get DVDs in the mail. helping to precipitate the decline of the video store era. Luckily. Netflix executives never had an issue with the show poking fun at the streaming service. Ramos said.  I think we were all on the same page. It would have been way weirder to not address it.  she said.  I think I would have felt more sinister about it had we not been like. ‘OK. guys. we know what we re doing here.  One of the show s hallmarks is its wide variety of movie-related jokes befitting the store s staff. who would of course have an encyclopedic knowledge of the store s catalog. For example. in one scene. a customer needs a recommendation:  I m looking for a movie about a pig. but not Babe. It s too big a city!  Another customer. a substitute teacher. needs a movie to show his class instead of teaching. When he asks for  The Blind Side  or  Freedom Writers.  Connie directs him to the store s  White Savior  section. When you sit around and you try to come up with movies to reference. you d be surprised at the ones that float up to the surface. because they re not these Turner Classics that you think they re going to be.  Ramos said of the writers batting around movie jokes.  It s just like. ‘Oh. one time. I watched ‘Rush Hour 4  on a plane.  It s not even the first one you think of. We had a lot of fun in the room going through. like. ‘OK. what s the last movie you saw?  They were wildly different. For Ramos. it always comes back to finding the perfect joke. One of her favorite shows is  Detroiters.  co-created by and starring Sam Richardson and Tim Robinson.  They think of things that my brain wouldn t have thought to put jokes there. The biggest example I think about out the gate is in the pilot. where they re like. ‘Two beers.  [The bartender is] like. ‘Hot or cold?  … and they angle on the man blowing on his hot beer to cool it off. If I saw that script. I would not have thought. ‘Oh. that s where the joke goes!  I m just continuously fascinated by the choices they make there and just the funny stuff they find. Throughout  Blockbuster.  there s a similar joke density using visual gags for the viewer to spot. For example. there s a running bit involving the TV in the employees  break room. which is playing the local news. In different episodes. a different news anchor reports they are filling in for an anchor featured in a previous episode. who is on vacation. Jokes are where I really get excited. The story stuff I think is good and it s important. and I m happy that these characters are coming to life. But it feels like jokes is where I really get to play.  she said.  With jokes. those are the moments when you re making dinner later and then you just remember something. and it really cracks you up. Or there are lines that live rent-free in your brain. ones you might quote to your friends out of context. That s my dream.  Ramos said.  If I can get even one person doing that with the show. that will make me so happy. because I totally grew up as that kid.  Blockbuster  premieres Thursday on Netflix.,Entertainment News

Henry Cavill recently opened up about his reaction to discovering that  Twilight  author. Stephanie Meyer. thought he would have made the  perfect Edward  in the live-action film. Speaking on a recent episode of the  Happy Sad Confused podcast. the  Superman  actor admitted he wasn t initially aware he was Meyer s top pick to star as the high school vampire until after the first  Twilight  movie was made in 2008.  I didn t know about the movie.  the 39-year-old said in the interview. which aired on Oct. 26.  I didn t know about them wanting to cast me. and the internet wasn t quite the tool that it is now. and so I only found out afterward. In a blog post in 2007. Stephenie shared that she was saddened to find out that 24-year-old Cavill wasn t the right age for the glitter-skinned lead vampire. She wrote:  The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward. Henry Cavill is now 24 years old. Meyer revealed that she also had her eye on Tom Sturridge and Logan Lerman to play Edward. who she noted in her blog was  indisputably the most difficult character to cast.  Ultimately. then 21-year-old Robert Pattinson went on to score the iconic role in the romantic fantasy film alongside Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan. When asked if he was envious of Pattinson. who ended up beating him out for the role in the franchise. Cavill responded.  Not at all because I didn t know about the movie. I didn t know about them wanting to cast me...  He added. upon hearing the news.  I was like. ‘Oh okay. that would have been cool.  Based on Meyer s best-selling book series. the  Twilight  film follows Swan. who moves to a small town in the Pacific Northwest. She falls into a tumultuous romance with Edward Cullen. a mysterious classmate who turns out to be a 108-year-old vampire.Cavill revealed that portraying Edward wasn t the only opportunity he lost to Pattinson due to his age. The British actor noted during the podcast that though he didn t formally fight against Pattinson for the  Twilight  role. he eventually wound up battling him for the role of Cedric Diggory in  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   Yes. I remember that.  Cavill recalled.  I definitely auditioned for that one and did not get it. He admitted the role  wasn t right  for him because of his age at the time.  I think I was probably 19 or 20. and that makes a big difference when you re playing a kid in high school.  Cavill said. joking.  Well. it used to. anyway. Although he lost out on previous roles over his age. Cavill later starred in franchises such as  Mission: Impossible  and the DC Universe as Superman. Netflix,Entertainment News

egg yolk omelet frying panJames CordenRicky Gervaiswrote on TwitterDuring the opening monologue on  The Late Late Show  Monday evening. Corden poked fun at Elon Musk s recent acquisition of Twitter with a nearly word-for-word gag that Gervais included in his 2018 Netflix stand-up special  Humanity.  When you see Elon Musk talk about Twitter. he does this thing where he goes. ‘It s the town square.   Corden said.  But it isn t. because if someone puts up a poster in a town square that says ‘Guitar lessons available.  you don t get people in the town going: ‘I don t wanna play the guitar!  Well. then that sign wasn t for you ― it was for somebody else! You don t have to get mad about all of it. Viewers quickly called out Corden for directly borrowing the joke from Gervais  stand-up show. in which Gervais used an undeniably similar analogy about guitar lessons to explain his distaste for social media. That s like going into a town square. seeing a big notice board. and there s a notice ― ‘Guitar lessons  ― and you go. ‘But I don t fucking want guitar lessons!   Gervais said in his special.  Fine! It s not for you. then. Just walk away. don t worry about it. writingIn response to a fan who asked Gervais whether he d given his approval for Corden to use the joke. he wrote:  No. I reckon one of the writers ‘came up with it  for him. I doubt he would knowingly just copy such a famous stand up routine word for word like that.

NEW YORK (AP) — Embracing without permission. Disparaging one parent in front of children struggling with divorce. Flaunting privilege. Being a bad listener or. worse. a terrible loser.The world and all its interactional black holes would likely have Emily Post spewing her tea. The grande dame of all things manners died in 1960. but two of her descendants have overhauled her book of tips for the 21st century to mark the centennial of the first edition. I think mostly that it s really easy to paint etiquette and manners as tools for elitism. tools for secrecy. tools for exclusion.  said Lizzie Post. Emily s great-great-granddaughter and co-author of the latest  Emily Post s Etiquette.  And when they are used that way. and they definitely can be. they are effectively useless. But when we re using etiquette and manners as a tool for self-reflection and awareness of others. I think we re really going to have a chance to make the world a nicer place.  she said.As incivility has taken an even stronger hold on the culture. the newfangled book encourages patience and humility in talking over difficult subjects. That. it notes. requires  getting comfortable with the idea that your brilliant remark could go unsaid.  The book also pleads for grace in losing and a  good apology.  avoiding the word  if  to neutralize the effort. or  but  to dig your hole deeper.Emily published her first version of the book under a different title in 1922 after making a name for herself as a novelist and travelogue writer. It s been freshened through the decades. but the 20th edition out in October is a comprehensive update.There s plenty of advice on setting tables. dressing for different occasions. and basic courtesies on things like gifting. tipping and greetings. But Lizzie Post. and her cousin and co-author. Daniel Post Senning. have taken on issues far more crucial. They ve done it in part by crowdsourcing. including ideas from callers to their Awesome Etiquette podcast.And they did it in the middle of a pandemic and the #MeToo movement. both recognized in subjects like optional handshakes. or seeking permission to hug or kiss on the cheek. The hug is such an intimate gesture that. for some. an unwanted one can feel like a violation.  the new book notes in part.  When someone doesn t ask. pushes for one. or even forces it. they re communicating that because they think it s okay. they get to press their body against someone else s. Depending on how it s done. it can cross over into sexual harassment or assault. Not exactly groundbreaking. unless written under the name of Emily Post.Emily herself was born into East Coast privilege. growing up in Baltimore and New York City. Her father was a prominent architect for the rich. who designed the tony enclave of Tuxedo Park. New York. and her mother was the daughter of a coal baron.Emily met her husband. Edward. at a Fifth Avenue ball. There was scandal involving his romantic dalliances with chorus girls and actresses. resulting in a divorce announced in 1906. according to a biographer and reports at the time. Her inner circle attempted to secure her privacy after that. and her descendants have some wise words for friends and family offering sympathy today in divorces and separations. Avoid trying to push or suggest the right decision for a friend.  the Posts write in the new book.  It s especially important to be careful what you say around children whose parents are separated or divorcing. Cheering the news or making negative comments is unnecessary. The book takes on other losses often left unaddressed in Emily s time. such as grieving a miscarriage. You absolutely want to avoid saying things such as. `Next time it ll happen.‘  or `This just wasn t your time.   the book counsels.Through her travels. Emily learned more about the lives of those outside her social milieu. By 1922. she wrote in the first chapter of the book s first edition. what was then called  Best Society  wasn t a group born into great wealth or status but one comprised of  gentlefolk  who take care of each other. Best Society.  she wrote.  is not at all like a court with an especial queen or king. nor is it confined to any one place or group. but might be better described as an unlimited brotherhood which spreads over the entire surface of the globe. the members of which are invariably people of cultivation and worldly knowledge. who have not only perfect manners. but a perfect manner. Her descendants take on privilege this way:  Privilege can be and sound like many different things. but in conversation. it mostly comes across as a lack of awareness that you have benefited in a way others may not have. Modern-day manners on pronouns are also addressed in the new book. as a way to show  support. respect. and basic courtesy.  You might think someone s pronouns are easy enough to tell just by looking at them. but the reality is this isn t always the case.  the Posts write.  If you don t know someone s pronouns. and you need to know them in order to make an introduction. asking is the polite thing to do: `Joan. what pronouns do you use?′ Note that you don t ask what pronouns Joan `prefers  — an unfortunately common construction for this question. Emily was 87 when she died. Ironically. Lizzie Post said in an interview.  the older she got. the less she enjoyed participating in society. ... She felt. I think. a lot of autonomy and a lot of power and a lot of agency in just being able to stay home and not have it be a big deal. Expanding her empire all the while with other books of etiquette.As an only child. Emily was a  daddy s girl.  Lizzie said. and losing her father in 1903 was a blow. Other tragedies followed. Her mother was killed in a car accident in 1909. One of her two sons. Bruce. grew up to be an architect like her father but died at 32 of appendicitis as the two worked together on a house in Martha s Vineyard. That s where she summered as she continued to write new books and churn out editions of her etiquette bible.With her surviving son. Ned. she founded The Emily Post Institute in 1946. and the family still runs it today.In print. Emily grew  more inclusive over the years.  said Lizzie. Emily s etiquette became based more on education and merit than ideology and socioeconomic status. she said.For that. Lizzie said.  I m happy. ___http://twitter.com/litalie,Entertainment News

The glitz and glamour of entertainment is nothing without the people who dress today s biggest stars. For  Who s Behind the Clothes.  HuffPost spotlights stylists and costume designers who have delivered some of our favorite celebrities  or characters  most memorable looks. Read my interview with  Industry  costume designer Colleen Morris-Glennon.Tiffany Hasbourne has taken her fashion talents global. from her Caribbean household in the LeFrak City neighborhood in Queens. New York. to Colombia. Germany and beyond. But before she became the costume designer on Donald Glover s FX series  Atlanta.  she attended college in Georgia.The stylist and costume designer graduated from the Art Institute of Atlanta with a degree in computer animation. However. self-expression through clothing had been a common thread through her life. dating as far back as her private school days. When Hasbourne told her father she planned to switch lanes to fashion. he struggled to grasp the concept.  And oddly. he didn t really understand what I did until I did the TV show ‘Shooter.   said Hasbourne. recalling the first series she designed on her own.  Because of him being in the military. he was actually pretty impressed that I understood military uniforms. He was like. ‘So who do you dress on the show?  I laughed like. ‘Everybody. Dad!  From costume designing on  P-Valley  to the pilot for  All American: Homecoming  to  Ballers  and other shows. Hasbourne has made a name for herself in television and film. She got her start working with clients such as radio personality Angie Martinez. rapper Busta Rhymes and musical icon Missy Elliott. in recent years. she s added actor Brian Tyree Henry to her roster.  What I have learned working with Busta and Missy has made me a custom queen.  she said.  Because I feel like I get to offer someone whatever they want without limitation. Hasbourne believes that neither her clients nor her career should have limitations. refusing to be confined to a stylist-vs.-costume-designer binary. Rather. she believes in the power of  both. and.  Hasbourne talked to HuffPost about designing the final season of  Atlanta.  bridging European style with Southern flare. and what s next in her fashion career. What is your creative process for studying a character and envisioning their style? From Uncle Clifford in  P-Valley  to Paper Boi and Earn in  Atlanta.  they re each very different in how they present and in the messaging they re trying to send as well.One of the things I really had to think about in terms of doing Season 2 of  Atlanta.  I remember my show [that I was working on] had just shut down because an actor got hurt. I went on vacation. and I watched all of  Atlanta  Season 1. I was like.  OK. how do you make this different?  At that time. the show didn t have a lot of money for wardrobe yet. which was great. because that s when I use my resources as a stylist. I was able to bring in my relationship with Adidas. which then in turn. Donald [Glover] ended up getting an Adidas deal. One of the things that I pitched to him was what people don t realize is that even though artists may look like they have money. a lot of people are giving them things. We can make it where he s using promo. I actually used promo to start influencing the characters around Paper Boi and Paper Boi himself — because when you re an artist and people give you free stuff. you share. Donald actually related to that as an artist. because he was like.  That s super accurate. Because I do that with [my brother] Stephen.  I think that was one of the things that we were able to do in Season 2 in terms of seeing the Prps [jeans]. the Adidas. AKOO. which was an Atlanta-based brand. and doing what would make sense in the real world. When I consulted for Season 3. with the European designer. I just gave her some brands that I thought the actors would wear. Of course. she did her own thing with that. The stand-alone episodes for Season 3 that I did. they were individual stories. so I just tailored those to what the story was. The vision for Season 4 was every time I ve ever done a job in another country. how did that influence my particular personal style? What I made sure I did with Season 4 was make sure they re a little bit more elevated.We went from watching Earn. who dropped out of Princeton. struggle endlessly to seeing him fitted in designer. Right. It s one of those things where it s tough with  Atlanta  because the clothes are never Hiro [Murai] s and Donald s priority. It s about the story. It s about the visuals in terms of how it looks and what the storyline is. It has to be subtly done where it s not in their face because if it s too contrived. they re like.  No. no. we don t like it.  As someone who went to school in Atlanta. I would have to literally send Hiro a picture like.  Bro. look at this dude in the mall. They do the most!  It s that world where. creatively. you re trying to push the envelope. You re like.  I know you don t want it to be this. but this is Atlanta. They ll go broke trying to keep up!  I think it was about elevating it. When I went to shoot in Europe. watching European fashion helped elevate me. I used that in terms of how it influenced Van. and the lesson of how what Paper Boi went through made Earn want to elevate as a manager and be taken seriously. One of the fun characters to always put wild stuff on. which is actually pretty easy because they actually push you to go left. is LaKeith [Stanfield] s character. Because Darius has always kind of gone left. I feel like. as odd as it is. there s a lot of pressure in making his character stand out. but also making it where it s cool enough that people also can relate to it. Tell me about how you dealt with that transition. from emulating European style to conveying where they are now geographically and professionally. What can we expect from the rest of Season 4. and how would you describe the characters  style evolutions this season? The beautiful thing about  Atlanta  is that each season has nothing to do with the other. There was something interesting about it. because I had a conversation with the costume designer that was going to do the European portion of it. They went to Europe. they shot it. and I had no clue what they landed on or what they ended up doing. They came back. we did all of Season 4. then we shot all of the stand-alone episodes for Season 3. I was able to ask.  Can I see a few pictures of what you did in Europe?  But to me. it didn t matter because I think each episode is so different. As long as I had the question in my head: How were you influenced when you lived abroad. and how can we use that to play into these characters? That was always the inspiration for me in terms of where I went with the characters. I had waited for years for the show to come back. It was such a hard dynamic for me. because I had shot half of the movie  Hustle  with Adam Sandler. I was supposed to go back and finish the second half. but it was clashing with the timing of Season 4. I was like.  I gotta go back and finish what I started with ‘Atlanta.   I have a storyboard that I pretty much presented to Hiro and Donald for every episode before we did it and shopped it. I knew exactly what I wanted for each episode. Once I read it. I knew exactly what I wanted those characters to look like. I could tell my shoppers verbatim.  I m looking for this. This is what I want. I want this. Here s a visual of it.  even down to what I wanted the looters to look like.You came from a background where you styled athletes. How have those skills carried over into your work in costume design on television?One of the reasons I think Lev [Stephen Levinson] hired me for  Ballers  is because he didn t even realize dressing athletes  bodies would be a challenge. When I was dressing LeSean  Shady  McCoy. although  Shady  wasn t the biggest. he had big thighs because he was a running back. It was like what jeans are good for a running back? Ones that have stretch. that give in the thighs. so AG jeans. With each project. I ve learned to do what s best for the actor. Working on  Atlanta.  I now have become Brian Tyree Henry s stylist. One of the things that I love about him is on his press tour for  Bullet Train.  GQ named him one of the best dressed on the press tour. One of the challenges for him is that he isn t necessarily sample size. You can buy him off the rack. but he isn t sample size. Then on top of that. he s really busy. He doesn t have time. all the time to do fittings. pull a bunch of stuff. for us to have an hour fitting. then let a tailor have two hours to do alterations. One of the things that I love is we do a lot of custom pieces for him. The thing that I love about that is I still get to make him feel good in his body. One of things I loved about  In Treatment  with Uzo [Aduba] — because Uzo s not plus size. she s curvy — we were able to do monochromatic hot pink. I m sure you understand being tall. you sometimes have to buy a bigger size just to get the length of something correctly. then you have to take the pants in or do something else. Then. they want to offer it in black or gray or blue. but what if you want yellow? What I have learned working with Busta [Rhymes] and Missy [Elliott] has made me a custom queen. Because I feel like I get to offer someone whatever they want without limitation. If [ P-Valley  creator] Katori [Hall] says.  I want something green.  I don t just go back to her and say.  They don t have any green suits in the store.  No. I go make it. It opens your palette in terms of what you can do if you re willing to go custom. From athletes to curvy women to men that are taller and/or broader. it s all about tailoring something to a person. With Uncle Clifford. do you know how hard it is to find women s clothing for a man that s over 6 feet tall? When I came in [on  P-Valley ] all the tailors there were stressed. and what I was able to do was take my styling resources and go to 5001 in New York and have them make Lil  Murda s fur cape. go to Alba designs in LA and order Uncle Clifford s suit for the grand reopening of the Pynk. You re able to go to these different resources and bring them all together.What was it like costume designing on  P-Valley ?When you come in midseason on a show like  P-Valley.  as a designer. I try to be very respectful of what the designer before me started in terms of what their vision is. One of the things that I loved about Katori in our conversation was she was open to what my version of those characters were. For me. jumping in. it was like.  OK. well. what did I miss? Where s Lil  Murda now? Had he been on tour? He has been on tour. So he s made a little money — and what does that look like? If he s standing next to Tina Snow and he s performing. what does that look like?  One of the beautiful things about Uncle Clifford is Nicco [Annan] is so hands-on. he already has a vision. With him. creating Uncle Clifford looks are like playing tennis. He ll be like.  I like this.  and then it s my job to take whatever that version is and elevate it or bring it to life. I remember in Season 2. when they re standing in the poppy fields. and he s holding the umbrella. There s a scene where he s in those fields. again. talking to Corbin. and we played off the influence of  The Color Purple.  when Celie s sister and her kids came and there was that flowing fabric. We were inspired by a designer who had all these different fabrics and got a custom-made outfit. where he s standing near his Cadillac and there are the blowing pieces in the wind. Tell me about your journey into styling and costume design. Who ignited the spark for you?My mother. I went to private school until I got to high school. and I had to beg to go to public high school. In order for my father to allow me to go. I had to get accepted to a specialized high school. which was then the High School of Fashion Industries. Going to a private school. even though you wear a uniform. what most people didn t realize was you re trying to separate your individuality from everybody else who wears the same thing as you. One of the things that I used to enjoy was shopping with my mother. I remember going shopping with my mother on South Street in Philly and [visiting] this little antique shop or vintage shop. and she bought me this fork and spoon earring. People were like.  Why the fork and spoon?  and I was like.  I don t know. I just think it s cool! Especially when you go to a religious school where you re the minority — I went to St. John s in Queens in College Point. Then. I went to Kew Forest. which was in Kew Gardens. where a lot of my classmates were from very affluent neighborhoods where they had a lot of money. We did really well for ourselves. but my father lived very modestly. so that I could go to private school. It was one of those things where you wear a uniform. but you find the right shoe. you find the right jewelry. you find the right accessories. I think that s played a big part in me being a stylist. learning how to take something and make the most out of it. People assume that being around people who have money. they buy all this designer stuff — and it s actually really the opposite. They buy pieces. It really taught me how to take staple items. expand on them. and make it work. What draws you into particular projects? What makes you want to sign on and say yes?Each project has been different for me. For  Ballers.  it was the challenge of me doing what I was already doing in real life and putting it on screen. I had watched things that I thought were supposed to represent us but watching them. I was like.  This isn t right. Like. we wouldn t do that.  which is one of the things that I will forever be grateful to Stephen Levinson about. That was one of the producers that I could literally go to. sit and say.  We wouldn t do this.  and he would go  OK. what would you do?  and he would actually listen. For  Ballers.  it was the urge of wanting to get it right. I think it was the same with  All American: Homecoming.  and actually liking the show that came prior to that. For  Shooter.  it was the fact that I didn t have the experience to do it. I remember my first interview. I was probably on the phone with 10 executives and basically they said. flat out.  Why should we give you this job?  and I was like.  I don t have an ego. All I can do is put my performance before my pride and get this right.  It was really hard. but to this day. Omar Epps is like a brother to me. I feel like we walked away with this family. doing something that was really hard and challenging. that had serious content. but we all committed to it and took it very seriously. The first few projects of my career. although they were shows that had people of color in them. they weren t really considered cultural staples or touch points. When  Atlanta  was presented to me. for the first time. I was like.  Oh. well. here s my opportunity to do that.  For me. the draw was going back to Atlanta. right. I went to school in Atlanta. I know the city of Atlanta. I feel like as a girl from New York. that was where I first gained my independence. I first started dressing artists there. stepping out on my own and doing fashion. working with groups like Jagged Edge. That was me going back to my roots. Now. I think I pick projects based on what s going to move the needle.Is there a particular character you ve styled on a show that has been your favorite or the most challenging?I don t have any favorites. because they re all so different. Now. I have favorite looks that I ve created where I ve been like.  Oh. this one is a favorite for me.  but I don t have favorite characters. because I think each of them have been so special and unique to me. Dr. Brooke on  In Treatment  was a special one for me because this is the first time that we see a therapist that is coming from a neighborhood in LA where Black women have money. It was very important. especially with someone who wasn t a size 2. to make sure that we weren t lazy in showing what that looked like and pushing the envelope in terms of what that style looked like. I remember on that show they were trying to keep things real conservative. That was a 22-episode series. and Uzo Aduba was in every episode. I had to build a mannequin of her body just to try outfits on the mannequin. because she wasn t always available for fitting. I had like four amazing monochromatic looks. The producers just kept bumping us on it. like  No. no. no.  Then Inauguration Day happened and Michelle Obama. Jennifer Lopez. and everyone walked out in these beautiful monochromatic looks. We were like.  You see! This is it. This is what people are doing. What are you working on currently?The name of this movie is  Shadow Force.  It s Kerry Washington and Omar Sy. Think  Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  When you work with these actors that have these iconic characters. for Kerry. wearing certain coats. she s like.  It s too Olivia Pope.  This is her doing a full. live-action movie where she s fighting. so how do I get the audience to see Kyra and not Olivia Pope. right? Yes. she s done all these other things since Olivia Pope. but that s still something for her that she plays. Even for Omar. he has  Lupin.  For me. in all my projects. a piece of me that I sprinkle in there is somebody s gonna have some type of fire footwear. I m a sneakerhead. The pressure for me with Omar was with him doing  Lupin.  he was like.  My character always wears Jordan 1s.  I m like.  Yeah. but they re not the exclusive exclusive joints.  So he s like.  OK. well. what are you thinking?  You re gonna see something that s like. woo.Where do you see your career going next?Honestly. I love fashion so much in terms of being a costume designer. but I would also love to creatively produce. I feel like I have so much to offer in terms of resources. with productions who may not have bigger budgets. being able to help build relationships with clothing lines. I see directors now that are asking designers to help with their movies. As another costume designer. I m always like.  Oh. my God. like. they should call such and such.  but it s like you don t ever want to overstep. You have to let each designer do their own process. You see TV shows where the producers are like.  Hey. we re looking for upcoming designers.  I would love to be a creative producer in terms of that. People have always asked me if I would ever want to do a line. I wouldn t want to do a line but I would definitely want to do some sort of collaboration. A lot of my friends are like.  You need to change your name on Instagram from @TiffTheStylist to @TiffTheDesigner.  I always feel torn about it because I just had this conversation with D-Nice. who is the person who gave me the name @TiffTheStylist. I like there would be no designer without the stylist. I m not an  or  girl. I m not a stylist or designer. I m a stylist and a designer. I like to live in both worlds.,Entertainment News

Paul Bettany is set to reprise his role as Vision. the synthezoid created from vibranium. The series is expected to center around Vision  trying to regain his memory and humanity.  per the outlet.

The two Visions ultimately squared off in a battle royal in the final ninth episode of the show.The episode has led some to unofficially refer to the upcoming show as  the White Vision project  based on the most recent on-screen version of the character. Olsen could also potentially return as Wanda Maximoff in the upcoming spinoff. according to the outlet. Nonetheless.

The glitz and glamour of entertainment is nothing without the people who dress today s biggest stars. For  Who s Behind the Clothes.  HuffPost spotlights stylists and costume designers who have delivered some of our favorite celebrities or characters  most memorable looks. Assistant stylist to some of today s most prominent rappers. such as Future. Gunna. Roddy Ricch and more. Jenna Tyson is a powerhouse. Upon graduating from the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy. her plan was to take the editorial route and be at the helm of magazine covers. However. fashion legend Hylton saw a vision for Tyson that she didn t know was possible. Tyson said.  Hindsight being 20/20. at the time. I was just like. ‘Why hip-hop? Why rappers? Why do I need to do these things when you know where my passion lies?  But in the past five years. I ve been so appreciative and had those conversations with her like. thank God. she saw what I didn t see.  standout looks unmatched creativityTia Adeolaa custom. gold-encrusted leotardPaper magazine cover Before Tyson became a stylist to the rap stars. she was a bright-eyed graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology s millinery program. Hailing from California. she moved to New York City during Rihanna s  Rated R  era. In an effort to find the  So Hard  singer s stylist. Tyson began researching fervently. landing upon Mariel Haenn. Tyson learned that Haenn acquired Rihanna as a client through none other than Misa Hylton. an award-winning fashion industry pioneer who has styled Lil  Kim. Mary J. Blige and countless other Black icons.  When I started researching Misa. I was just mind-blown from all the things that she had done. like her creative direction on the ‘Crush on You  video.  Tyson said. referencing Lil  Kim s iconic 1997 music video.  I was like. ‘Mariel is great. but Misa Hylton s who I want.   In summer 2012. Tyson enrolled in Hylton s critically acclaimed eponymous fashion academy — and there. Tyson s life changed.With the release of Flo Milli s sophomore album  You Still Here. Ho?  and the hilarious skits that accompanied its rollout. the 22-year-old musician from Alabama became a style starlet. Ahead of Flo Milli s debut tour launching Oct. 17. Tyson talked to HuffPost about her stylist journey. barriers that Black stylists have to overcome and what it s like working with Flo Milli. You ve styled or assisted so many of Flo s iconic looks. from her Paper magazine cover to her  Flosephine Baker  shoot. It s no secret that Flo Milli is a creative visionary and conceptual queen. especially with her latest album rollout. How do you bring her visions to life with clothes and converge them in a way that makes sense for the artist. while continuing to push the needle?[By] taking my time. I ve worked with Misa for so long. so when it was time for that Paper magazine cover. it came together in so many different ways — but conceptually. paying attention for years to her creative process. When it was something that Misa allowed us all to come together and figure out the concepts for. it was me. her daughter Madison. and Misa that came together with those concepts. She has a very particular creative process. We were working with Diesel. and they were sponsoring that Paper magazine shoot. Another good friend of mine. Nikki Martinez. is a consultant at Diesel and we came up with the upcycled piece of it. We needed so much denim. and they only had a roll. so Nikki was like.  We have all this old-season denim you can take.  That was just using your relationships. working with people. and not having an ego … It s so stressful. It s so crazy. then it comes together and you re like.  Whew. OK. this was great.  especially being able to do all the aspects that we did. coming back to being a Black woman. Flo has an amazing manager. who s also a creative: Ebonie Ward. She is very integral in coming up with a lot of the creatives for Flo. She also is kind of like a silent killer. she watches. she plots. she puts things together. She was a huge part of Flo s rollout. It s a lot of work. but it s passion-fueled because I m fortunate enough to work with young. Black female creatives. It s rare. and we re continuing to push the envelope. we re continuing to create opportunities in hopes that there are people that come behind us that want to do similar things. It s an incredible opportunity to be able to work with someone like Ebonie. because we re not just hypersexualizing everything that Flo is doing. Everything is so methodical. everything makes sense. and everything has passion behind it. That. in and of itself. is inspiring. because no matter the roadblocks or the hardships. you know that it has heart. it has soul. Sometimes Twitter responding gives you everything that you need. It s better than getting writeups in fashion magazines. It s like.  Well. we re touching the people.  That s the pulse. that s the beat of the world. How would you describe Flo s style? You brought up an excellent point about how you re leaning into the rap princess aesthetic. while also not trying to hypersexualize her. How do you make sure that you re hitting the mark with each client. from Future to Gunna? With Future and Gunna. I really just follow Bobby [Williams ] lead. He s an incredible. one-of-a-kind stylist. It s always nice to have that female and male perspective. so on Bobby s projects. if needed. I just bring my female perspective for those things. and learn as much as I can from him because he s worked with so many different people. With Flo. she has great style. she has an evolving style. I think the best thing about her is that she loves so many different things. like a true creative does. We re able to really have range and do a lot of different things as you can see from  Roaring 20s  to  Conceited.  She s willing to tap into different aesthetics. the same way she has different sounds. she ll play with different fashion. which I think is great. Her being so young. she has so much time to tap into every type of style that there is. We like to take our time with her. aesthetically. so that she has somewhere to go. If she just jumps into one aesthetic or something super sexy now. then where is she going to grow to? I think it s important to let her be her age. work with that. and let it be organic. She s a 22-year-old girl. so it s letting her be 22. Tell me about your journey to styling. What was your inspiration or impetus for entering the industry?I ve been in the business for 10 years. This is actually my 10-year anniversary of attending the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy. so that s one of my first and most beloved mentors. I was one of the first students to ever attend her school in New York. I grew up in Orange County. California. I went to a performing arts high school. and I moved to New York when I was 21 to start chasing my dreams of being in fashion. My biggest inspiration at that time was  Sex and the City  and Patricia Field. It doesn t get any better than that. just the range that she had on that show. I read an article at the time that said that her biggest inspiration was New York City as a backdrop. so I stopped everything in California and came to the big city.Did you find that there was a gap in how West Coast style translates on the East Coast?Being from Orange County or just Southern California. it s very lax. chill. kind of like surfer vibes. I was more into vintage at that time. so I liked high fashion designers like Givenchy and Balenciaga. but also the classic silhouettes and girly. feminine aesthetics and proper dressing. It s night and day. I think that the real style. the authenticity that they have on the East Coast. specifically in New York. was something that was most inspiring to me. especially because it s so culturally diverse. I had never experienced that in this way. meeting Afro Latinos and Afro Caribbeans and seeing that kind of melting pot. What I love the most about New York is that it s about the authenticity of your character and your style. So if you re cool. you re cool. If you can dress. you can dress. It wasn t about like. all the extra fluff.How would you characterize or describe your personal style now. and how has it shifted over the years?It s shifted pretty drastically. I tried to incorporate some of the older vintage that I have. but I m a streetwear fanatic now: Japanese designs. some American fashion — everyone loves Rick [Owens]. But I love streetwear. I love oversized. I love Margiela. Simone Rocha. I like wearable art if it s comfortable. Then. I like Black designers like Denim Tears. Marni for cozy vibes. I like streetwear because I think that we live in a time that s hypersexualized. so I like to play on comfort and cool aesthetics. but I m also a little bit older now. I ve had my time wanting to be sexy and wearing dresses. but now I just like to be a little more serious and focused. I will switch it up and dress up if that s what it calls for. Who instilled your love for clothing and fashion? My grandfather had always influenced me. He has really immaculate style. He s very particular about his aesthetic. his clothes. He s very clean. he loves everything about grooming. skin care and fragrance. I took a lot of that from him and that was like a big part of my childhood. When it was my birthday. he would always take me shopping. That instilled a lot of my pride about my style. and taking care of my material possessions. Could you tell me a little bit about your relationship to Misa. and how that s developed over the years? As I got to know Misa and grew my relationship with her. she really just helped shape my career. seeing the things that I was good at. and seeing the things that I lacked. At the time. I was just like.  Why hip-hop? Why rappers? Why do I need to do these things when you know where my passion lies?  But in the past five years. I ve been so appreciative of those conversations with her. Thank God she saw what I didn t see. She pushed me in this direction because it s really changed the trajectory of my career and my life. especially now being in a full circle moment. working with my first independent client that s a female rapper. It s great to be a part of Flo Milli s legacy. then play on all the different lines of being girly and feminine and having those essential rapper attributes.When you started your career. what were some of the hardest obstacles? The most constant issue as a Black stylist with Black clients is sourcing. Until you re at the height of your career. people don t want to lend and support. We do get a lot of support from certain brands and I very much appreciate that. but there are other brands that we don t get that support from. We have to just buy it. and if we don t buy it. we won t have it. Although we push the culture forward and we are the influence. they still don t give us the same support and respect that they should. Because of that. since the pandemic. I ve been fortunate enough with Flo to work specifically with brands that do support her and with Black-owned brands. We re able to stay in that space. and it s intentional. because they ve supported us. so we want to continue to support them as everyone in the scenario grows. As an aspiring stylist and an assistant. the thing that people maybe don t pay attention to enough is how much time assisting takes. It takes going through some things. it takes really committing to being an assistant. To learn how to be a leader. you have to follow. It s learning from people — good. bad or ugly — what you need to navigate in the industry: the skill set that you need. the work and determination that you need. the capital that you need. I think it looks so glamorous and it seems like such an incredible job. It s not just artistic. it s not just creative. at the base of it. it s a business. So. it s having the patience to wait until it is your time and up until that time being able to pour into somebody else s career as an asset and help them while learning. Vera Wang said it took her so long to start her company because she was assisting and she was being paid to learn. I look at the last 10 years of my career in a similar way. I was being paid to learn under some very incredible people. but I think it s the humility that you probably don t see.Who are some clientele you would like to add to your roster? Where do you see yourself going next?I would like to get more into the athlete space. and have both male and female clients. I d love to have the gauge of being able to broaden my range. I love artists. but I think having too many artists can be a little tricky. I would like to do more creative direction. working with brands. and doing more design.I was just the assistant costume designer for  Power Book II: Ghost.  the second season. That was an incredible opportunity and experience. I did that with Eric Archibald. so that was a cool eight months. I wouldn t mind doing something else that is costume design — and that s something else I love about Flo because she s so multifaceted. She s going into the acting space with her visuals. and it s so great that we re able to dabble in costume design. too. Will you be joining Flo Milli on tour?I ll be there for the first 10 days.What does tour prep look like for you as a stylist?It s intense. I ve been on a lot of tours. though. so I m fortunate enough to already have a base of it. You re making sure that there s a look for every city. then a fine line of giving her a range of options for when she wants to have options. But we re still sticking to a costume and a silhouette so that her audience gets the same show every night. I think aesthetically it s importantly to give the same costumes as well so that it feels the same and no one feels like they got a different experience.You ve talked about how you ve wanted to maintain uniformity in the show. but is sourcing difficult because of the fact that it is a tour? Do you need multiples of a garment or are you constantly washing the same pieces?Sometimes you do want to have something different for each date. but it s not realistic. It doesn t matter where you are in your career. What you re supposed to do on tour as an artist is have a costume. so you should have costumes that interchange color palettes but then they get cleaned on your off days. Especially for Flo being her first tour. her breakout tour. so we re just getting warmed up and just getting started. Once she gets to that larger space. we ll really have all the surprises and the glitz and the glamour. But I think for this one. since she was a COVID artist. it s important that she is able to connect with her fans and be comfortable and give a good show. She is Gen Z. she s a real rapper and she likes to get in the audience.Can you describe what we ll expect from Flo Milli s style on tour?I wanna say her tagline [i.e.. Flo Milli Shit!]. but you re gonna see talent. you re gonna see artistry and you re going to see vibrations. I think it s important that it s relatable. I personally get tired of seeing everything be so costumey and everything mirroring each other. I don t like the fact that everyone looks the same. like all the female acts and artists seem to have one silhouette. all crystals. What you re gonna see with Flo Milli is what I hope you ve already seen. which is consistent with the Flo Milli aesthetic. You re definitely gonna see the Flo Milli flip and you re gonna see the elevation of her style. but it s still gonna feel like Flo. It s not gonna feel like a Broadway show. You re coming to see her rap and that s what you re gonna get.,Entertainment News

The glitz and glamour of entertainment is nothing without the people who dress today s biggest stars. For  Who s Behind the Clothes.  HuffPost spotlights stylists and costume designers who have delivered some of our favorite celebrities or characters  most memorable looks. Assistant stylist to some of today s most prominent rappers. such as Future. Gunna. Roddy Ricch and more. Jenna Tyson is a powerhouse. Upon graduating from the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy. her plan was to take the editorial route and be at the helm of magazine covers. However. fashion legend Hylton saw a vision for Tyson that she didn t know was possible. Tyson said.  Hindsight being 20/20. at the time. I was just like. ‘Why hip-hop? Why rappers? Why do I need to do these things when you know where my passion lies?  But in the past five years. I ve been so appreciative and had those conversations with her like. thank God. she saw what I didn t see.  standout looks unmatched creativityTia Adeolaa custom. gold-encrusted leotardPaper magazine cover Before Tyson became a stylist to the rap stars. she was a bright-eyed graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology s millinery program. Hailing from California. she moved to New York City during Rihanna s  Rated R  era. In an effort to find the  So Hard  singer s stylist. Tyson began researching fervently. landing upon Mariel Haenn. Tyson learned that Haenn acquired Rihanna as a client through none other than Misa Hylton. an award-winning fashion industry pioneer who has styled Lil  Kim. Mary J. Blige and countless other Black icons.  When I started researching Misa. I was just mind-blown from all the things that she had done. like her creative direction on the ‘Crush on You  video.  Tyson said. referencing Lil  Kim s iconic 1997 music video.  I was like. ‘Mariel is great. but Misa Hylton s who I want.   In summer 2012. Tyson enrolled in Hylton s critically acclaimed eponymous fashion academy — and there. Tyson s life changed.With the release of Flo Milli s sophomore album  You Still Here. Ho?  and the hilarious skits that accompanied its rollout. the 22-year-old musician from Alabama became a style starlet. Ahead of Flo Milli s debut tour launching Oct. 17. Tyson talked to HuffPost about her stylist journey. barriers that Black stylists have to overcome and what it s like working with Flo Milli. You ve styled or assisted so many of Flo s iconic looks. from her Paper magazine cover to her  Flosephine Baker  shoot. It s no secret that Flo Milli is a creative visionary and conceptual queen. especially with her latest album rollout. How do you bring her visions to life with clothes and converge them in a way that makes sense for the artist. while continuing to push the needle?[By] taking my time. I ve worked with Misa for so long. so when it was time for that Paper magazine cover. it came together in so many different ways — but conceptually. paying attention for years to her creative process. When it was something that Misa allowed us all to come together and figure out the concepts for. it was me. her daughter Madison. and Misa that came together with those concepts. She has a very particular creative process. We were working with Diesel. and they were sponsoring that Paper magazine shoot. Another good friend of mine. Nikki Martinez. is a consultant at Diesel and we came up with the upcycled piece of it. We needed so much denim. and they only had a roll. so Nikki was like.  We have all this old-season denim you can take.  That was just using your relationships. working with people. and not having an ego … It s so stressful. It s so crazy. then it comes together and you re like.  Whew. OK. this was great.  especially being able to do all the aspects that we did. coming back to being a Black woman. Flo has an amazing manager. who s also a creative: Ebonie Ward. She is very integral in coming up with a lot of the creatives for Flo. She also is kind of like a silent killer. she watches. she plots. she puts things together. She was a huge part of Flo s rollout. It s a lot of work. but it s passion-fueled because I m fortunate enough to work with young. Black female creatives. It s rare. and we re continuing to push the envelope. we re continuing to create opportunities in hopes that there are people that come behind us that want to do similar things. It s an incredible opportunity to be able to work with someone like Ebonie. because we re not just hypersexualizing everything that Flo is doing. Everything is so methodical. everything makes sense. and everything has passion behind it. That. in and of itself. is inspiring. because no matter the roadblocks or the hardships. you know that it has heart. it has soul. Sometimes Twitter responding gives you everything that you need. It s better than getting writeups in fashion magazines. It s like.  Well. we re touching the people.  That s the pulse. that s the beat of the world. How would you describe Flo s style? You brought up an excellent point about how you re leaning into the rap princess aesthetic. while also not trying to hypersexualize her. How do you make sure that you re hitting the mark with each client. from Future to Gunna? With Future and Gunna. I really just follow Bobby [Williams ] lead. He s an incredible. one-of-a-kind stylist. It s always nice to have that female and male perspective. so on Bobby s projects. if needed. I just bring my female perspective for those things. and learn as much as I can from him because he s worked with so many different people. With Flo. she has great style. she has an evolving style. I think the best thing about her is that she loves so many different things. like a true creative does. We re able to really have range and do a lot of different things as you can see from  Roaring 20s  to  Conceited.  She s willing to tap into different aesthetics. the same way she has different sounds. she ll play with different fashion. which I think is great. Her being so young. she has so much time to tap into every type of style that there is. We like to take our time with her. aesthetically. so that she has somewhere to go. If she just jumps into one aesthetic or something super sexy now. then where is she going to grow to? I think it s important to let her be her age. work with that. and let it be organic. She s a 22-year-old girl. so it s letting her be 22. Tell me about your journey to styling. What was your inspiration or impetus for entering the industry?I ve been in the business for 10 years. This is actually my 10-year anniversary of attending the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy. so that s one of my first and most beloved mentors. I was one of the first students to ever attend her school in New York. I grew up in Orange County. California. I went to a performing arts high school. and I moved to New York when I was 21 to start chasing my dreams of being in fashion. My biggest inspiration at that time was  Sex and the City  and Patricia Field. It doesn t get any better than that. just the range that she had on that show. I read an article at the time that said that her biggest inspiration was New York City as a backdrop. so I stopped everything in California and came to the big city.Did you find that there was a gap in how West Coast style translates on the East Coast?Being from Orange County or just Southern California. it s very lax. chill. kind of like surfer vibes. I was more into vintage at that time. so I liked high fashion designers like Givenchy and Balenciaga. but also the classic silhouettes and girly. feminine aesthetics and proper dressing. It s night and day. I think that the real style. the authenticity that they have on the East Coast. specifically in New York. was something that was most inspiring to me. especially because it s so culturally diverse. I had never experienced that in this way. meeting Afro Latinos and Afro Caribbeans and seeing that kind of melting pot. What I love the most about New York is that it s about the authenticity of your character and your style. So if you re cool. you re cool. If you can dress. you can dress. It wasn t about like. all the extra fluff.How would you characterize or describe your personal style now. and how has it shifted over the years?It s shifted pretty drastically. I tried to incorporate some of the older vintage that I have. but I m a streetwear fanatic now: Japanese designs. some American fashion — everyone loves Rick [Owens]. But I love streetwear. I love oversized. I love Margiela. Simone Rocha. I like wearable art if it s comfortable. Then. I like Black designers like Denim Tears. Marni for cozy vibes. I like streetwear because I think that we live in a time that s hypersexualized. so I like to play on comfort and cool aesthetics. but I m also a little bit older now. I ve had my time wanting to be sexy and wearing dresses. but now I just like to be a little more serious and focused. I will switch it up and dress up if that s what it calls for. Who instilled your love for clothing and fashion? My grandfather had always influenced me. He has really immaculate style. He s very particular about his aesthetic. his clothes. He s very clean. he loves everything about grooming. skin care and fragrance. I took a lot of that from him and that was like a big part of my childhood. When it was my birthday. he would always take me shopping. That instilled a lot of my pride about my style. and taking care of my material possessions. Could you tell me a little bit about your relationship to Misa. and how that s developed over the years? As I got to know Misa and grew my relationship with her. she really just helped shape my career. seeing the things that I was good at. and seeing the things that I lacked. At the time. I was just like.  Why hip-hop? Why rappers? Why do I need to do these things when you know where my passion lies?  But in the past five years. I ve been so appreciative of those conversations with her. Thank God she saw what I didn t see. She pushed me in this direction because it s really changed the trajectory of my career and my life. especially now being in a full circle moment. working with my first independent client that s a female rapper. It s great to be a part of Flo Milli s legacy. then play on all the different lines of being girly and feminine and having those essential rapper attributes.When you started your career. what were some of the hardest obstacles? The most constant issue as a Black stylist with Black clients is sourcing. Until you re at the height of your career. people don t want to lend and support. We do get a lot of support from certain brands and I very much appreciate that. but there are other brands that we don t get that support from. We have to just buy it. and if we don t buy it. we won t have it. Although we push the culture forward and we are the influence. they still don t give us the same support and respect that they should. Because of that. since the pandemic. I ve been fortunate enough with Flo to work specifically with brands that do support her and with Black-owned brands. We re able to stay in that space. and it s intentional. because they ve supported us. so we want to continue to support them as everyone in the scenario grows. As an aspiring stylist and an assistant. the thing that people maybe don t pay attention to enough is how much time assisting takes. It takes going through some things. it takes really committing to being an assistant. To learn how to be a leader. you have to follow. It s learning from people — good. bad or ugly — what you need to navigate in the industry: the skill set that you need. the work and determination that you need. the capital that you need. I think it looks so glamorous and it seems like such an incredible job. It s not just artistic. it s not just creative. at the base of it. it s a business. So. it s having the patience to wait until it is your time and up until that time being able to pour into somebody else s career as an asset and help them while learning. Vera Wang said it took her so long to start her company because she was assisting and she was being paid to learn. I look at the last 10 years of my career in a similar way. I was being paid to learn under some very incredible people. but I think it s the humility that you probably don t see.Who are some clientele you would like to add to your roster? Where do you see yourself going next?I would like to get more into the athlete space. and have both male and female clients. I d love to have the gauge of being able to broaden my range. I love artists. but I think having too many artists can be a little tricky. I would like to do more creative direction. working with brands. and doing more design.I was just the assistant costume designer for  Power Book II: Ghost.  the second season. That was an incredible opportunity and experience. I did that with Eric Archibald. so that was a cool eight months. I wouldn t mind doing something else that is costume design — and that s something else I love about Flo because she s so multifaceted. She s going into the acting space with her visuals. and it s so great that we re able to dabble in costume design. too. Will you be joining Flo Milli on tour?I ll be there for the first 10 days.What does tour prep look like for you as a stylist?It s intense. I ve been on a lot of tours. though. so I m fortunate enough to already have a base of it. You re making sure that there s a look for every city. then a fine line of giving her a range of options for when she wants to have options. But we re still sticking to a costume and a silhouette so that her audience gets the same show every night. I think aesthetically it s importantly to give the same costumes as well so that it feels the same and no one feels like they got a different experience.You ve talked about how you ve wanted to maintain uniformity in the show. but is sourcing difficult because of the fact that it is a tour? Do you need multiples of a garment or are you constantly washing the same pieces?Sometimes you do want to have something different for each date. but it s not realistic. It doesn t matter where you are in your career. What you re supposed to do on tour as an artist is have a costume. so you should have costumes that interchange color palettes but then they get cleaned on your off days. Especially for Flo being her first tour. her breakout tour. so we re just getting warmed up and just getting started. Once she gets to that larger space. we ll really have all the surprises and the glitz and the glamour. But I think for this one. since she was a COVID artist. it s important that she is able to connect with her fans and be comfortable and give a good show. She is Gen Z. she s a real rapper and she likes to get in the audience.Can you describe what we ll expect from Flo Milli s style on tour?I wanna say her tagline [i.e.. Flo Milli Shit!]. but you re gonna see talent. you re gonna see artistry and you re going to see vibrations. I think it s important that it s relatable. I personally get tired of seeing everything be so costumey and everything mirroring each other. I don t like the fact that everyone looks the same. like all the female acts and artists seem to have one silhouette. all crystals. What you re gonna see with Flo Milli is what I hope you ve already seen. which is consistent with the Flo Milli aesthetic. You re definitely gonna see the Flo Milli flip and you re gonna see the elevation of her style. but it s still gonna feel like Flo. It s not gonna feel like a Broadway show. You re coming to see her rap and that s what you re gonna get.,Entertainment News

I always ask them: ‘What s necessary about the story?  And when I asked myself that question. it kept coming back to these lessons I learned from my mother.  he told HuffPost in an interview.

Back in September. Taylor Swift offered a glimpse into her songwriting process while speaking at the Nashville Songwriter Awards. She sorts her songs into three categories. she said —  quill lyrics. fountain pen lyrics and glitter gel pen lyrics  — based on the writing implement she imagined using when composing each one.Quill lyrics. she explained. were words that could have come out of a Charlotte Brontë novel. The fountain pen was reserved for  a modern storyline or references. with a poetic twist. … The songs I categorize in this style sound like confessions scribbled and sealed in an envelope. but too brutally honest to ever send.  And. finally. the glitter gel pen was for the  frivolous. carefree. bouncy  songs. I don t actually have a quill — anymore. I broke it once when I was mad.  she added.It was a timely reveal. perhaps the subtlest of Easter eggs that Swift is so fond of leaving fans in the lead-up to album releases. Her latest work.  Midnights.  feels like a perfect combination of those fountain and glitter gel pens. plumbing obsessive thoughts and emotional depths over a layer of boppy drum machine beats and slick production.The album. which Swift teased in August as  13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.  is one of her most cohesive. full of the restless wonderings that keep you from sleep as well as the adrenaline that makes it impossible to call it a night.It s a big departure from the early pandemic surprise drops of  Folklore  and  Evermore  that embodied coziness and escape. Gone are the cardigans and duster coats. this era is metallic eye shadow. too-high heels and feather boas. On  Midnights.  Swift offers a poppy. self-aware return to old haunts — meditations on fame. comeuppance. self-doubt. losing past relationships and protecting her current one. Imagine if you threw  1989.   Reputation  and  Lover  in a blender and sent it to therapy.The album opens with  Lavender Haze.  a breathy. thumping ode to staying in the titular fog of new love. ignoring naysayers and onlookers ready to pick it apart.  All they keep asking me / Is if I m gonna be your bride.  Swift sings.  The only kinda girl they see / Is a one-night or a wife.  I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser.  Swift confesses later on the immediate standout  Anti-Hero.   Midnights become my afternoons.  There are the occasional lyrical quirks in this cheeky self-reflection that will become divisive among listeners — lines like  Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I m a monster on the hill  can only be loved or hated. (For the record. I m in the former camp.)  You re on Your Own. Kid.  the fifth track on the album. reads like a look back on Swift s beginnings. Crushes and teenage concerns give way to her music career. and she learns that all that glitters is not gold.  I search the party of better bodies / Just to learn that my dreams aren t rare.  she sings at one point. evoking a small fish in a big pond. ambitions that once felt grand brought to earth.Swift swore years ago that there s nothing she does better than revenge. and  Vigilante Shit  carries on that legacy. Its biting. sparse lyrics ( They say looks can kill. and I might try ) tell the tale of a ruthless woman out for blood.  Karma  might be where Swift got the most out of that glitter gel pen. using the chorus to extol all the things karma is for her — her boyfriend. a god. the breeze in her hair on the weekend. It s frothy. catchy fun. Has Taylor Swift ever been more Taylor Swift than when she declares  Karma is a cat / Purring in my lap  cause it loves me ?The most glaring letdown on  Midnights  is the barely there Lana Del Rey feature on  Snow on the Beach.  an otherwise dreamy. pleasant song that relegates Del Rey s vocals to backup work. Mastermind.  the final song on the album. is a building. meditative admission that Swift has orchestrated her relationship from the beginning:  What if I told you I m a mastermind? / And now you re mine / It was all by design. Later she reveals all the planning was born out of a need to make sure people loved her. a theme she s explored on previous albums.  I m only cryptic and Machiavellian  cause I care.  she croons. closing out  Midnights  with the lyrical equivalent of a Cheshire cat smile.It s a tidy comparison to Swift as an artist. Her intimate songs feel like unabashed. unfiltered confession. it s only when the curtain is blown back a bit that we remember we re hearing exactly what she wants us to. Luckily for us. she doesn t miss.,Entertainment News

The glitz and glamour of entertainment is nothing without the people who dress today s biggest stars. For  Who s Behind the Clothes.  HuffPost spotlights stylists and costume designers who have delivered some of our favorite celebrities or characters  most memorable looks. Read my interview with Flo Milli s stylist Jenna Tyson.Before Colleen Morris-Glennon led costume design on the hit HBO series  Industry.  she styled the  Queen of Disco  Donna Summer while working at MTV in her mid-20s. And before that. Morris-Glennon was an 8-year-old in Jamaica enamored with the clothing in  West Side Story  — and taller than most her age.  How I started making clothes is actually making it for myself. because I didn t want to look like a ‘high water girl.  My dad s favorite line was. ‘You expecting a flood?   Morris-Glennon. who is 5 10 . said with a laugh. recalling pants that fit like capris.It was working with the late Summer — dressing her for performances. a 1999 Genre magazine shoot and more — that inspired Morris-Glennon to do more than styling. Once the  TRL  era took off. the British-Jamaican stylist knew it was time to transition out of live television. That leap of faith turned her into the triple threat she is today. With over 30 years in fashion and over 20 years of television and film expertise. the London native is bringing the art of tailoring back to television. Morris-Glennon has worked on the off-Broadway musical rendition of  Rent.  the 2004 film  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and. notably.  Bolden.  a 2019 movie based on the life of New Orleans jazz musician Buddy Bolden. I ended up becoming assistant designer. then after a while. I got promoted to a costume designer  thanks to the film s director. she said.  I got to really take all my experiences of fabrics. construction. knowledge of design and costumes and put it into that piece. That s when I realized I m not doing anything else but costume designing ever again. Morris-Glennon talked to HuffPost about her journey through costume design and why working on  Industry  was a match tailor-made in heaven.From working with Donna Summer to leading costume design on  Industry.  how do you bridge the differences between styling for the stage versus television? With styling. especially. it is an absolute collaboration between you and your client. It is not just what you think. it has to be what the client likes. what the client is comfortable wearing. Because you might have an idea that this person will look so good in this item. and they go.  Actually. I don t like my arms out.  You have to work with those instances. Then there is the stage. That means very different fabrications. That means things that will stand up to hard work. stretch. It s so much more thought that goes into styling than people actually realize. It is an art form. and it s so much harder because you have to build a relationship with your clients. They have to trust you in a way because you re putting them in something that they re going out into the world in. No one s gonna say.  Ooh. what stylist did that?  They re going to go.  What the hell is she wearing?  There is a trust that has to come between you and your clients as a stylist. It is about your book: Who can you call? But also it depends on the actor or the celebrity because if they re big enough. they also open doors for you.What was it like working with Donna Summer? I miss her every day. She was the kindest. sweetest soul. She was an amazing human being. Within five minutes of being in her presence. you forget who she is. because she s just another person talking to you. She gave me such confidence. When I styled her for a magazine called  Genre.  it was the first time I worked with her. I was working with a stylist Jimmy Hanrahan. who then couldn t do it. and he gave me the project. I was so nervous. because I m in my 20s and I knew. in my head. I wasn t at the caliber to be styling Donna Summer. She made me feel absolutely comfortable. Being a West Indian. when you re going for a shoot with Donna Summer. you ve got to dress up. So I did. and I was wearing something that I designed myself. She was like.  What is that? Why am I not wearing that?  I was like.  Oh no. no. no. I made it. It s not good enough for you. I made it.  She goes.  What does that mean. Colleen? Did you design and make it?  I said yes and she goes.  Then you re a designer.  I remember that day so well. She held my hand and she goes.  You need to own it.  She felt more of a friend than a client. Every time I spent with her and her husband were moments I will treasure and never. ever take for granted that I got to work with her. The most iconic pieces I did for her were pieces that she wore for the VH1 Divas in 1998. My mom and I made those costumes. I ll always love that. She was like.  Would you like to do my build my costumes for ‘Divas?   Meanwhile. I had Dolce & Gabbana. all these designers calling me for her to wear them. and she was like.  No. I ll wear you. Tell me a little about your journey to costume design. Who inspired you to enter the industry?My first and always No. 1 reason for being in this industry is my mother. When I was growing up. my mother was a really amazing dressmaker. I just idolized her in every way. For my 4th birthday. I got a play sewing machine. so I sat beside her and her machine with my hand wheeling. making doll s clothing. That s where it really started. In costume design. it would be Irene Sharaff. the costume designer who did the original  West Side Story.  The first time I watched that film. my mum remembers it because the image of those costumes and Rita Moreno in that lavender dress was my moment of knowing I wanted to do that. It wasn t until I returned back to England in the  80s that I saw  West Side Story  in color. and saw the lavender dress with all the layers of beauty underneath it for real. That was my first moment of really wanting to be in costume. not knowing how that would work. Growing up in England. there was never really an outlet for costume design. It was never something that I thought of. So I went into fashion design. which was also a great love of mine. went to university. got my master s degree. worked with a master tailor from Savile Row. became a tailor and kind of fell into costume design by accident. which is great. What was your experience like attending Central Saint Martins? Growing up. I remember watching  Project Runway.  and hearing what an esteemed institution it is.My educational journey was from being in art school in my actual school. I was lucky enough to have a really good art teacher who took an interest in. then. my drawings. Then going to college and working on that. but I really wanted to go to Central Saint Martins. I never really thought I had any hope of going. but that was like reaching for something that you know you can t possibly reach — and I got in. I have to admit. it wasn t the most enjoyable experience as a person of color. I feel like I survived it. You re talking about the late  80s. early  90s. and there weren t many people of color.I left there kind of jaded and unsure of what to do next. I luckily went to see my mum in America after my parents divorced. I went to a nightclub and met this amazing man: Jimmy Hanrahan. who was then the head stylist at MTV. That was the first time I felt like I belonged. I couldn t believe that they would pay me money to go shopping. I had no clue what it meant. and I enjoyed it so much. I was there for so many years. That really. for me. was more my actual training because that was the first time I really worked with a lot of beautiful clothing. and realized how much people didn t know about construction. That enabled me to get work that I would never dream of getting. I was the stylist and costume designer for Donna Summer. The knowledge of construction will always be central to what I do. My career really started in New York. when I moved to New York in the early  90s.How did your Jamaican parents respond when you said you wanted to pursue a career in costume design?My mum was totally into it. She comes from that very artistic background anyway. My mum was always like.  You can do whatever you want to do. Put in the work. you can do it.  I wanted to just make fun clothing as a kid and she s like.  No. this is how you do it. This is what you do. No. you re not going to finish it by putting a pin in it and running out the door — you re going to finish it.  My mum really taught me the art of finishing what you start and making sure I had the ability to make clothing. not just to design something on a piece of paper and say.  Yes. this is beautiful.  So that was her job. My dad? Not for it. He didn t see the value in it. He was always very artistic. he comes from a background of farming. but he was a brilliant landscape artist. It took until he was in his 40s to get any work as a landscape artist. so he did not want me to go through that. He didn t perceive a little Black girl. working class. ever being able to do what I m doing now. I realized he wasn t mad. It was fearful. the thought of me not having an education that I can use and move forward. It took years for me to realize he wasn t angry with me. He was just afraid.How would you describe your personal sense of style. and how has your Caribbean heritage impacted it? My personal style stems from my parents. My mom was kind of bohemian. She loved reggae music in the  70s. which when Bob Marley started. it was not accepted in the West Indies. My mom was always that bell-bottoms-wearing. Afro woman. My mum was always that kind of earthy. organic personality. My dad was far more rigid. My dad wore suits to the cinema. He believed in a suit. he liked hats and walking sticks. It s quite funny to grow up with these very different parents. so I guess that s why I love tailoring. but I also love draping. My dress sense is a mood dress sense. I wouldn t say I have a sense of style per se. I definitely love classical clothing. so I will always be seen with a jacket. something tailored and then something soft. I love fluidity. and I also love structure. It s really how I feel on that day. If I m feeling slender and feeling good. then I ll go crazy. If I m not. always tailoring. I m covering everything. It s quite funny because growing up in England. I wore a lot of black. Then when I moved to America — where they actually have summers — I started wearing more color. which was kind of wild. I never thought I would wear color. In the winters. I m definitely more muted. I just think black is the best color anyway. Everyone s like.  Black is not a color.  and I m like. yes it is!What was the hardest part about transitioning from tailoring into costume design as a Black professional in the industry?It was very hard for me because no one wanted to help. Everyone was like.  Oh. but you re such a good tailor. If you become a designer. then I ll lose my job.  It was quite interesting. the lack of help there was for a person of color. I had to literally go out and go in through the back door to get in. Even after I did that job. it was still hard for me to find work as a designer. I had to come back to England to get work. It s been a challenge. I still haven t worked in America again since as a designer. I hope I will. but it s a hard climb. It s much more open now. and I m relieved. I m sad for the circumstances that it took for them to see Black people. not just in our industry. but so many industries. It feels great that we re doing it. but there is such a bitter aftertaste to realize what it took to be seen.I m very happy to see all the Black people that are now these HODs — head of departments — costume designers. production designers. directing. all these positions now. But I am hoping that it comes with support. I m lucky enough that I ve been in this industry for a very long time. from your PA to your costume designer. That is my great fear now. with making sure there is help for them as they re pushed forward. because it s hard to go from not getting anything to getting everything. If there s no infrastructure set up to support you. you re set up to fail. Then afterward. what they will now say is.  Oh. they couldn t do it. Tell me about your journey to  Industry  — and mastering the  Stealth-Wealth  aesthetic that Vogue attributes to you.I worked on only the second season. When I got interviewed by Mickey Downs. Konrad Kay and the showrunner David P. Davis. they asked me to watch the first season before I did the interview. I watched the first season — loooooved  Industry  — but I could see what I could do to change it. I just spoke to them and I was like.  I know you want it to stay exactly the same. But I think you need to change it just a little bit. I find it doesn t look wealthy enough.  That doesn t mean different colors. that doesn t mean anything but it means a cut of clothing. especially in the men s suits. It means that cut. They were very adamant about keeping it real. But when you look at those finance and banker guys. especially the older guys. they ve been in the business so long. Back in the day. apart from in the last 10 years maybe. before then. most of those suits were from Savile Row. They have learned how to dress well from the tailors who are making their suits. As for the cuts. they ve learned that from them. I said there just needs to be that element of wealth within the clothing. It was easy for me to do that being a tailor. That was second nature.I mean. this show was literally tailor-made for me to do. It was making sure there is an echelon or layers of what the suits. especially. would look like. from your first years to your third years to the guys in the offices upstairs. There has to be an absolute stepping stone where you can see the difference in cut. in fabrics. in the way they wear it. in the size of the jacket. Because some of the younger guys will have the wealthy jackets. but it won t be the right fit and won t be the right cut. I definitely noticed that sort of haphazard neatness with Harry Lawtey s character. Robert Spearing. Robert is trying so hard to find his way. period. and it s evident in how he dresses. Who was your favorite character to style on the series?I want to say Harper. Harper is such a complex character. There s so many layers to Harper. I have to say I enjoyed the fact that she was American. She was in England. I enjoyed the fact that she was basically working class. and just trying to get in there and trying to do this job that she knows she s good at. The first season. she had the  off the boat  look. I don t think she was prepared for the world that she was entering. especially in Britain with the class system. It s a world! She learned that quickly. which is why she and Robert got on so well. Because he s working class. She s working class. and they got each other. They got the angst. they got the pain.He definitely has that big brother thing with Harper. They are one of my favorite relationships in the show from the first season. I loved costuming Harper. giving her from the first year to the third year. She spent a long time living with Yasmin. so she learned so much from just living with Yasmin that she would have not learned in years of living in England. Yasmin is royalty. she s a Chelsea girl. she s an heiress. she comes from money. Whether Harper realized it or not. she picked up on that. I definitely kept her clothing very much like she was in the first season: very clean. very concise. The color palette did not waver much. because Harper doesn t care about that. Whereas Yasmin incorporated a lot more color and was far more playful.Because Yasmin was like.  Okay. I suffered the first year under Kenny. I m not doing that anymore.  And she came back with that attitude. The great thing is they had the year off at home. so they had time to think and to be. She just came back. and she was like.  No. Speaking of clothes. were there specific labels. designers or brands you pulled and frequented for the series? Who are some of your personal favorites?I m definitely a fan of Margiela. I put a bit of Margiela on Harper. because I find the cut of the clothing is very Harper. When she was in Berlin. that beautiful coat she was wearing was a Margiela coat. I frequent Yves Saint Laurent for Yasmin — of course. she had the best labels. Hello. it s Yasmin. Rishi was also another label whore. because he is the male label whore. I used a lot of Moncler on him. Eric was a lot of Brioni. he was like old school. like Hugo Boss. There s something about Hugo Boss I love because they have like no other brand of men s tailoring. to me. where they have from the very expensive to the affordable. Between the first-year students and the echelon at the top. I was able to use Boss. They were very helpful to us. they gave us discounts. I loved Rupert Sanderson for shoes. always Stuart Weitzman for shoes. I m a fan of the old-school French labels because no matter what. no matter how modern they get. there s always that sense of classic to them. You don t feel like an idiot wearing it two years from now. I m not a fan of throwaway fashion. I would rather buy last season s designer wear than this season s because that s what I can afford. I grew up that way. I believe in classics. I believe in good fabrics. Not all of us can afford designer labels — I certainly don t — I believe in buying last season s something. But tailoring it makes or breaks an outfit.What is one of your fondest memories designing on the  Industry  set?Our budget was not big. It looks like it was big. It was not. I had my kit. which is basically previous collections of my clothing. with me. I beg. borrowed. called in favors to really get the show to look as it should. One of my favorite memories was Celeste s character because she s supposed to look so expensive. I was like.  How much is our budget for Celeste? Okay. this should be interesting.  I was like.  You know what? I m gonna go grab everything I ve ever designed out of my kit.  We had nothing for her and during the fitting. I m like.  We re gonna throw something on the wall. and something will fit.  [Katrine De Candole] walked into the room. and everything she put on fit her perfectly. I was standing there with my supervisor. Sophie. I looked at Sophie. Sophie looked at me. and she was just like.  How is this possible? So. 90% of what she s wearing is literally from my past collections and from my kit. That was such a money-saving experience because then I could put more money on the other characters. That was a moment of zen. That will never happen again in my career. where literally we had too much clothing. We went from having nothing to too many looks for her. The Chanel suit [she wore]. we made that because there s absolutely no way Chanel is going to lend us clothing — and obviously. we can t afford it. I literally had the Chanel fabric that I ve had in my kit for maybe 10 years and was like.  We re building her Chanel suit.  That was the moment that I enjoyed the most: being able to get her things out of nowhere. out of nothing. What are you working on now. and where do you hope your career goes next?What I m working on now is a series called  Hijack  with the ever-so-lovely Idris Elba. He s absolutely lovely. It s very hard being a Black designer. getting to do British period. I would love to do period. Tailoring and contemporary comes from my knowledge of fashion. but what I love to do as a designer is definitely period. I would love to do something that s period-based but in actual fact. If it s a good project. I don t care. I just want to do good projects.  Industry  was a marriage made in heaven. It really was.,Entertainment News

Meghan Markleher stint on Deal or No Deal ArchetypesThe Duchess of Sussex said on Tuesday s episode of the Spotify and Archewell series that she  was still really grateful as an auditioning actress  to have a job as a  briefcase girl  on the game show. which she appeared on in 2006. didn t like feeling forced to be all looks and little substance.  here were times when I was on set at ‘Deal or No Deal  and thinking back to my time working as an intern at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina Buenos Aires.  she said.  And being in the motorcade with the secretary of treasury at the time and being valued specifically for my brain.  I was being valued for something quite the opposite.  the royal added. Meghan described the beautifying process that would take place before each taping. where the girls would line up and go through stations for putting on fake eyelashes. getting extensions put in. or adding padding to their bra.She said her fellow  briefcase girls  were also given weekly spray-tan vouchers. as  there was a very cookie cutter idea of precisely what we should look like.   It was solely about beauty. And not necessarily about brains.  She also said there was one detail related to her time on the show that she  will never. never forget.   There was a woman who ran the show and she would be there backstage and I can still hear her.  the duchess said.  She couldn t properly pronounce my last name at the time. and I knew who she was talking to because she would go ‘MAR-KELL SUCK IT IN! MAR-KELL SUCK IT IN.   I ended up quitting the show.  Meghan said.  Like I said. I was thankful for the job. but not for how it made me feel ― which was not smart.   I was surrounded by smart women on that stage with me. but that wasn t the focus of why we were there and I would end up leaving with this pit in my stomach.  the former  Suits  actress added.

Meghan said she thinks she didn t ever have the winning briefcase on the show. joking that she had the  ill-fated number.   Which for some reason. no one would ever choose.  she told the outlet.  I would end up standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down.  ,Entertainment News

I ve been so appreciative and had those conversations with her like. thank God. she saw what I didn t see.  standout looks unmatched creativityTia Adeolaa custom. gold-encrusted leotardPaper magazine cover Before Tyson became a stylist to the rap stars. she was a bright-eyed graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology s millinery program. Hailing from California. she moved to New York City during Rihanna s  Rated R  era. In an effort to find the  So Hard  singer s stylist. Tyson began researching fervently. landing upon Mariel Haenn. Tyson learned that Haenn acquired Rihanna as a client through none other than Misa Hylton. an award-winning fashion industry pioneer who has styled Lil  Kim. Mary J. Blige and countless other Black icons.  When I started researching Misa. I was just mind-blown from all the things that she had done. like her creative direction on the ‘Crush on You  video.  Tyson said. referencing Lil  Kim s iconic 1997 music video.  I was like. ‘Mariel is great. but Misa Hylton s who I want.   In summer 2012. Tyson enrolled in Hylton s critically acclaimed eponymous fashion academy — and there. Tyson s life changed.With the release of Flo Milli s sophomore album  You Still Here. Ho?  and the hilarious skits that accompanied its rollout. the 22-year-old musician from Alabama became a style starlet. Ahead of Flo Milli s debut tour launching Oct. 17. Tyson talked to HuffPost about her stylist journey. barriers that Black stylists have to overcome and what it s like working with Flo Milli. You ve styled or assisted so many of Flo s iconic looks. from her Paper magazine cover to her  Flosephine Baker  shoot. It s no secret that Flo Milli is a creative visionary and conceptual queen. especially with her latest album rollout. How do you bring her visions to life with clothes and converge them in a way that makes sense for the artist. while continuing to push the needle?[By] taking my time. I ve worked with Misa for so long. so when it was time for that Paper magazine cover. it came together in so many different ways — but conceptually. paying attention for years to her creative process. When it was something that Misa allowed us all to come together and figure out the concepts for. it was me. her daughter Madison. and Misa that came together with those concepts. She has a very particular creative process. We were working with Diesel. and they were sponsoring that Paper magazine shoot. Another good friend of mine. Nikki Martinez. is a consultant at Diesel and we came up with the upcycled piece of it. We needed so much denim. and they only had a roll. so Nikki was like.  We have all this old-season denim you can take.  That was just using your relationships. working with people. and not having an ego … It s so stressful. It s so crazy. then it comes together and you re like.  Whew. OK. this was great.  especially being able to do all the aspects that we did. coming back to being a Black woman. Flo has an amazing manager. who s also a creative: Ebonie Ward. She is very integral in coming up with a lot of the creatives for Flo. She also is kind of like a silent killer. she watches. she plots. she puts things together. She was a huge part of Flo s rollout. It s a lot of work. but it s passion-fueled because I m fortunate enough to work with young. Black female creatives. It s rare. and we re continuing to push the envelope. we re continuing to create opportunities in hopes that there are people that come behind us that want to do similar things. It s an incredible opportunity to be able to work with someone like Ebonie. because we re not just hypersexualizing everything that Flo is doing. Everything is so methodical. everything makes sense. and everything has passion behind it. That. in and of itself. is inspiring. because no matter the roadblocks or the hardships. you know that it has heart. it has soul. Sometimes Twitter responding gives you everything that you need. It s better than getting writeups in fashion magazines. It s like.  Well. we re touching the people.  That s the pulse. that s the beat of the world. How would you describe Flo s style? You brought up an excellent point about how you re leaning into the rap princess aesthetic. while also not trying to hypersexualize her. How do you make sure that you re hitting the mark with each client. from Future to Gunna? With Future and Gunna. I really just follow Bobby [Williams ] lead. He s an incredible. one-of-a-kind stylist. It s always nice to have that female and male perspective. so on Bobby s projects. if needed. I just bring my female perspective for those things. and learn as much as I can from him because he s worked with so many different people. With Flo. she has great style. she has an evolving style. I think the best thing about her is that she loves so many different things. like a true creative does. We re able to really have range and do a lot of different things as you can see from  Roaring 20s  to  Conceited.  She s willing to tap into different aesthetics. the same way she has different sounds. she ll play with different fashion. which I think is great. Her being so young. she has so much time to tap into every type of style that there is. We like to take our time with her. aesthetically. so that she has somewhere to go. If she just jumps into one aesthetic or something super sexy now. then where is she going to grow to? I think it s important to let her be her age. work with that. and let it be organic. She s a 22-year-old girl. so it s letting her be 22. Tell me about your journey to styling. What was your inspiration or impetus for entering the industry?I ve been in the business for 10 years. This is actually my 10-year anniversary of attending the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy. so that s one of my first and most beloved mentors. I was one of the first students to ever attend her school in New York. I grew up in Orange County. California. I went to a performing arts high school. and I moved to New York when I was 21 to start chasing my dreams of being in fashion. My biggest inspiration at that time was  Sex and the City  and Patricia Field. It doesn t get any better than that. just the range that she had on that show. I read an article at the time that said that her biggest inspiration was New York City as a backdrop. so I stopped everything in California and came to the big city.Did you find that there was a gap in how West Coast style translates on the East Coast?Being from Orange County or just Southern California. it s very lax. chill. kind of like surfer vibes. I was more into vintage at that time. so I liked high fashion designers like Givenchy and Balenciaga. but also the classic silhouettes and girly. feminine aesthetics and proper dressing. It s night and day. I think that the real style. the authenticity that they have on the East Coast. specifically in New York. was something that was most inspiring to me. especially because it s so culturally diverse. I had never experienced that in this way. meeting Afro Latinos and Afro Caribbeans and seeing that kind of melting pot. What I love the most about New York is that it s about the authenticity of your character and your style. So if you re cool. you re cool. If you can dress. you can dress. It wasn t about like. all the extra fluff.How would you characterize or describe your personal style now. and how has it shifted over the years?It s shifted pretty drastically. I tried to incorporate some of the older vintage that I have. but I m a streetwear fanatic now: Japanese designs. some American fashion — everyone loves Rick [Owens]. But I love streetwear. I love oversized. I love Margiela. Simone Rocha. I like wearable art if it s comfortable. Then. I like Black designers like Denim Tears. Marni for cozy vibes. I like streetwear because I think that we live in a time that s hypersexualized. so I like to play on comfort and cool aesthetics. but I m also a little bit older now. I ve had my time wanting to be sexy and wearing dresses. but now I just like to be a little more serious and focused. I will switch it up and dress up if that s what it calls for. Who instilled your love for clothing and fashion? My grandfather had always influenced me. He has really immaculate style. He s very particular about his aesthetic. his clothes. He s very clean. he loves everything about grooming. skin care and fragrance. I took a lot of that from him and that was like a big part of my childhood. When it was my birthday. he would always take me shopping. That instilled a lot of my pride about my style. and taking care of my material possessions. Could you tell me a little bit about your relationship to Misa. and how that s developed over the years? As I got to know Misa and grew my relationship with her. she really just helped shape my career. seeing the things that I was good at. and seeing the things that I lacked. At the time. I was just like.  Why hip-hop? Why rappers? Why do I need to do these things when you know where my passion lies?  But in the past five years. I ve been so appreciative of those conversations with her. Thank God she saw what I didn t see. She pushed me in this direction because it s really changed the trajectory of my career and my life. especially now being in a full circle moment. working with my first independent client that s a female rapper. It s great to be a part of Flo Milli s legacy. then play on all the different lines of being girly and feminine and having those essential rapper attributes.When you started your career. what were some of the hardest obstacles? The most constant issue as a Black stylist with Black clients is sourcing. Until you re at the height of your career. people don t want to lend and support. We do get a lot of support from certain brands and I very much appreciate that. but there are other brands that we don t get that support from. We have to just buy it. and if we don t buy it. we won t have it. Although we push the culture forward and we are the influence. they still don t give us the same support and respect that they should. Because of that. since the pandemic. I ve been fortunate enough with Flo to work specifically with brands that do support her and with Black-owned brands. We re able to stay in that space. and it s intentional. because they ve supported us. so we want to continue to support them as everyone in the scenario grows. As an aspiring stylist and an assistant. the thing that people maybe don t pay attention to enough is how much time assisting takes. It takes going through some things. it takes really committing to being an assistant. To learn how to be a leader. you have to follow. It s learning from people — good. bad or ugly — what you need to navigate in the industry: the skill set that you need. the work and determination that you need. the capital that you need. I think it looks so glamorous and it seems like such an incredible job. It s not just artistic. it s not just creative. at the base of it. it s a business. So. it s having the patience to wait until it is your time and up until that time being able to pour into somebody else s career as an asset and help them while learning. Vera Wang said it took her so long to start her company because she was assisting and she was being paid to learn. I look at the last 10 years of my career in a similar way. I was being paid to learn under some very incredible people. but I think it s the humility that you probably don t see.Who are some clientele you would like to add to your roster? Where do you see yourself going next?I would like to get more into the athlete space. and have both male and female clients. I d love to have the gauge of being able to broaden my range. I love artists. but I think having too many artists can be a little tricky. I would like to do more creative direction. working with brands. and doing more design.I was just the assistant costume designer for  Power Book II: Ghost.  the second season. That was an incredible opportunity and experience. I did that with Eric Archibald. so that was a cool eight months. I wouldn t mind doing something else that is costume design — and that s something else I love about Flo because she s so multifaceted. She s going into the acting space with her visuals. and it s so great that we re able to dabble in costume design. too. Will you be joining Flo Milli on tour?I ll be there for the first 10 days.What does tour prep look like for you as a stylist?It s intense. I ve been on a lot of tours. though. so I m fortunate enough to already have a base of it. You re making sure that there s a look for every city. then a fine line of giving her a range of options for when she wants to have options. But we re still sticking to a costume and a silhouette so that her audience gets the same show every night. I think aesthetically it s importantly to give the same costumes as well so that it feels the same and no one feels like they got a different experience.You ve talked about how you ve wanted to maintain uniformity in the show. but is sourcing difficult because of the fact that it is a tour? Do you need multiples of a garment or are you constantly washing the same pieces?Sometimes you do want to have something different for each date. but it s not realistic. It doesn t matter where you are in your career. What you re supposed to do on tour as an artist is have a costume. so you should have costumes that interchange color palettes but then they get cleaned on your off days. Especially for Flo being her first tour. her breakout tour. so we re just getting warmed up and just getting started. Once she gets to that larger space. we ll really have all the surprises and the glitz and the glamour. But I think for this one. since she was a COVID artist. it s important that she is able to connect with her fans and be comfortable and give a good show. She is Gen Z. she s a real rapper and she likes to get in the audience.Can you describe what we ll expect from Flo Milli s style on tour?I wanna say her tagline [i.e.. Flo Milli Shit!]. but you re gonna see talent. you re gonna see artistry and you re going to see vibrations. I think it s important that it s relatable. I personally get tired of seeing everything be so costumey and everything mirroring each other. I don t like the fact that everyone looks the same. like all the female acts and artists seem to have one silhouette. all crystals. What you re gonna see with Flo Milli is what I hope you ve already seen. which is consistent with the Flo Milli aesthetic. You re definitely gonna see the Flo Milli flip and you re gonna see the elevation of her style. but it s still gonna feel like Flo. It s not gonna feel like a Broadway show. You re coming to see her rap and that s what you re gonna get.,Entertainment News
It s the evening before BravoCon 2022. and anticipation and excitement are in the air. I m at a party at the Freehand hotel in New York City. and the  Real Housewives -inspired cocktail menu has drinks like  The Dorit  and  Reasonably Shady.  Napkins displayed all over the room don former housewife Sonja Morgan s famous tagline:  I have a taste for luxury. and luxury has a taste for me.  A DJ is playing  Housewives  hits like  Feeling Jovani  and several people are taking photos with cutouts of housewives on sticks.This party is a little different from the other BravoCon pre-parties. though. This one is all about politics.  There are a lot of parallels between ‘Real Housewives  and politics — they re mean. there s drama. betrayals. alliances.  one attendee tells me. Progressives at the Working Families Party are using this party to launch their newest initiative: The Real Housewives of Politics. The goal is a multipronged approach to organize the  Real Housewives  fan base through social media. live events and watch parties.  We aren t going to organize every ‘Housewives  fan. but people come from all walks of life and there s a subsection of fans who wanna get political. wanna get active.  said Nelini Stamp. the originator of the idea and WFP s director of strategy and partnerships.  We want people to organize on the basic level. to get more engaged. to go vote. and to build community in the ‘Housewives  fandom. One of the team s biggest endeavors is building a following on the @rhopol Instagram page. where freelance content creators produce memes and reels that connect  Real Housewives  drama with politics. Election Day reminders and other current events.They ve also built connections with Bravo content creators specifically who ve promoted the page to their followers. Popular Bravo world meme account @BravoHistorian. which has nearly 200.000 followers. helped give away tickets to the launch party ahead of BravoCon.  Most people who watch Bravo are women or people who identify as LGBTQ+ and to see a bunch of progressive Bravo lovers come together and support is what we need right now because things are rough.  Samantha Bush. the woman behind the @BravoHistorian account. said at the event. Bush isn t any stranger to  Housewives  getting political. She infamously was attacked by conservative former housewife Kelly Dodd after Bush called out one of Dodd s friends using the  OK  sign. which has become a white power symbol. in a video. I think people are really scared to speak out sometimes. especially people who run a Bravo meme account because people will push back and be like. ‘I just come here for  Housewives.   but I ve always been vocal. ... I m not not going to speak up.  Bush said.  The Real Housewives  wasn t always political. but that changed in 2016 with the election of President Donald Trump. The ninth season of  The Real Housewives of New York City  took a political turn and was filmed during the 2016 election cycle. leading to frank political conversations among the ladies. Host Andy Cohen even put each housewife on the spot at that season s reunion and asked whom they had voted for. Bravo was forced to reckon with the lack of diversity in its franchises in 2020. The network added more women of color to casts. but these women are often the only nonwhite person in their franchise and forced to take on the burden of educating audiences and cast members on issues of race. Bravo fired  The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City  newbie Jennie Nguyen early this year after racist posts on her Facebook page surfaced. and while the network released a statement. it avoided having any conversation or acknowledgment play out on screen. After  RHONY  star Ramona Singer s horrific behavior at a Black Shabbat party. the network canceled the Season 13 reunion and rebooted the show.  I think [Bravo] should toe the line a bit more when it comes to ‘Real Housewives  and politics. because they re mimicking real life.  Bush said.  It s a missed opportunity. and that s why I m so glad there is this event tonight because it creates a safe space where you do integrate politics and ‘Real Housewives  because politics is integrated in everything. Even if you think it s not. it is. Stamp says the Working Families Party decided to tap in to pop culture a few years ago. but this is the first time it s done fandom organizing. It s not the first time a fandom has organized for political change. though. Most notably. K-pop fans and young TikTokers reserved masses of free tickets to a Trump rally in Tulsa. Oklahoma. that they had no intention of attending. Harry Potter fans started nonprofit Fandom Forward in 2005. formerly known as the Harry Potter Alliance. as a gateway for activism and to get fans more politically involved.  We ve done pop culture and we ve done organizing of artists and creatives. but I think the third piece we ve always wanted was getting into fandoms.  Stamp said.  But it took us two years to build the team and focus on which fandom we wanted to choose and ‘The Real Housewives  just made sense.  Right-wing extremists are increasingly using the internet and social media to radicalize people. and there is an entire network of conservative teens and young men who are paid to create and promote right-wing memes that reach millions.  There is online organizing that has been done on the left. but a lot of it has been spur of the moment and organic.  Stamp said.  There hasn t been an investment like there has been on the right of ‘we ve really gotta prioritize this.  Toward the end of the launch party. organizers rolled out a gorgeous. giant cake with an apple. peach and orange on top and cherry blossoms along the side. Stamp asked the crowd.  What day are we voting?  The room was silent before Stamp asked again. It wasn t long before the entire room was chanting:  November 8! ,Entertainment News

 I m sure you ll find a solution. honey.  These are the last words in director Julia Ducournau s 2016 film  Raw.  spoken by the father of Justine (Garance Marillier). an aspiring veterinarian and a cannibal. He says this after he reveals his bare chest. filled with old bite marks and scars left by her mother in familiar fits of passion.His bewildering statement is as much a gentle cry for help as it is a chilling confession that his daughter has the same carnal predilection as her mother — and that it will continue unless she finds another outlet.This scene comes to mind after watching  Bones and All  at the New York Film Festival this month. Director Luca Guadagnino s new film also centers a young woman named Maren (Taylor Russell) who simultaneously navigates new adulthood and the realization that she has an unruly hunger for human flesh. Is it a condition. a desire. or something else altogether?Neither film seems particularly interested in answering that question. which makes them both intriguing and — pardon the pun — difficult to digest. (Though if you consider this 2003 New York Times article. you might be more inclined to believe that it s a trait that can be inherited from your parents.)And for what it s worth. we learn that Maren s mother. like her counterpart in  Raw.  is also a cannibal.What makes both films so curious and enchanting. however. is how they examine a young woman s coming of age. when she s out on her own for the first time and contending with the new spaces she finds herself in ― love and relationships. being away from home. making decisions for herself.For Justine and Maren. that also means discovering you re a cannibal.There s a reason why the possibility of a solution to Justine s people-eating is left for the end of  Raw.  The film is more about who she is: a lifelong vegetarian. a new student on campus who grapples with hazing (she s forced to eat raw meat). a young woman drawn to an enticing young man along with the drinking and clubbing scenes.The further Justine departs from what is familiar to her. the more she descends into what appears to be her cannibalistic nature. Bones and All  doesn t try to reckon with this unusual trait either. putting an even finer point on how cannibalism is used in these two films. In more typical horror fare such as  The Silence of the Lambs  and  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.  it s often about shock value and shows up in characters firmly established as villains.But in  Bones and All  and  Raw.  these young. female cannibals are unquestionably the protagonists. and it seems less about what they do — feast on the human body — than about the way they fit into their surroundings and society at large. They manage to engage in this thirst with virtually no consequences.No one is thinking about a young. female cannibal. Instead. it s the fact that they re isolated and alone that makes them most vulnerable. They tread along the margins of society at a critical point in their lives when they don t have all the answers.It s what makes them so interesting to watch. Because you can see that being true for a cannibal. and also an experience most women would find very recognizable.That achievement. or at least the conversation both films strike up. is surprising. Because unlike Ducournau. neither Guadagnino nor screenwriter David Kajganich has the gendered experiences to fully understand a young woman s journey (they ve adapted the film from Camille DeAngelis  2015 novel). And certainly not that of a young Black woman like Maren.And yet there s an awareness that permeates  Bones and All.  Like Justine. Maren is suddenly and brutally awakened to the fact that she is a cannibal. and that she is considered in equal parts dangerous and in danger. That s not a totally bizarre thing to see in a horror film. For an example that screams  coming of age can be a real nightmare for young women and everyone around them.  1976 s  Carrie  comes to mind.But in the cannibalism subgenre to which  Bones and All  and  Raw  belong. the horror of the act is decentered. and the filmmakers seem to wrangle with its more metaphorical meanings tied to coming of age.For instance. within the first few moments of  Bones and All.  Maren is enjoying herself at an otherwise typical teenage sleepover when she takes her friend s finger. with its nail newly polished. and bites it off.She s horrified by her inclination and runs to her father (André Holland). who is all too accustomed to her habit. He s been covering up her cannibalism for years and soon abandons her out of fear and frustration.Maren is determined to find answers. though not in the form of a solution to her problem. Rather. she wants to know where this came from. and to figure out where she wants to go. Heading on a cross-country road trip. she is isolated because she s a cannibal in a world seemingly filled with non-cannibals.It isn t until she encounters Sully (Mark Rylance). an unhinged male counterpart. and Lee (Timothée Chalamet). a compassionate loner like herself with whom she finds love. that her world begins to open up. And the perils of young adult life as both a cannibal and an average human woman appear to blend.While  Bones and All  has a sweetness to it.  Raw  is decidedly more frenetic in every way. Ducournau drops us into a more chaotic and compulsive world where Justine. faced with perpetual hazing and the intense newness of her situation. is barely getting by.She has glimmers of common young adult life with casual sex. late-night parties and surprise exams. But she also has to contend with the mysterious cravings that she sometimes can t even remember having. And she can t really process it with anyone. even her sister. who is also a cannibal. so she just keeps going. She s flailing and things are beginning to spiral.But maybe this is what adulthood is. sometimes spinning out of her control.Both  Bones and All  and  Raw  seem to ponder this as they follow their young. female protagonists on separate but similar journeys. not necessarily about cannibalism but about themselves. It s a strange. dark and shockingly grounded path that might hit home for you. Bones and All  screened at the 2022 New York Film Festival and releases in theaters on Nov. 23.,Entertainment News

He resides in Santa Barbara.

In the eightRaúl CastilloCha Cha Real SmoothNetflixHustleThe InspectionNew York Theatre WorkshopAmerican (Tele)visionsElia Monte-BrownWhile working on  American (Tele)visions.  Cazares ― who is nonbinary ― came to view Castillo as a mentor. In turn. Castillo said the playwright has given him  everything I ever wanted  as a theater artist.  I d been saying for a while:  I don t think I will ever do a play again because no one s writing the roles I m excited about. and nobody needs to see my Stanley Kowalski.  said Castillo. referring to the role in  A Streetcar Named Desire  made famous by Marlon Brando.  Victor joked that they wrote my Stanley. which I love. Just to give birth to a new play is a teenage dream come true.  HuffPost caught up with Castillo and Cazares to chat about  American (Tele)visions  before it concluded its acclaimed New York run last week. Victor. the characters in  American (Tele)visions  are very representative of your intersectional identities. How much of your own experience informed the play?Cazares: The show has autobiographical elements. but the story is not autobiographical. I m a Mexican American person and I grew up on the border. I came out when I was 14 or 15. and my parents did not react positively. We were a religious family. so their reaction was:  Let s give Victor therapy to stop being gay.  But even if my parents had problems understanding. accepting and embracing my queer identity. they were acting out of what they felt was love. It was still not great. but it was love. I m happy to say we now have a good relationship. The people that we were 15. 20 years ago. those parents are not here anymore. Even though this family s poor. they still look good. There s a certain way in which poor Mexicans are depicted. and that was not my lived experience. If anything. we have to try harder precisely because of our socioeconomic status.Raúl. what was it about the show ― and specifically. the role of Octavio ― that resonated most with you as an actor?Castillo: Initially. I thought I was going to pass on the play. Then I read the script and felt that it was absolutely beautiful. I was stunned by how moving it was. and I d never read anything like it. [Director] Rubén Polendo had such a clear vision in terms of how he wanted to make this play happen. in terms of how he wanted to stage it and how he wanted to conduct the process. Then Victor spoke about their inspiration for the play. These are two Mexican American artists. and I don t run into Mexican American artists that are working at this level often. to be frank.I remember thinking to myself:  I have to do this play.  There hasn t been a day in the process that hasn t reaffirmed my decision. There s not a person in this company who isn t working at their top level and giving it their all.  American (Tele)visions  was originally set to premiere before the COVID-19 pandemic. Do you think there are themes in the show that land differently ― more deeply. even ― because of the two-year delay?Cazares: Because of the pandemic. we re coming out of a period of mourning. of really intense grief and a distancing that we had to have with people. Not being able to see your family and friends ... that s daily life for undocumented immigrants. They re separated from the people they left back home. So that isolation that they suffer as a result and that this family in the play suffers is more legible than it was before. Raúl. the play is being staged shortly before the release of your new movie.  The Inspection.  As an actor. is it challenging for you to move in between mediums? Castillo: I love both mediums for different reasons. and it s exciting to be back in the theater. [but] the first night we performed the play for an audience. I was terrified. It was an out-of-body experience because I hadn t done it for so long. Now. it just feels like the most natural thing. I started in theater. it s where I came up. I just got to see  The Inspection  for the first time. and I was so electrified by Gabrielle Union s performance as a mother who rejects her queer son. Because I m living in this space [playing] a man who s really broken by the loss of his son. it was heartbreaking to watch. But the film is beautiful. and I m incredibly proud of it. I m excited about these two stories coming to life at the same time. Victor. what are you most hopeful audiences take away from  American (Tele)visions ?laughsI m focusing on just having this story [and] having more people see this undocumented Mexican family. I would love to inspire other Mexican American kids to see themselves. to engage and to know that their stories are worth telling and that people want to see them. We deserve human rights. and part of that human right is having our stories told. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity and length.,Entertainment News
Jerry Lee Lewis. the untamable rock ‘n  roll pioneer whose outrageous talent. energy and ego collided on such definitive records as  Great Balls of Fire  and  Whole Lotta Shakin  Goin  On  and sustained a career otherwise upended by personal scandal. died Friday morning at 87.The last survivor of a generation of groundbreaking performers that included Elvis Presley. Chuck Berry and Little Richard. Lewis died at home in Memphis. Tennessee. representative Zach Farnum said in a release.Of all the rock rebels to emerge in the 1950s. few captured the new genre s attraction and danger as unforgettably as the Louisiana-born piano player who called himself  The Killer. Tender ballads were best left to the old folks. Lewis was all about lust and gratification. with his leering tenor and demanding asides. violent tempos and brash glissandi. cocky sneer and crazy blond hair. He was a one-man stampede who made the fans scream and the keyboards swear. his live act so combustible that during a 1957 performance of  Whole Lotta Shakin  Goin  On  on  The Steve Allen Show.  chairs were thrown at him like buckets of water on an inferno. There was rockabilly. There was Elvis. But there was no pure rock  n  roll before Jerry Lee Lewis kicked in the door.  a Lewis admirer once observed. That admirer was Jerry Lee Lewis.But in his private life. he raged in ways that might have ended his career today — and nearly did back then.For a brief time. in 1958. he was a contender to replace Presley as rock s prime hit maker after Elvis was drafted into the Army. But while Lewis toured in England. the press learned three damaging things: He was married to 13-year-old (possibly even 12-year-old) Myra Gale Brown. she was his cousin. and he was still married to his previous wife. His tour was canceled. he was blacklisted from the radio and his earnings dropped overnight to virtually nothing. I probably would have rearranged my life a little bit different. but I never did hide anything from people.  Lewis told the Wall Street Journal in 2014 when asked about the marriage.  I just went on with my life as usual. Over the following decades. Lewis struggled with drug and alcohol abuse. legal disputes and physical illness. Two of his many marriages ended in his wife s early death. Brown herself divorced him in the early 1970s and would later allege physical and mental cruelty that nearly drove her to suicide. If I was still married to Jerry. I d probably be dead by now.  she told People magazine in 1989.Lewis reinvented himself as a country performer in the 1960s. and the music industry eventually forgave him. long after he stopped having hits. He won three Grammys. and recorded with some of the industry s greatest stars. In 2006. Lewis came out with  Last Man Standing.  featuring Mick Jagger. Bruce Springsteen. B.B. King and George Jones. In 2010. Lewis brought in Jagger. Keith Richards. Sheryl Crow. Tim McGraw and others for the album  Mean Old Man. In  The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll.  first published in 1975. he recalled how he convinced disc jockeys to give him a second chance. This time I said. ‘Look. man. let s get together and draw a line on this stuff — a peace treaty you know.   he explained. Lewis would still play the old hits on stage. but on the radio he would sing country.Lewis had a run of top 10 country hits between 1967-70. and hardly mellowed at all. He performed drinking songs such as  What s Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me) . the roving eye confessions of  She Still Comes Around  and a dry-eyed cover of a classic ballad of abandonment.  She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye.  He had remained popular in Europe and a 1964 album.  Live at the Star Club. Hamburg.  is widely regarded as one of the greatest concert records.A 1973 performance proved more troublesome: Lewis sang for the Grand Ole Opry and broke two longstanding rules — no swearing and no non-country songs. I am a rock and rollin . country-and-western. rhythm and blues-singin  motherf――-.  he told the audience.Lewis married seven times. and was rarely far from trouble or death. His fourth wife. Jaren Elizabeth Gunn Pate. drowned in a swimming pool in 1982 while suing for divorce. His fifth wife. Shawn Stephens. 23 years his junior. died of an apparent drug overdose in 1983. Within a year. Lewis had married Kerrie McCarver. then 21. She filed for divorce in 1986. accusing him of physical abuse and infidelity. He countersued. but both petitions eventually were dropped. They finally divorced in 2005 after several years of separation. The couple had one child. Jerry Lee III.Another son by a previous marriage. Steve Allen Lewis. 3. drowned in a swimming pool in 1962. and son Jerry Lee Jr. died in a traffic accident at 19 in 1973. Lewis also had two daughters. Phoebe and Lori Leigh. and his survived by his wife Judith.His finances were also chaotic. Lewis made millions. but he liked his money in cash and ended up owing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Internal Revenue Service. When he began welcoming tourists in 1994 to his longtime residence near Nesbit. Mississippi — complete with a piano-shaped swimming pool — he set up a 900 phone number fans could call for a recorded message at $2.75 a minute.The son of one-time bootlegger Elmo Lewis and the cousin of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and country star Mickey Gilley. Lewis was born in Ferriday. Louisiana. As a boy. he first learned to play guitar. but found the instrument too confining and longed for an instrument that the only the rich people in his town could afford — a piano. His life changed when his father pulled up in his truck one day and presented him a dark-wood. upright set of keyboards. My eyes almost fell out of my head.  Lewis recalled in  Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story.  written by Rick Bragg and published in 2014.He took to the piano immediately. and began sneaking off to Black juke joints and absorbing everything from gospel to boogie-woogie. Conflicted early on between secular and scared music. he quit school at 16. with plans of becoming a piano-playing preacher. Lewis briefly attended Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie. Texas. a fundamentalist Bible college. but was expelled. reportedly. for playing the  wrong  kind of music. Great Balls of Fire.  a sexualized take on Biblical imagery that Lewis initially refused to record. and  Whole Lotta Shakin   were his most enduring songs and performance pieces. Lewis had only a handful of other pop hits. including  High School Confidential  and  Breathless.  but they were enough to ensure his place as a rock ‘n  roll architect. No group. be it (the) Beatles. Dylan or Stones. have ever improved on ‘Whole Lotta Shakin   for my money.  John Lennon would tell Rolling Stone in 1970.A roadhouse veteran by his early 20s. Lewis took off for Memphis in 1956 and showed up at the studios of Sun Records. the musical home of Elvis. Perkins and Cash. Told by company founder Sam Phillips to go learn some rock ‘n roll. Lewis returned and soon hurried off  Whole Lotta Shakin   in a single take. I knew it was a hit when I cut it.  he later said.  Sam Phillips thought it was gonna be too risque. it couldn t make it. If that s risque. well. I m sorry. In 1986. along with Elvis. Chuck Berry and others. he made the inaugural class of inductees for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The Killer not only outlasted his contemporaries but saw his life and music periodically reintroduced to younger fans. including the the 1989 biopic  Great Balls of Fire.  starring Dennis Quaid. and Ethan Coen s 2022 documentary  Trouble in Mind.  A 2010 Broadway music.  Million Dollar Quartet.  was inspired by a recording session that featured Lewis. Elvis. Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash.He won a Grammy in 1987 as part of an interview album that was cited for best spoken word recording. and he received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2005. The following year.  Whole Lotta Shakin   was selected for the Library of Congress  National Recording Registry. whose board praised the  propulsive boogie piano that was perfectly complemented by the drive of J.M. Van Eaton s energetic drumming. The listeners to the recording. like Lewis himself. had a hard time remaining seated during the performance. A classmate at Bible school. Pearry Green. remembered meeting Lewis years later and asking if he was still playing the devil s music. Yes. I am.  Lewis answered.  But you know it s strange. the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is. I know I am playing for the devil and they don t. ,Entertainment News

Hayley Williams saysIn 2018in 2020Still.  Misery Business  and its accompanying angst-filled album  Riot!  are what made Paramore famous. It s not often that a sophomore album puts any artist on the map. but after  Misery Business  reached the Top 100 songs. it cemented Paramore s place in music history. As longtime fan Megan Mann puts it.  This wasn t a sophomore slump. it was a triumph that catapulted them.  Fellow emo kid Christina Orlando feels the same way. saying  Riot!  is a  no skips album  — high praise in the music world in which every single song on a stand-alone album is so good that you listen to it the whole way through without skipping any.at CoachellaParamore s success seems easy. almost assured even. but when the band formed in 2004. having a frontwoman at the helm of a rock band was rare — and still is all these years later. That didn t stop the orange-haired Williams from pursuing her dreams and inspiring entire generations of women to chase after the things they want most. even when the world tells them not to. The thing is that Hayley was [one of] the only women in an incredibly male-dominated genre. I can t imagine what kind of shit she had to go through.  Orlando says.  No one could even compare with Hayley s talent. She is incredible on stage. her voice is undeniable ... so many of those bands died out after an album or two. but Paramore has had staying power. and so much of that is because Hayley is a fucking star. There s so much emotionality in her voice. so much power. There s no one else like her. Fifteen years later.  Riot!  remains a soundboard for fans who express themselves through music. For many. it s Paramore s particularly poignant lyrics that reflect a certain unease of the early aughts and for others it was the energy of the music that provided a much-needed outlet for pent-up emotions. I think for girls especially. Paramore just encapsulated a lot of feminine angst and rage that was simmering beneath the surface.  journalist De Elizabeth reflects.  Coming of age in the 2000s was a really unique and challenging time to be a girl. and I feel like Hayley Williams understood that. Her music felt like an olive branch to all of us. or a show of solidarity in some way. barelyAuthor and self-described superfan Alicia Thompson first heard Paramore s  Riot!  on a burned CD with a Sharpie-adorned track list scribbled atop it. She tells HuffPost this was a pivotal moment for her as a fan. so much so that she still has the cherished bootleg album and frequently listens to  Riot!  and other Paramore albums on repeat all these years later. In fact. she credits the band as  very instrumental  in establishing her career as a romance novelist. inspiring her to challenge herself to build characters and stories  around passion and yearning and anger and regret. because their songs are so emotional. Meanwhile. fans like Anna Osinska. who manages Paramore-Music.com. one of the band s oldest fan sites. have transformed their love of  Riot!  into a worldwide connection between fans.  It s been a journey with Paramore. the fan site I run was launched in 2009. Being around the band for like 15 years. growing up with them. being able to interpret the lyrics differently now and then when I was 14 is a gift I haven t had with any other band on such a level. I met so many amazing people thanks to the popularity of ‘Riot!  So many friendships wouldn t have happened.  she says.For many. the Parafamily is just another reason they ve dedicated their time and money to supporting the band.  Paramore has given us one of the most supportive and inviting fandoms that has ever existed and I am so grateful for it each and every day.  Cosmopolitan entertainment editor Tamara Fuentes tells HuffPost.Like many others. Fuentes still listens to Paramore on repeat all these years later. a true testament to the timelessness of the album and band itself. Still. when you find a band during a particularly vulnerable moment in your life. it can make nostalgic feelings bittersweet. ‘Riot!  came out right before a big moment in my life. I was getting heavily bullied at school and it was a very very rough time for me mentally.  Fuentes says.  ‘Riot!  allowed me to be able to channel that anger. pain. and even some of the happiness of the time over the years. ... It s one of the reasons why listening to the album alone can be hard because it brings up some of those memories. but it also shows me how much I ve changed and persevered since then. These are feelings Zach D. Humphrey knows all too well. Although a fan of the band. Zach listens to  Riot!  very occasionally due to the album s power to  jettison  them back to the past.  [It] makes the emotions of back then feel still so real and present. so I m careful about when to revisit those.  they say. Humphrey was raised in a  very far-right Christian environment.  and Paramore was one of the few bands that was considered  safe  to listen to and not considered  blasphemous.   ‘Riot!  was like this beacon that other teenagers were as fed up as I was. I felt very much like ‘a different kind of girl  even when I still identified as male and ‘Riot!  was a great avenue for a lot of those feelings.  they say.  Williams. like me. ended up divorcing herself from a lot of the toxic bits of Christianity that had ended up oppressing her so I ve related as she and Paramore changed things up so much every few years. Almost all fans of the group have one thing in common: They find inspiration in the band s lead singer. For Fuentes and Humphrey. it was discovering their identities when it comes to faith. For Elizabeth. it was Williams  transparency surrounding mental health. For fans like Tiera DiGiorgio and M.K. Lobb. the album was the power to get through the worst parts of adolescence. I got my dad to download [ Riot! ] on my pink iPod nano and it quickly became my favorite.  Lobb recalls of the album that fans have designated as one of the most iconic of all time.  It s still one of the few albums I listen to without skipping a single song.  She remembers blasting songs like  Fences  and  We Are Broken  in the back seat of her parent s car  bemoaning  the fact that her ninth grade crush didn t like her anymore.  ‘Riot!  brings back all the big feelings of being a teen. It accompanied me through so many rough times. but the songs also have the kind of power that made me feel like I could get through it.  she says.For DiGiorgio. who was a freshman in high school when the album came out.  Riot! was a  bright spot in an otherwise dark time.  In fact. the band was so pivotal in her own coming-of-age story that she says she isn t sure where she d be today if she hadn t found it.Paramore was also a way for  outsiders  to unite with others like them.  I was a very lonely kid.  Orlando says.  I was a little punk-goth weirdo at a prep school. but Paramore and similar bands brought me to My People.  They used to attend local shows as a teen and found a safe space away from the  bullying and estrangement  they felt at their high school. To this day. Orlando is still friends with some of the people they met at these shows.  Riot! was a lot of things to me at the time ... but mostly it was a connection with my friends.  Orlando says.  Emo was always about community for me. I felt so at home there. The timelessness of  Riot!  endures all these years later. And. if fans have their way. Paramore s legacy will last long after we re all gone — a classic like The Rolling Stones or The Beatles for future generations to lament teenage woes and understand their own emotions during the early stages of puberty and beyond. As Lobb puts it.  There are bands you grow out of as you get older. but this is not one of them. CORRECTION: A prior headline for this story incorrectly referred to  Riot  as Paramore s debut album.,Entertainment News

In the eightRaúl CastilloCha Cha Real SmoothNetflixHustleThe InspectionNew York Theatre WorkshopAmerican (Tele)visionsElia Monte-BrownWhile working on  American (Tele)visions.  Cazares ― who is nonbinary ― came to view Castillo as a mentor. In turn. Castillo said the playwright has given him  everything I ever wanted  as a theater artist.  I d been saying for a while:  I don t think I will ever do a play again because no one s writing the roles I m excited about. and nobody needs to see my Stanley Kowalski.  said Castillo. referring to the role in  A Streetcar Named Desire  made famous by Marlon Brando.  Victor joked that they wrote my Stanley. which I love. Just to give birth to a new play is a teenage dream come true.  HuffPost caught up with Castillo and Cazares to chat about  American (Tele)visions  before it concluded its acclaimed New York run last week. Victor. the characters in  American (Tele)visions  are very representative of your intersectional identities. How much of your own experience informed the play?Cazares: The show has autobiographical elements. but the story is not autobiographical. I m a Mexican American person and I grew up on the border. I came out when I was 14 or 15. and my parents did not react positively. We were a religious family. so their reaction was:  Let s give Victor therapy to stop being gay.  But even if my parents had problems understanding. accepting and embracing my queer identity. they were acting out of what they felt was love. It was still not great. but it was love. I m happy to say we now have a good relationship. The people that we were 15. 20 years ago. those parents are not here anymore. Even though this family s poor. they still look good. There s a certain way in which poor Mexicans are depicted. and that was not my lived experience. If anything. we have to try harder precisely because of our socioeconomic status.Raúl. what was it about the show ― and specifically. the role of Octavio ― that resonated most with you as an actor?Castillo: Initially. I thought I was going to pass on the play. Then I read the script and felt that it was absolutely beautiful. I was stunned by how moving it was. and I d never read anything like it. [Director] Rubén Polendo had such a clear vision in terms of how he wanted to make this play happen. in terms of how he wanted to stage it and how he wanted to conduct the process. Then Victor spoke about their inspiration for the play. These are two Mexican American artists. and I don t run into Mexican American artists that are working at this level often. to be frank.I remember thinking to myself:  I have to do this play.  There hasn t been a day in the process that hasn t reaffirmed my decision. There s not a person in this company who isn t working at their top level and giving it their all.  American (Tele)visions  was originally set to premiere before the COVID-19 pandemic. Do you think there are themes in the show that land differently ― more deeply. even ― because of the two-year delay?Cazares: Because of the pandemic. we re coming out of a period of mourning. of really intense grief and a distancing that we had to have with people. Not being able to see your family and friends ... that s daily life for undocumented immigrants. They re separated from the people they left back home. So that isolation that they suffer as a result and that this family in the play suffers is more legible than it was before. Raúl. the play is being staged shortly before the release of your new movie.  The Inspection.  As an actor. is it challenging for you to move in between mediums? Castillo: I love both mediums for different reasons. and it s exciting to be back in the theater. [but] the first night we performed the play for an audience. I was terrified. It was an out-of-body experience because I hadn t done it for so long. Now. it just feels like the most natural thing. I started in theater. it s where I came up. I just got to see  The Inspection  for the first time. and I was so electrified by Gabrielle Union s performance as a mother who rejects her queer son. Because I m living in this space [playing] a man who s really broken by the loss of his son. it was heartbreaking to watch. But the film is beautiful. and I m incredibly proud of it. I m excited about these two stories coming to life at the same time. Victor. what are you most hopeful audiences take away from  American (Tele)visions ?laughsI m focusing on just having this story [and] having more people see this undocumented Mexican family. I would love to inspire other Mexican American kids to see themselves. to engage and to know that their stories are worth telling and that people want to see them. We deserve human rights. and part of that human right is having our stories told. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity and length.,Entertainment News
 I m sure you ll find a solution. honey.  These are the last words in director Julia Ducournau s 2016 film  Raw.  spoken by the father of Justine (Garance Marillier). an aspiring veterinarian and a cannibal. He says this after he reveals his bare chest. filled with old bite marks and scars left by her mother in familiar fits of passion.His bewildering statement is as much a gentle cry for help as it is a chilling confession that his daughter has the same carnal predilection as her mother — and that it will continue unless she finds another outlet.This scene comes to mind after watching  Bones and All  at the New York Film Festival this month. Director Luca Guadagnino s new film also centers a young woman named Maren (Taylor Russell) who simultaneously navigates new adulthood and the realization that she has an unruly hunger for human flesh. Is it a condition. a desire. or something else altogether?Neither film seems particularly interested in answering that question. which makes them both intriguing and — pardon the pun — difficult to digest. (Though if you consider this 2003 New York Times article. you might be more inclined to believe that it s a trait that can be inherited from your parents.)And for what it s worth. we learn that Maren s mother. like her counterpart in  Raw.  is also a cannibal.What makes both films so curious and enchanting. however. is how they examine a young woman s coming of age. when she s out on her own for the first time and contending with the new spaces she finds herself in ― love and relationships. being away from home. making decisions for herself.For Justine and Maren. that also means discovering you re a cannibal.There s a reason why the possibility of a solution to Justine s people-eating is left for the end of  Raw.  The film is more about who she is: a lifelong vegetarian. a new student on campus who grapples with hazing (she s forced to eat raw meat). a young woman drawn to an enticing young man along with the drinking and clubbing scenes.The further Justine departs from what is familiar to her. the more she descends into what appears to be her cannibalistic nature. Bones and All  doesn t try to reckon with this unusual trait either. putting an even finer point on how cannibalism is used in these two films. In more typical horror fare such as  The Silence of the Lambs  and  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.  it s often about shock value and shows up in characters firmly established as villains.But in  Bones and All  and  Raw.  these young. female cannibals are unquestionably the protagonists. and it seems less about what they do — feast on the human body — than about the way they fit into their surroundings and society at large. They manage to engage in this thirst with virtually no consequences.No one is thinking about a young. female cannibal. Instead. it s the fact that they re isolated and alone that makes them most vulnerable. They tread along the margins of society at a critical point in their lives when they don t have all the answers.It s what makes them so interesting to watch. Because you can see that being true for a cannibal. and also an experience most women would find very recognizable.That achievement. or at least the conversation both films strike up. is surprising. Because unlike Ducournau. neither Guadagnino nor screenwriter David Kajganich has the gendered experiences to fully understand a young woman s journey (they ve adapted the film from Camille DeAngelis  2015 novel). And certainly not that of a young Black woman like Maren.And yet there s an awareness that permeates  Bones and All.  Like Justine. Maren is suddenly and brutally awakened to the fact that she is a cannibal. and that she is considered in equal parts dangerous and in danger. That s not a totally bizarre thing to see in a horror film. For an example that screams  coming of age can be a real nightmare for young women and everyone around them.  1976 s  Carrie  comes to mind.But in the cannibalism subgenre to which  Bones and All  and  Raw  belong. the horror of the act is decentered. and the filmmakers seem to wrangle with its more metaphorical meanings tied to coming of age.For instance. within the first few moments of  Bones and All.  Maren is enjoying herself at an otherwise typical teenage sleepover when she takes her friend s finger. with its nail newly polished. and bites it off.She s horrified by her inclination and runs to her father (André Holland). who is all too accustomed to her habit. He s been covering up her cannibalism for years and soon abandons her out of fear and frustration.Maren is determined to find answers. though not in the form of a solution to her problem. Rather. she wants to know where this came from. and to figure out where she wants to go. Heading on a cross-country road trip. she is isolated because she s a cannibal in a world seemingly filled with non-cannibals.It isn t until she encounters Sully (Mark Rylance). an unhinged male counterpart. and Lee (Timothée Chalamet). a compassionate loner like herself with whom she finds love. that her world begins to open up. And the perils of young adult life as both a cannibal and an average human woman appear to blend.While  Bones and All  has a sweetness to it.  Raw  is decidedly more frenetic in every way. Ducournau drops us into a more chaotic and compulsive world where Justine. faced with perpetual hazing and the intense newness of her situation. is barely getting by.She has glimmers of common young adult life with casual sex. late-night parties and surprise exams. But she also has to contend with the mysterious cravings that she sometimes can t even remember having. And she can t really process it with anyone. even her sister. who is also a cannibal. so she just keeps going. She s flailing and things are beginning to spiral.But maybe this is what adulthood is. sometimes spinning out of her control.Both  Bones and All  and  Raw  seem to ponder this as they follow their young. female protagonists on separate but similar journeys. not necessarily about cannibalism but about themselves. It s a strange. dark and shockingly grounded path that might hit home for you. Bones and All  screened at the 2022 New York Film Festival and releases in theaters on Nov. 23.,Entertainment News
Georgie Henley is done hiding her scars. The Chronicles of Narnia flesh-eating disease.  When I was 18 years old and in my sixth week of university. I contracted necrotizing fasciitis. a rare and punishing infection that nearly claimed my life and wrought havoc throughout my body.  Henley revealed. While the actor said she d spoken about her health privately. the social media post marked the first time she shared her journey publicly.  In order to prevent the amputation of my left hand and arm. I received grueling invasive surgery. and later extensive reconstructive surgery. which resulted in a series of skin grafts and scars.  she explained. Henley said it has  taken me a long time to heal both physically and mentally.  but that she was finally ready to talk about her battle and show her scars after years of hiding them.  My scars are not something to be ashamed of.  the 27-year-old said. alongside a photo showing her scars.  They are a map of the pain my body has endured and. most importantly. a reminder of my survival. They do not affect my capacity as an actor. and I m proud to be a person who has visible scars in this industry.  Henley s friends and fans praised the actor for sharing her story in supportive comments on the post.  Love you. geo.  wrote  The Crown  actor Emma Corrin. while model Charli Howard shared.

James Cordenin an Instagram postMcNally said it was rare for him to nix a customer. but he had banned Corden that day. He shared two examples of Corden s treatment of his staff and noted that the comedian had behaved similarly in another restaurant he previously owned. Cafe Luxembourg. several years ago.In one instance. in June. the British comedian apparently found a hair in his food and after eating his main course. showed the hair to the manager ― referenced as G ― who was  very apologetic.  Corden was extremely nasty to G. and said: ‘Get us another round of drinks this second. And also take care of all of our drinks so far. This way I [don t] write any nasty reviews in yelp or anything like that.   McNally wrote. citing a manager s report. On Oct. 9. Corden was at Balthazar with his wife. TV producer Julia Carey. for brunch. according to McNally. Carey ordered an egg yolk omelet with salad. A few minutes after they received the food. James called their server. M. K. and told her there was a little bit of egg white mixed with the egg yolk.  McNally said.  M. K. informed the floor manager. G. The kitchen remade the dish but unfortunately sent it with home fries instead of salad.  That s when James Corden began yelling like crazy to the server: ‘You can t do your job! You can t do your job! Maybe I should go into the kitchen and cook the omelette myself!   he wrote.McNally said the server was apologetic and brought the floor manager. G. over to the table. G returned the dish and after that.  everything was fine.  he said. adding that G also offered them champagne glasses to  smooth things out.  G said that Corden was pleasant to him but nasty to the server.  McNally wrote. adding that the server was  very shaken. A representative for Corden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,Entertainment News
Matthew PerryJulia RobertsFriends. Lovers and the Big Terrible ThingThe One After the Superbowl: Part 2in the U.K. s The TimesAs far as the  wooing  was concerned. Perry first sent Roberts  three dozen roses  along with a note that read:  The only thing more exciting than the prospect of you doing the show is that I finally have an excuse to send you flowers. Still. the  Pretty Woman  star wasn t completely sold ― at least not yet.  Her reply was that if I adequately explained quantum physics to her. she d agree to be on the show.  Perry said.  Wow.

Five years ago.The coming-of-age film follows a Sacramento. California. teenager nicknamed Lady Bird as she contends with a strained mother-daughter relationship and her desire to attend college on the East Coast despite her family s financial struggles. It was nominated for five Oscars and hailed as a necessary meditation on complicated family dynamics. as well as the trials and triumphs of girlhood.America Ferreratold the online magazine Remezclaincluded in the National Film RegistryAs the 20th anniversary of the film approaches. some of these Latinas spoke to HuffPost about the enduring relevance and legacy of the movie.  Wow. I ve never seen a Latina with chichos on screen.  Emily Jimenez. who s of Dominican descent and works in higher education. recalled thinking to herself when she first watched the film. According to Hollywood. you either have Sofía Vergara s body type. where you re curvy and super voluptuous with a flat stomach. or you re an older woman who s super round and plump and isn t a main character. It doesn t leave much room in between.  she said. As someone who s plus size. being able to see that on TV was crazy to me.  Jimenez added. referring to an infamous scene in which Ana. who s been repeatedly body-shamed by her mother. takes off her shirt in the middle of a boiling-hot dress factory in an act of defiance and self-preservation.  You re at work and you feel comfortable doing that. And it isn t just Ana who releases the burden of body shame in that scene. Her bravery amid the constant vocal disapproval of her body sets the tone for the other women in the factory — all of different shapes and sizes. with their own body hang-ups — and the women watching the film to do the same.  Aren t you embarrassed?  her mother. Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros). comments after Ana sheds her shirt in the sweltering heat.  Look at you — you look awful. … You would look beautiful without all that fat.  I happen to like myself.  Ana powerfully retorts.  I do want to lose weight. but part of me doesn t because my weight says to everyone: ‘Fuck you. … How dare anyone tell me what I should look like or what I should be when there s so much more to me than just my weight.  peddling diet culture I was in college when ‘Real Women Have Curves  came out and was dealing with disordered eating.  Rosa Gutierrez. who is Puerto Rican and works in health care. told HuffPost.  After seeing that scene. I just cried.  Gutierrez recalled gaining weight during her first year of college. only to return home for the holidays and be swarmed at the dessert table by family members instructing her to eat fruit instead of cake so she would lose the weight more quickly. All my life I d been told that something was wrong with me and that I had to fix it. and if I didn t. I wouldn t find a husband — similar to what America Ferrera s mom tells her in the movie.  Gutierrez said.  Even though I still struggled with disordered eating for a while after that [seeing the movie]. something clicked for me — like. ‘No. wait. there is more to me than the box people have been putting me in or the snap judgments people make about me and my body.   has yet to be retiredThat she s a first-generation Latina only solidified people s connection to the film.  My parents came from Mexico with basically nothing.  said Erica Guerrero. who works in the service industry.  They weren t unsupportive of me going to college like Ana s parents were. but they didn t understand it and couldn t help me with the process. Like Ana. Guerrero had an English teacher who encouraged her to apply to college — a relationship that she said  changed my life forever.  In  Real Women Have Curves.  Mr. Guzman (George Lopez) pushes Ana to apply to Columbia. which leads to her being accepted with a scholarship.  As a first-gen student. you feel so alone. There s so much you don t know.  Guerrero said.  You can be book smart. but if you don t have the cultural capital. you re screwed. So seeing her [Ana] gain access to this institution because she earned it. unlike her more privileged classmates. was relatable.  For Jimenez.  Real Women Have Curves  captures the cultural clash of being the  first-born American.  Ni de aquí. ni de allá.  she said. referencing an expression commonly used in Latino communities to denote the feeling of not being from either the U.S. or a family s home country. There s this expectation that you will fulfill your family s American dreams. but my version of the American dream doesn t look like what it does for my parents.  Jimenez added. Theirs was the dreams of survival and the white picket fence.  she continued.  My generation sees the American dream as equity and equality. as being accepted as who we are and not having to change our language. but getting to be authentic. Like so many movies that center Latinos. the broader reception of  Real Women Have Curves  suffered because it was released during a time when Latinos were considered even more of a niche audience than they are now.To be sure. the state of Latinos in Hollywood hasn t changed significantly since the film s release. Fewer than 6according to a 2021 report Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. The same research found that nearly 40% of top-billed Hispanic and Latino characters in that year s films were depicted as criminals — a stat that makes  Real Women Have Curves  even more outstanding as it shows East Los Angeles. a neighborhood that has always been portrayed stereotypically in film. with nuance and love.But if anything. that lack of initial mainstream accolades from the Hollywood powers that be has only heightened the importance of the movie for Latinas and inspired many of us to share this pivotal film with others.  When I was working in a high school after-school program. I showed it to the women s group. which was a mixed group of Latinas and Black women. and most of them had never heard of it.  Jimenez said.  It really resonated with them. just like it resonated with me. I saw myself in Ana.

Hayley Williams saysIn 2018in 2020Still.  Misery Business  and its accompanying angst-filled album  Riot!  are what made Paramore famous. It s not often that a sophomore album puts any artist on the map. but after  Misery Business  reached the Top 100 songs. it cemented Paramore s place in music history. As longtime fan Megan Mann puts it.  This wasn t a sophomore slump. it was a triumph that catapulted them.  Fellow emo kid Christina Orlando feels the same way. saying  Riot!  is a  no skips album  — high praise in the music world in which every single song on a stand-alone album is so good that you listen to it the whole way through without skipping any.at CoachellaParamore s success seems easy. almost assured even. but when the band formed in 2004. having a frontwoman at the helm of a rock band was rare — and still is all these years later. That didn t stop the orange-haired Williams from pursuing her dreams and inspiring entire generations of women to chase after the things they want most. even when the world tells them not to. The thing is that Hayley was [one of] the only women in an incredibly male-dominated genre. I can t imagine what kind of shit she had to go through.  Orlando says.  No one could even compare with Hayley s talent. She is incredible on stage. her voice is undeniable ... so many of those bands died out after an album or two. but Paramore has had staying power. and so much of that is because Hayley is a fucking star. There s so much emotionality in her voice. so much power. There s no one else like her. Fifteen years later.  Riot!  remains a soundboard for fans who express themselves through music. For many. it s Paramore s particularly poignant lyrics that reflect a certain unease of the early aughts and for others it was the energy of the music that provided a much-needed outlet for pent-up emotions. I think for girls especially. Paramore just encapsulated a lot of feminine angst and rage that was simmering beneath the surface.  journalist De Elizabeth reflects.  Coming of age in the 2000s was a really unique and challenging time to be a girl. and I feel like Hayley Williams understood that. Her music felt like an olive branch to all of us. or a show of solidarity in some way. barelyAuthor and self-described superfan Alicia Thompson first heard Paramore s  Riot!  on a burned CD with a Sharpie-adorned track list scribbled atop it. She tells HuffPost this was a pivotal moment for her as a fan. so much so that she still has the cherished bootleg album and frequently listens to  Riot!  and other Paramore albums on repeat all these years later. In fact. she credits the band as  very instrumental  in establishing her career as a romance novelist. inspiring her to challenge herself to build characters and stories  around passion and yearning and anger and regret. because their songs are so emotional. Meanwhile. fans like Anna Osinska. who manages Paramore-Music.com. one of the band s oldest fan sites. have transformed their love of  Riot!  into a worldwide connection between fans.  It s been a journey with Paramore. the fan site I run was launched in 2009. Being around the band for like 15 years. growing up with them. being able to interpret the lyrics differently now and then when I was 14 is a gift I haven t had with any other band on such a level. I met so many amazing people thanks to the popularity of ‘Riot!  So many friendships wouldn t have happened.  she says.For many. the Parafamily is just another reason they ve dedicated their time and money to supporting the band.  Paramore has given us one of the most supportive and inviting fandoms that has ever existed and I am so grateful for it each and every day.  Cosmopolitan entertainment editor Tamara Fuentes tells HuffPost.Like many others. Fuentes still listens to Paramore on repeat all these years later. a true testament to the timelessness of the album and band itself. Still. when you find a band during a particularly vulnerable moment in your life. it can make nostalgic feelings bittersweet. ‘Riot!  came out right before a big moment in my life. I was getting heavily bullied at school and it was a very very rough time for me mentally.  Fuentes says.  ‘Riot!  allowed me to be able to channel that anger. pain. and even some of the happiness of the time over the years. ... It s one of the reasons why listening to the album alone can be hard because it brings up some of those memories. but it also shows me how much I ve changed and persevered since then. These are feelings Zach D. Humphrey knows all too well. Although a fan of the band. Zach listens to  Riot!  very occasionally due to the album s power to  jettison  them back to the past.  [It] makes the emotions of back then feel still so real and present. so I m careful about when to revisit those.  they say. Humphrey was raised in a  very far-right Christian environment.  and Paramore was one of the few bands that was considered  safe  to listen to and not considered  blasphemous.   ‘Riot!  was like this beacon that other teenagers were as fed up as I was. I felt very much like ‘a different kind of girl  even when I still identified as male and ‘Riot!  was a great avenue for a lot of those feelings.  they say.  Williams. like me. ended up divorcing herself from a lot of the toxic bits of Christianity that had ended up oppressing her so I ve related as she and Paramore changed things up so much every few years. Almost all fans of the group have one thing in common: They find inspiration in the band s lead singer. For Fuentes and Humphrey. it was discovering their identities when it comes to faith. For Elizabeth. it was Williams  transparency surrounding mental health. For fans like Tiera DiGiorgio and M.K. Lobb. the album was the power to get through the worst parts of adolescence. I got my dad to download [ Riot! ] on my pink iPod nano and it quickly became my favorite.  Lobb recalls of the album that fans have designated as one of the most iconic of all time.  It s still one of the few albums I listen to without skipping a single song.  She remembers blasting songs like  Fences  and  We Are Broken  in the back seat of her parent s car  bemoaning  the fact that her ninth grade crush didn t like her anymore.  ‘Riot!  brings back all the big feelings of being a teen. It accompanied me through so many rough times. but the songs also have the kind of power that made me feel like I could get through it.  she says.For DiGiorgio. who was a freshman in high school when the album came out.  Riot! was a  bright spot in an otherwise dark time.  In fact. the band was so pivotal in her own coming-of-age story that she says she isn t sure where she d be today if she hadn t found it.Paramore was also a way for  outsiders  to unite with others like them.  I was a very lonely kid.  Orlando says.  I was a little punk-goth weirdo at a prep school. but Paramore and similar bands brought me to My People.  They used to attend local shows as a teen and found a safe space away from the  bullying and estrangement  they felt at their high school. To this day. Orlando is still friends with some of the people they met at these shows.  Riot! was a lot of things to me at the time ... but mostly it was a connection with my friends.  Orlando says.  Emo was always about community for me. I felt so at home there. The timelessness of  Riot!  endures all these years later. And. if fans have their way. Paramore s legacy will last long after we re all gone — a classic like The Rolling Stones or The Beatles for future generations to lament teenage woes and understand their own emotions during the early stages of puberty and beyond. As Lobb puts it.  There are bands you grow out of as you get older. but this is not one of them.

Matthew PerryJulia RobertsFriends. Lovers and the Big Terrible ThingThe One After the Superbowl: Part 2in the U.K. s The TimesAs far as the  wooing  was concerned. Perry first sent Roberts  three dozen roses  along with a note that read:  The only thing more exciting than the prospect of you doing the show is that I finally have an excuse to send you flowers. Still. the  Pretty Woman  star wasn t completely sold ― at least not yet.  Her reply was that if I adequately explained quantum physics to her. she d agree to be on the show.  Perry said.  Wow. First of all. I m in an exchange with the woman for whom lipstick was invented. and now I have to hit the books.  So the actor gave himself a crash course. and fulfilled Roberts  request by submitting a lengthy. expeditiously researched  paper all about wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle and entanglement.  And the result?  Not only did Julia agree to do the show. but she also sent me a gift: bagels — lots and lots of bagels.  he said.  Sure. why not? It was Julia fucking Roberts. Roberts was apparently moved by the gesture. and the two actors struck up a friendship that involved a lot of correspondence via fax machine before shooting the episode.

Organic chemistry. An infectious online presence. Music video vixens outfitted in Diesel and Jean Paul Gaultier. FLO has all the makings of a successful girl group. with sultry vocals reminiscent of the early 2000s sound die-hard R&B fans miss. Before their first album had even been released. Renée Downer. Stella Quaresma and Jorja Douglas were on their way to becoming household names.Following their first televised performance on  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  on Oct. 6. the ladies of FLO left New York City and returned to the United Kingdom. The R&B girl group s debut single.  Cardboard Box.  has already reached 10 million streams in six months. Since the release of their EP  The Lead  in September and their latest track  Not My Job.  Downer. Quaresma and Douglas have been working around the clock: performing at the Moth Club London. recording  Later… with Jools Holland.  and more. While the 20-year-old songbirds deserve a celebratory break. they re laser-focused on honing their craft. We ve got a singing lesson.  Douglas told HuffPost. peering into her iPhone s front-facing camera from their Mill Hill-based recording studio.  I can t even remember much of [the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!  performance]. I think. naturally. there were nerves because we knew what we were doing. But it was a really nice environment. We weren t made to feel nervous. Their nerves were assuaged by the countless fans in attendance who knew every lyric of the song. mouthing it alongside them. Written in November 2019.  Cardboard Box  was released in March. amassing 27.000 likes on TikTok. spawning countless duets and stitches on the social media platform. and reproducing a remix that has been used in over 1.1 million videos.  The Lead  has garnered over 25 million streams so far.  There wasn t really a period of time where [ Cardboard Box ] was doing nothing. I think we knew the impact it was going to have. that s why we wanted to release it so bad. The label wanted us to release a different song.  Douglas said.  We wanted to put our best foot forward. and they were able to get on board with that. It was the best decision we could have made because. obviously. it went viral.  Worthy heirs  to Destiny s Child and TLC s legacy. they ve been credited by Pitchfork with  ending the R&B girl group drought.  Apart from their natural chemistry. FLO s seamless arrangements. pitch-perfect harmonies and vocal depth prove that maybe. the genre isn t dead. In fact. Gen Z could revive R&B by studying its earliest pioneers.  We are really shaping our music.  Douglas said.  We re trying to control the narrative. In most of our music. we write and we re very a part of the process — the production. the writing. the melodies and the harmonies. We try to be across all of it to really make sure that FLO is us. which I think is different from the other group I was in. Though FLO s meteoric online rise makes it seem like the trio was an overnight success. the group has been many years in the making. Music has been a constant thread in Quaresma. Downer and Douglas  lives. citing inspiration from  the greats like Beyoncé. Whitney Houston. Mariah Carey. Brandy. Faith Evans.  Quaresma. raised in Mozambique until she was 5 years old. recalls dancing with her cousins and delving into singing upon moving to the U.K. Meanwhile. Downer remembers being a notorious back-seat singer.  [My mum] always listened to the best music. One of my earliest memories is her driving me to school. and she would just play Rihanna and Mary J. Blige.  Downer said.  We would literally pour our hearts out in the car. I feel like my love of music stems from my mom. and she surrounded me with that growing up. Growing up in London. Downer and Quaresma attended secondary school and university together. It would be years before they connected with Douglas in person. In 2017. Douglas won the British talent television show  Got What It Takes.  wowing judges with her soulful rendition of Adele s  When We Were Young  at age 14.  My mum had to put this bunny costume on and hop around on a space hopper to try and win carrots so I could sing in the sing-off.  Douglas laughed. reflecting on her time on the show.  But it was fun. Me and these two [other] girls. we formed a really close relationship. then I was in a girl group with them. But that was short-lived. Trusting her intuition. Douglas felt she wanted to be in a different collective. Douglas. Quaresma and Downer were connected on social media — so they knew of one another — but they developed chemistry at an audition. I think we auditioned [for this talent search] in 2019. It was quite quick from our first audition to us being in a group. maybe a couple of months.  Quaresma said.  Then. we just started making music straight away. Now. the girls are bonded for life with matching  3  tattoos. An inseparable group. their chemistry has won over the hearts of fans. who call themselves  FLO Lifers.  Ironically. Douglas. Quaresma and Downer s synchronicity wasn t the primary source material for the group s name — but Downer said it fits them perfectly. We used to hang out. and there was this random white cat that we just called ‘Flo.  said Downer.  Then. we called ourselves ‘FLO.  but to everybody else. we would just be like. ‘Oh. that s just a placeholder name.  But then we just stuck with it. I feel like we ve given it a meaning. There s three of us. and we re all joined and connected as one. Since FLO s inception in 2019. they ve worked with producers like Grammy-nominated MNEK ( Never Forget You ) and were visited in the studio by former Destiny s Child member Kelly Rowland. With a co-sign from Rowland and British girl group Sugababes. FLO has garnered a roster of celebrity fans. from SZA to Missy Elliott. who see their potential. While the standard set by the Black women entertainers before them is a hard act to follow. the ladies of FLO are not shying away from it. We don t really feel the pressure. Having a co-sign from Kelly Rowland and from other people from that era of music that we love takes the pressure off it a little bit.  said Douglas.  Because we know that we have people in our corner. people rooting for us. that want us to win. So I guess that makes it quite a positive experience. At 20 years old. Douglas. Downer and Quaresma have a strong sense of intuition and confidence in an industry known for whittling young women down. They attribute that strength to their respective upbringings. specifically their mums. and continue to uplift each other. We have all been raised by predominantly single parents. so we know what it s like to be a strong woman. We ve seen it our whole lives.  Downer said.  They really instilled in us a drive to achieve whatever you want to do. Because we re also similar in that way. when you put the three of us together. it s just like —  The people are shook!  exclaimed Douglas. Shooketh!  laughed Downer. Yet these three vocalists remain humble. constantly in awe of their growing support months after  Cardboard Box.  Downer recalled that fans struggled to find the track on Spotify when their latest single.  Not My Job.  was released. But with a cult following on social media. the girls are topping the charts — and  Not My Job  has acquired over 2 million streams. In true Gen Z fashion. Downer. Douglas and Quaresma are constantly online. bonding with their fanbase over their day-to-day antics and gaining new listeners daily. We re in this world now where if you don t do social media. then you re not going to make it as an artist. That s just a fact.  Quaresma said.  But I think we ve grown to like certain spaces like Twitter because we can really interact with everybody. We definitely find the fun out there. As the ladies of FLO continue their journey. they hope to see more people in R&B and elevate the genre. Douglas said that her aspiration for the future of R&B is  to be achieving and making the same impact that pop music has.  But what they all agree upon is that R&B is not dead.  I think people just don t know where to look for it. People just don t want to.  said Douglas.  Or they re scared to admit that it has evolved. Because I guess it s not gonna be the same as it was back in the day. Naturally. everything evolves. I think that s just a hard pill for them to swallow. In addition to releasing more music. Downer said that they re embarking on more live shows and performances. FLO confirmed that an album will be coming in 2023. But first. they ll be releasing singles and crafting  really big moments.  Douglas added. For now. it s back to the studio. We re now trying to work on our sound. We were doing 2000s nostalgia because that s our comfort zone. that s what we ve been influenced by.  Douglas said.  I think now. we need to develop that sound because. obviously. people are just expecting bigger and better things. We just need to really push ourselves to create good music to show people that we re here to stay. ,Entertainment News

K. and told her there was a little bit of egg white mixed with the egg yolk.  McNally said.  M. K. informed the floor manager. G. The kitchen remade the dish but unfortunately sent it with home fries instead of salad.  That s when James Corden began yelling like crazy to the server: ‘You can t do your job! You can t do your job! Maybe I should go into the kitchen and cook the omelette myself!   he wrote.McNally said the server was apologetic and brought the floor manager. G. over to the table.

Harvey Weinstein You don t have any physical evidence to present to this jury that any of this happened. do you?  lawyer Alan Jackson asked pointedly during cross-examination.the 70-year-old Weinstein s Los Angeles trial Any photos?  No.  the woman said quietly. Any video?  No.  she replied. then added.  Do you think somebody after rape makes a video? She began crying softly as she answered  no  to a series of similar questions about whether she had any documentation of bruises. scrapes. cuts. or handprints on her face from Weinstein holding her down. or had been given a sexual assault examination. Do you have any physical evidence that you were even with Mr. Weinstein?  Jackson asked.Her crying grew louder as she answered.  I had his jacket. but I gave it away. the first of Weinstein s accusers to testifyProsecutors have presented photographs and other evidence that both Weinstein and the woman were at the Los Angeles Italia Film Festival. which she had come to California to attend in February 2013.But they have not yet produced anything that puts Weinstein at her hotel on the night she says he forced her to perform oral sex on her bed then raped her in her bathroom.The woman did not go to police until October of 2017. when women s stories about Weinstein made him the central figure in the #MeToo movement.She maintains that Weinstein left her jacket in the room and she gave it to hotel staff. but no lost-and-found records have been discovered to demonstrate it.Asked whether the explosion of media stories around Weinstein prompted her to go to police. the woman repeated earlier testimony that she had already decided to file a report earlier in the year when she urged her teenage daughter to go to authorities over sexual harassment she d been subjected to at school.The woman is going only by  Jane Doe 1  in court. Her age and birthplace have also been kept out of court proceedings. though she has said her first language was Russian and she was living at the time with her three children in Italy. where she had married into considerable wealth.The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly. Weinstein s defense tried to poke holes in her testimony and press on inconsistencies in previous accounts she gave to police. to prosecutors. to a grand jury. and in the first two days of her trial testimony.In graphic questioning. Jackson dwelt on the woman s description in her initial interview with police of oral sex she said Weinstein forced her to perform. Jackson suggested that Weinstein s unusual genital features after a surgery he had years earlier made the acts she described impossible.The same acts went unmentioned during her 2020 grand jury testimony. and Jackson asked her whether she had learned more about Weinstein s sex organs from prosecutors and thus changed her story. Never!  she said adamantly.Under questioning later from the prosecution. she described  very bad scarring tissue  around Weinstein s genitals.sentenced to 23 years in prisonThe woman told prosecutor Paul Thompson that she had been having panic attacks and had hardly slept or eaten since her testimony began Monday afternoon. It finally ended late Wednesday.Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of rape and sexual assault involving five women.When prosecutors gave their opening statement Monday. however. they excluded one of the women. putting into question whether the four counts involving her will be addressed during the trial.The district attorney s office has declined to explain when asked about the issue.Weinstein s attorneys said no charges have been dropped.,Entertainment News
James Cameron thinks the characters in Marvel and DC films are missing something crucial.In a new interview with The New York Times. the  Avatar: The Way of Water  director dissed Marvel and DC superheroes for lacking emotional depth during a conversation with cast stars Sam Worthington. Zoë Saldaña and Sigourney Weaver about the upcoming sequel to 2009 s  Avatar. Speaking on the film s titular characters. Jake Sully (Cameron) and Neytiri (Saldaña). Cameron discussed the  suicidal leap of faith  they take in the movie and pointed to their character development. which then prompted him to voice his displeasure with the immaturity of characters in the long-running DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchises.  When I look at these big. spectacular films — I m looking at you. Marvel and DC — it doesn t matter how old the characters are. they all act like they re in college.  Cameron said in the interview. taking a dig at his Blockbuster rivals Marvelhighest-grossing film of all time They have relationships. but they really don t.  the three-time Oscar winner said of characters seen in both Marvel and DC Comics projects.  They never hang up their spurs because of their kids. The things that really ground us and give us power. love. and a purpose? Those characters don t experience it. and I think that s not the way to make movies.  Set 15 years after the events of the first  Avatar  film. the sequel follows Sully and Neytiri. and the family they ve started. The epic science fiction film centers around the  trouble that follows them. the lengths they go to keep each other safe. the battles they fight to stay alive. and the tragedies they endure.  according to the film s official websiteCameron. who has directed multiple critically-acclaimed projects. including  The Terminator.   Aliens  and  Titanic.  isn t the only director who has expressed a similar aversion to superhero-centered flicks. Over the years. Martin Scorsese. Ridley Scott and Francis Ford Coppola have also condemned the blockbuster heavy-hitters. Nonetheless. Cameron praised Marvel Studios in May 2019 after  Avengers: Endgame  surpassed his 1997  Titanic  film to become the second highest-grossing film of all time. To Kevin and everyone at Marvel. An iceberg sank the real Titanic.  the 68-year-old wrote at the time.  It took the Avengers to sink my Titanic. Everyone here at Lightstorm Entertainment salutes your amazing achievement.

I was able to meet with Jerry Bruckheimer. who apologized that I had that experience cause he really wants everyone to have a good experience on his projects.  That really moved me — the fact that he remembered that I had mentioned that.  she said.  and that he felt compelled to bring it up and to take accountability.  The Hollywood Reporter I m not talking about the cast. The cast was great.  she said.  I m talking about the political stuff that went on behind closed doors. It was a lot of above-the-line versus below-the-line. extras versus actors. producers versus PAs.  The actor said that  it was very elitist.  to the point that she  almost quit the business.

Hugh Jackman is looking back on the steamy moment he once shared with Matt Damon on a Broadway stage. In a Variety cover story published Wednesday. Jackman — who currently stars in  The Music Man  — shared the juicy details about his first Broadway stage role in  The Boy From Oz.  which opened nearly 20 years ago in October 2003. according to Playbill.Jackman told the outlet.  the most fun I ever had was playing Peter Allen  due to all the improv moments in the show where he initiated interactions with the audience.  There was. I don t know. roughly 10 to 12 minutes of every show that was ad-libbed.  the 54-year-old said.  Once I was 50 or 60 shows in. I felt completely free to do whatever the hell I wanted. I was an a**hole at times. During one wild moment. he lured Matt Damon into his onstage shenanigans.  I brought up Barbara Walters and Matt Damon. and made Matt Damon give Barbara Walters a lap dance. which turned into me giving Matt Damon a lap dance.  Jackman recalled.  And he didn t punch me. Amid another impromptu moment. Jackman told Variety he also surprised Sarah Jessica Parker by bringing her onstage during the 2004 Tony Awards. which almost led to a wardrobe malfunction.  I really felt for her that night.  he said.  As soon as she got up onstage. I could tell those boobs were about to come out. Last month. it was announced that Jackman would reprise his role as Wolverine in the upcoming  Deadpool 3  film.Jackman allegedly retired the Wolverine role with 2017 s  Logan.  the final film in the Wolverine trilogy. after playing the no-nonsense character several times throughout the X-Men franchise.

Michael Imperioli is thinking back on his unforgettable first day on the set of  The Sopranos. PeopleWho s Talking to Chris Wallace?James Gandolfini  The first day of work. I had to drive him. I didn t have a driver s license. you know. but I didn t tell anybody that because I wanted the job. Because Christopher s job was to drive Tony.  Imperioli revealed to host Wallace.  But Michael didn t know how to drive. But I m like. well. how hard could it be? That s when the day took an unexpected turn.  I had to drive backwards down the sidewalk with trees on both sides and extras running out of the way. Delivering dialogue to Tony Soprano. Looking forward. I mean. that s hard to do.  he shared.  Even if you know how to drive. which I do now. I did it. like. four times. The fifth time — boom. right into the tree. The airbags go off. Jim s head snaps back.  It s my first day I met the guy. There s smoke. people are running.  Imperioli added.  And I m like. ‘They re gonna fire me. man. this is really bad.  Nonetheless. Gandolfini had a hilariously unforeseen reaction to the catastrophic mishap.  I look over and he s laughing hysterically.  the  Goodfellas  actor recalled.Gandolfini starred as the series  lead and antihero protagonist. Tony Soprano. who was also Moltisanti s mentor and  uncle  in the critically acclaimed crime drama. The beloved actor died of a heart attack in June 2013 at age 51. Elsewhere in the interview. Imperioli opened up about the controversial ending of  The Sopranos  in 2007. which has long been hailed as one of the greatest TV endings of all time. In the final scene. Tony is seen eating with his family at Holsten s diner in the wake of a turf war between the New Jersey and New York Mafia families. As Journey s  Don t Stop Believing  plays on the jukebox. his daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) arrives at the restaurant. However. as the entrance door opens with a bell ringing. the screen turns to Tony. and then cuts to black before the credits roll in silence. I ve gone back and forth. And then I thought maybe it s just what you see is what you get.  Imperioli explained.  That s the end of the story. There s no dying. there s no what if. there s no what happened to Tony. it s just ends right there. I don t know. He added.  It s mysterious. People ask me that all the time. Last year. the show s creator David Chase finally cleared the air about the mob boss s fate. telling The Hollywood Reporterthat the final product deviated from his original plan to have Tony  coming from New Jersey back into New York for a meeting at which he was going to be killed.

James Cameron thinks the characters in Marvel and DC films are missing something crucial.In a new interview with The New York Times. the  Avatar: The Way of Water  director dissed Marvel and DC superheroes for lacking emotional depth during a conversation with cast stars Sam Worthington.

Cameron discussed the  suicidal leap of faith  they take in the movie and pointed to their character development. which then prompted him to voice his displeasure with the immaturity of characters in the long-running DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchises.

Hugh Jackman is looking back on the steamy moment he once shared with Matt Damon on a Broadway stage. In a Variety cover story published Wednesday. Jackman — who currently stars in  The Music Man  — shared the juicy details about his first Broadway stage role in  The Boy From Oz.  which opened nearly 20 years ago in October 2003. according to Playbill.Jackman told the outlet.  the most fun I ever had was playing Peter Allen  due to all the improv moments in the show where he initiated interactions with the audience.  There was. I don t know. roughly 10 to 12 minutes of every show that was ad-libbed.  the 54-year-old said.  Once I was 50 or 60 shows in. I felt completely free to do whatever the hell I wanted. I was an a**hole at times. During one wild moment. he lured Matt Damon into his onstage shenanigans.  I brought up Barbara Walters and Matt Damon. and made Matt Damon give Barbara Walters a lap dance. which turned into me giving Matt Damon a lap dance.  Jackman recalled.  And he didn t punch me. Amid another impromptu moment. Jackman told Variety he also surprised Sarah Jessica Parker by bringing her onstage during the 2004 Tony Awards. which almost led to a wardrobe malfunction.

Around the time when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. someone on Twitter posted something to the effect that we can no longer tiptoe around the facts in front of us:  Everything is political now.  This thought. which turned out to be pervasively true. again sprang to mind after watching  Holy Spider.  the taut new film noir loosely inspired by the case of Saeed Hanaei. the serial killer who murdered 16 female sex workers in Mashhad. Iran. between 2000 and 2001. That s because it raises a number of questions many are asking right now. For example. is a true crime-adjacent drama like this one — or other recent ones such as  Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story  or  BlacKkKlansman  — beholden to certain facts or even a political agenda in its storytelling?Transparently.  Holy Spider  does take some liberties with the truth. as its filmmaker Ali Abbasi. an Iranian exile based in Copenhagen. candidly admitted. But with consideration and effectively. especially when you think about it outside the more rigid expectations of true crime dramas. The film follows fictionalized journalist Rahimi (Zar Amir-Ebrahimi) who enters Iran s holy city of Mashhad from Tehran to investigate the murders. The first few scenes of the film crystallize what it s actually about when she is expected to negotiate how much of her hair she exposes underneath her hijab in order to gain entry to a hotel room that was confirmed before her arrival. Rahimi doesn t concede and. with obvious annoyance. is granted her room key. She s a female journalist in a place where she is expected to submit to her male counterparts. including the local police who had all but resolved that maybe these women s deaths were  God s will  by the time Rahimi gets there. strict religious codeMahsa Amini s deathIt also points to what Abbasi considers one of the most important themes in the movie: the misogyny embedded in Iran s culture that enables and even emboldens someone like the so-called  spider killer.  That s one reason why. the writer-director says. the film doesn t abide by the typical serial-killer-at-large crime drama style. I think one important narrative decision was to not to make a movie about another serial killer. but make a movie about a serial killer society.  Abbasi told HuffPost on a video call.  That informed the other decisions in terms of. ‘OK. one of the most important themes here is misogyny.  a documentary There is something with this reality that I think is really important.  he said.  And that s where it gets really tricky. Because on one hand. I didn t want to make a documentary. But on the other hand. I wanted to have a certain respect for the complexity of the reality at least.  There s also a difference between a film s responsibility to reality. which  Holy Spider  arguably upholds. versus adhering to each element of it. Because it would be easy to make a movie about how all the Iranian officials are corrupt.  Abbasi continued.  And I think that while it s a film noir. it s not about showing you a nuanced image of Iran. I m not a spokesperson for anyone. This is my subjective view of things.  Subjective. but also reflective of real-life Iran where many people play particular roles within the system.  I think it was important to have this panoramic view of society and say. ‘OK. if this guy did that. there s a context. If people supported him. there s a context. If the journalists. they re doing the investigation and it seems like a cop-cut universe. there s a context.  Doing that meant expanding the story. He changed Hanaei s last name in the film and fictionalized some facts about the real-life female journalist who tracked the case to draw attention away from the actual people and to his overall theme.Still. Abbasi is well-aware of the ongoing debate around how much of the facts a filmmaker refers to versus how much is fictionalized. and he seems ready for the conversation.  There are different ways of looking [at it].  the filmmaker said.  For me. I have a filmmaker brain. But I also have a more. let s say. theoretical brain. And the theoretical part of me is this hard line between what is reality. what is not. it s really not accurate.  Because there s an often binary discussion of it as it pertains to filmmakers  approach.  I think this is really important: This movie is not all this true crime stuff. I think it s important to say it has inspiration from reality. but it s not the recounting of that person s life.  Most notably. Abbasi and his team — including co-writer Afshin Kamran Bahrami — portray Rahimi going undercover as a sex worker to try to catch the killer in the act. The journalist doesn t do this in reality. While the real-life journalist does subsequently attend Hanaei s trials. as Rahimi does in the film. the events that occur once the character goes undercover are actually things that happen to a victim that ran away from Hanaei. She helped bring him to justice. That s. I think. the biggest fictionalization decision we made. to take some distance from the facts of the actual case.  Abbasi said.  Because this movie [is] about misogyny. I think it was important that these dots are connected.  For the director. that meant also showing the audience the minutiae of misogyny. Like the early scene with Rahimi trying to get the key to her room. Or even when she narrowly escapes the killer after he picks her up on the street. In his home. where he conducts the murders. she removes her head scarf. dons red lipstick and even lights a cigarette.exactly  It s the same character.  Abbasi explained.  even if in reality they would be different. It felt like. ‘OK. if you feel the character of the woman being mistreated.  I felt that was something that was beneficial for what I want to tell.  We don t get much of Rahimi s interiority. save for a brief scene where she s painting her nails in her room and receives a call from her mother. But we still recognize her not merely as a symbol but as an identifiable person who comes to Mashhad with a professional reputation that s been sullied by misogyny. Like the killer s victims. themselves performing work met with persecution. Rahimi is not a simple protagonist. That was crucial for Abbasi.  I think the really important thing was — and this is something we really struggled with — not to make her a hero. Not to make her the bearer of the truth. and a perfect person. and a victim of the system. All that is true. but I think she s also a human being. The same can be said about the killer in the film. a character with which some audiences might struggle. Because Saeed. eerily portrayed by Mehdi Bajestani when many Iranian actors didn t even want to touch this material. is both the family man that he was in real life as well as the cold-blooded murderer he also was. prowling the streets at night for his next victim. It s a difficult dichotomy to witness. but also disturbingly realistic.  From the beginning. what I thought the really mysterious thing about this whole case was not that there was this guy who was walking around in the shadows. and being a brilliant. twisted mind.  Abbasi explained. It was important for the filmmaker that Saeed didn t come off as  a crazy guy.  But rather someone who could have really been any other man in Mashhad at the time. sharing intimate revelations with friends. eating dinner at home. But obviously. also with a dark side shrouded in the idea that he is performing Allah s work. The whole thing was him being very normal. and having three kids and being a good father and all that. For me. that was a real fascination. actually. I wasn t as fascinated as how he killed people. because I think that s a pretty straightforward procedure in a way. And Abbasi spares no details in the murder scenes. Saeed lures each woman to his place and. once her back is turned. strangles her with her own head scarf. In keeping with his panoramic storytelling.  Holy Spider  spends some time reflecting on the aftermath of a victim s death with her family — some of the women were mothers and each was someone s daughter — and the complicated responses to the way she lived her life. There s sincere grief. anguish and bewilderment that surrounds the women s murders just as there is for Saeed s conviction in the film. That s not to say these two things are conflated in the story. Far from it. actually. But there s an honest and necessary reflection of the complex human impact and the way some people make concessions for a killer and his victims  deaths in the name of a religious order.A lot of it also comes down to understanding the ways in which women are compelled to live in this society. Particularly in the scene where Saeed and his wife have sex on the floor of their home or the scenes with the sex workers. Abbasi wanted to take a closer look at how these women move in this world. And that called for finding actors who felt comfortable to perform it. He d even go as far to give the film a  political mission.  as he put it.  to break the representation of women in Iranian cinema — that representation in the world. really.   Because for 40-plus years. I think the Iranian government has mounted probably the most successful censorship operation ever in the history of the world.  he continued.  where they actually got people to believe that women in Iran sleep with their headscarves on.  Clearly this is a cause about which Abbasi feels passionately.  And they don t never move. they never eat. they never fart.  he went on.  Like. they don t have a body. don t touch anyone. have no sexuality. and no physics. We wanted to make that very concrete and very clear that they have bodies. So there was a context to that. It makes the women s deaths even more difficult to watch on the big screen. That is particularly true right now when Amini s death and the reignited conversation around the morality police in Iran have sparked protests across the country. While Abbasi realizes that once a film enters the world. it takes on a new life of its own and is recontextualized based on whatever is going on in the current moment. he finds the pressure to speak on it a challenge. I think it has sort of put me in a tricky situation because I really don t want to serve [this way].  he said.  I m really. really happy if anyone watches the movie and gets informed about Iranian affairs. I think it s a win for me. already. There s another side to this. though.  But then as a filmmaker. I really feel strange about being too much drawn into this conversation about. Is this real?How much of it is real?Is this [a] political thing? Because. now I have the hat of a political activist. and now I have the hat of the film director. and they re really different. These days. Abbasi constantly finds himself walking this line. Including on the day of this interview. he continues to reckon with that.  There comes a moment when no matter how much you say you don t want to get involved in politics. which I ve said for a long time. if you don t show some sensitivities to what s going on around you…  Abbasi began. He slightly interrupted himself to point to a real-life instance that entered his mind just as he was grappling with this.   ... And at this time when a 16-year-old is killed — and there s a smashed skull. they steal her body from the parent. and then they shoot at the relatives who want to come and mourn. and threaten the mother to come on TV and say that her kid was mentally ill.  Abbasi reaches his conclusion:  And when somebody asks that question over so many of those limits. I think my preference is about how to deal with them and how it doesn t matter anymore. So. if I can use my shoe to push this on. I do. If I can use my movie. I will. If I can use my fingers. I would. ,Entertainment News

Will  Mr. Schue performed the  Thong Song GleeYes. the first script of the Ryan Murphy-created musical juggernaut. which ultimately ran for six seasons on Fox and picked up multiple Emmys. featured a very different origin story for the glee club director played by Matthew Morrison.And That s What You REALLY Missed It was sort of like ‘Election.  but like the NC-17 version of show choir with a weird protagonist who was unraveling.  he added.Murphy also said that the first draft of the pilot. written by co-creator Ian Brennan. featured the teacher inappropriately  touching  his students.The script made its way to Murphy s hands after FX chose not to pick up his series  Pretty/Handsome.  leaving him feeling defeated and without a project. Like serendipity. I went to the gym and I was in a towel and a guy came up and handed me a script.  Murphy recalled.  He said. ‘I have a feeling you were in show choir. am I right?  And I was like. ‘Yeah.   And he said. ‘My friend wrote this script and you should read it.   Murphy said.  And he gave it to me. But the darker elements of the project didn t exactly appeal to Murphy. who wanted to work on a show that was  very poppy and primary colors  after helming the twisted plastic surgery drama  Nip/Tuck  for years. So. after months of rewriting and pitching to the network.  Glee  was given a 13-episode order. and the rest is history.As for casting the show. before Morrison eventually came aboard. Murphy revealed that he was eyeing a certain pop star to play the role.  When we were writing the pilot ― I ve never really talked about this ― that pilot was written for Justin Timberlake.  he said.  Mr. Schue was written for Justin.  Glee  would go on to welcome a number of A-listers throughout its run. including everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow and Britney Spears to Olivia Newton-John and Whoopi Goldberg.

The most interesting parts of the first season of  The White Lotus  were the stories being told around the show s edges. The intrigue came not from the stories about the rich and mostly white guests having a miserable week at a Hawaiian resort called the White Lotus. but from the ones about the long-suffering White Lotus employees and a cautionary tale about colonialism and exploitation.Yet for the most part. they were only gestured at. never fully developed. For me. that made the show an emptier version of what could have been a much stronger installment in the  eat the rich  genreSeason 2 of Mike White s anthology series. which begins Sunday on HBO — the premier destination for  eat the rich  shows — follows a similar structure to the first season. While it began as a limited series. it s easy to see why this became an anthology series. The first episode of the new season once again opens with the discovery of a dead body at a White Lotus resort (actually. multiple dead bodies). this time in Sicily. It then flashes back. chronologically tracking the tales of a new group of rich and mostly white vacationers. once again having a miserable week.This time. there s a bit more complexity and texture to the show. thanks in large part to a richer tapestry of characters. There are more characters who are on the outside looking in. so we re not gazing as emptily as we were in the first season. In addition. the new season gradually starts to build out various segments of a story about toxic masculinity and gender politics. suggesting it might have more to say than it did before.The Season 1 guests often felt like they fell into predictable categories and types: insufferable people dealing with largely petty problems. Now. several of the new characters are on the periphery of the show s insular world. making it more intriguing to view the show through their lens. Among the best performances in the Aperol Spritz-filled new season is Aubrey Plaza as Harper. who has begrudgingly accompanied her husband Ethan (Will Sharpe) on a couples trip with Ethan s college roommate Cameron (Theo James) and his wife Daphne (Meghann Fahy). Harper is not sure why Ethan and Cameron are friends: Cameron is more of a bro. in contrast to the more reserved Ethan. Harper and Ethan both come from more economically modest backgrounds. and therefore Harper views the wealthy Cameron and Daphne as entitled. vapid and fake. Ethan. who has recently become rich from selling his startup. agrees to some extent. but hangs out with them anyway. They don t read. It s like. what do they even talk about? Is that what happens when you re rich for too long? Your brain just atrophies?  Harper asks him after the first day of the trip. when in conversation. they discover Cameron and Daphne don t read the news and probably didn t vote. It s good to have. you know. diverse friends. I guess.  Ethan says.But as Harper points out. she and Ethan. as the two mixed-race people in the group (something that perhaps could have been developed more). are Cameron and Daphne s  white-passing diverse friends. At first. Harper has no interest in being part of the group. bringing a book to meals and trying to avoid sitting with Cameron and Daphne at the hotel s breakfast buffet while Ethan goes on a morning run. Gradually. she plays along. turning her feigned enthusiasm into a game for her own amusement. In private. she mocks the couple and eventually uncovers some holes in their idyllic facade. Harper s derision toward her travel companions and the trip. while also participating in it. mirrors our own viewing experience. We pooh-pooh the petty problems of the characters. But we can t help but want to gaze at them.The show s gaze is much more interesting when it s directed at characters like Harper. who are on the outside looking in. Another one of those characters is the beleaguered resort manager Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore). the Season 2 version of Armond (Murray Bartlett). who berates the staff for not keeping everything in tiptop shape. She is also unsuccessfully trying to keep local sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco) and her friend. aspiring musician Mia (Beatrice Grannò). off the premises and away from the guests. However. as later episodes suggest. there s more to Valentina than we think. and it ll be interesting to see if we get more of her inner life and motivations as the season progresses.Returning from Season 1 is Emmy winner Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya. who is once again a lonely soul searching for emotional connection at another White Lotus resort. But it s her assistant Portia (Haley Lu Richardson) who has the more interesting storyline. Tanya abandons Portia. leaving her to her own devices and allowing her to get a taste of a life that does not involve tending to her boss s every need.Portia strikes up a potential romance with Albie (Adam DiMarco). Albie is staying at the White Lotus with his philandering father Dom (Michael Imperioli) and grandfather Bert (F. Murray Abraham). on a family vacation to pay homage to their Sicilian roots. While many of the characters  storylines circle around gender politics and toxic masculinity. those themes start to coalesce in the season s third episode. when Albie. Dom and Bert go on a tour of various locations where  The Godfather  was filmed. I m curious to see whether these themes become more concrete. and how they figure into the potentially murderous conclusion.Similar to the first season. there are times when I wish the show had something sharper and more lacerating to say about these characters. even when it s implied. The episodes are punctuated with ominous shots of waves lapping the shore. Like the sea. the show can glimmer while at times also revealing an emptiness underneath.But still. there s something tantalizing about the way  The White Lotus.  as well as many of the other  eat the rich  shows. implicates the viewer. In my case. despite my continued ambivalence about the series. I flew through the first five episodes provided to critics. All that glitters is not gold. But we can t help but gawk — and once we do. we can t look away.The second season of  The White Lotus  premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and HBO Max.,Entertainment News

With the pandemic increasing Hollywood production costs and an economic recession incoming. many of the biggest entertainment companies. including Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix. have started to make drastic and alarming cuts to programming and staff.As a new report out Thursday warns. Hollywood executives must not fall into their old pattern of letting diversity and inclusion efforts fall by the wayside in times of tightening budgets. With a looming recession. the industry is faced with continued uncertainty. which historically does not bode well for diversity when it is treated as optional instead of essential.  the team behind the annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report wrote.  Diversity initiatives traditionally are the first to be cut or sacrificed when there are economic downturns. This is already evident with the recent sale of The CW and the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery. Many executives of color or executives who supported diverse programming were let go from their positions at these companies. and diverse shows have been either canceled. shelved. or dropped from development. Founded by UCLA executive vice chancellor and provost Dr. Darnell Hunt and Dr. Ana-Christina Ramón. director of the school s Entertainment and Media Research Initiative. the report has consistently illustrated that TV shows and movies with more equitable racial and gender representation perform better with audiences.Thursday s new report on diversity in TV draws particular attention to the fact that despite gradual representation gains over the last few years. opportunities in Hollywood ― especially those behind the camera ― are still inequitably distributed. In an era of big-budget streaming and premium cable shows like Amazon s  The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power  and HBO s  Game of Thrones  prequel  House of the Dragon.  the report found that women and people of color are far less likely to get the chance to create these kinds of spectacle shows. compared to their white male counterparts. We saw an uptick in opportunity for people of color and women having their shows greenlit. which should be a marker of progress.  Ramón said in the report.  However. when we examined the episodic budgets of all the TV series. we see a strong pattern indicating that shows created by people of color and women tended to receive smaller budgets than those created by white men. particularly in the digital arena.  The higher the show s budget. the more likely it was created by a white man. For example. on digital and streaming shows. where creators tend to get bigger budgets and more creative freedom. 66.6% of creators of color and 51.4% of white female creators had budgets under $3 million per episode in the 2020-21 season. according to the report. By contrast. only 38.8% of white male creators on streaming shows were given a budget of under $3 million per episode. (For comparison. production on the eight-episode first season of  The Rings of Power  reportedly cost $465 million. which breaks down to $58.1 million per episode. making it the most expensive TV show ever made thus far.  House of the Dragon  had a budget of about $20 million per episode. Both were created by white men. and  The Rings of Power  was developed by two first-time showrunners.)The report looked at the race and gender of the actors. writers. directors and creators on 407 scripted broadcast. cable. and digital or streaming shows that aired in the 2020-21 season. Over the last few years. people of color have gotten close to reaching proportionate representation on screen. according to the report. But they continue to remain underrepresented behind the camera. For example. only 13.1% of creators on broadcast shows were people of color. 25.6% on streaming shows and 26.6% on cable shows. On screen. representation of Latinx. Asian. Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) and Native lead actors is still lacking. the report found. Across the board. Latinx underrepresentation remains the most disproportionate of any of the racial and ethnic groups studied in the report — a disappointing. but sadly unsurprising. pattern in Hollywood.Consistent with the team s findings in prior years. shows with more diverse casts tended to have higher viewership and more social media engagement. It proves once again that audiences want diversity on screen. and therefore. diversity is not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity for Hollywood s survival.But as the researchers warn. progress in Hollywood has often ebbed and flowed. and if the recent wave of economic cuts continues. we could see the hard-won gains made in recent years start to wane. The next few years may be a true test of whether Hollywood is truly committed to the changes they promised on the diversity front during the nation s reckoning on race following the George Floyd murder.  the researchers wrote in the report.  Rolling back these efforts before equity for people of color and women has been truly achieved would be a major miscalculation by Hollywood. Any cost-savings they realize now at the expense of alienating increasingly diverse viewers who expect increased representation in their TV shows. do not make good business sense in the long term.

And the reason that s so important is because we expect the same thing from citizens in terms of policy decisions.  he added.  Part of what it means to live in a democracy is that we have this process for getting decisions that all of us have to live by ― those of us who agreed with the decision and those of us who were against it.  And so if we all have to live with the outcome of each of these policy choices. it s only fair that the people who make them have to live with the outcome of when we choose which one of them is going to be in charge.

HuffPost spotlights stylists and costume designers who have delivered some of our favorite celebrities  or characters  most memorable looks. Read my interview with  Atlanta  costume designer and stylist Tiffany Hasbourne. School Daze.   Do The Right Thing.   B.A.P.S.   Black Panther.  Behind these generation-defining films is one Academy Award-winning costume designer: Ruth E. Carter. With over 35 years of experience in the television. stage and film industries. Carter s resume precedes her. From  Malcolm X  to  Selma.   Coming 2 America.  and more. she has over 60 film credits to her name. In February 2019. Carter made history as the first Black American to win the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. Later that year. in September. she appeared in her own episode of the Netflix documentary  Abstract.  a series highlighting artists in the design field.In 2021. Carter debuted her first fashion line. called  Ruthless.  and was honored with her own museum exhibition. titled  Ruth E. Carter: Afrofuturism in Costume Design.  at the Savannah College of Art & Design s FASH Museum in Atlanta. But before Carter was walking down red carpets. she roamed the halls of Hampton University as a special education major.  I would audition for plays. and one day. I didn t make the audition for a play.  she recalled.  The director asked me if I wanted to do the costumes. because I had a history of sewing on my own and creating stuff at home. I thought. ‘Maybe that s something I could do.  He gave me the key to the costume shop on campus. nobody had been utilizing it. so it became my playground. Soon. Carter became known for her wearable art. designing for plays. step shows and dance companies on the yard. Shortly after that. she met filmmaker Spike Lee in Los Angeles. and they launched their careers together. The throughline in her work. she says. is  to tell authentic stories about the Black race.  and. in meeting with  Black Panther  director Ryan Coogler. she found that their missions aligned. Much of our story is laced within our past and what we have gone through. I m not trying to make up the future. I m using the facts to paint a picture of the future.  Carter said.  If that means I feel that we are destined for greatness. then I can use those stories of greatness today to tell a story about the life of a person in the future or in the present. For this edition of  Who s Behind the Clothes.  Carter talked to HuffPost about the design process for  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.  discussed the next chapter of her 35-year career. and explained what Afrofuturism in storytelling and costuming means to her.Do you remember what it was like first learning about  Black Panther  and what intrigued you about it?I was asked to interview back in 2016 for the first one. When you hear  Black Panther.  you can go in either direction: Black Panther Party or you can think  Black Panther.  I wasn t sure. but they did send me a couple of comic strips. they re very closed-grip on story because they don t want these things to get out. When I was first told about it. I didn t really know what story we were telling. However. I could look at the comics and tell that we were doing a story about the Black Panther who lived in Wakanda. I started putting images of Afrofuture together to bring to my meeting. so it wasn t until I got into the meeting that I met Ryan Coogler and [producer] Nate Moore. We found that there was a similar aesthetic that we shared with the images that I brought. he had some of the same images on the wall in his office. which was inspiring to me.Within the African diaspora. we think of Kwanzaa. we think of Kiswahili. we think of  the revolution will not be televised.  We grew up understanding that. Ryan being from Oakland. California. and me coming through Spike Lee s vision. His philosophy was similar. we wanted to uplift the race. we wanted to do project images of Afrofuture. For us then. [it] was considered more neo-soul or just having more positive images of people that we knew. as opposed to every time we were seeing someone Black on camera. they were not representing our community and our neighborhood. They were gangbangers or something like that. That was in the forefront of cinema. and we wanted to change that.When I met Ryan Coogler at Marvel and Nate Moore. they had seen  Malcolm X  and they liked what I had done in those films.  Black Panther  was a similar approach in that we were going to build a world of Afrofuture together. one that was not looking at Africa as one monolithic place. but also all of the beauty of being influenced by tribes as well as moving it into a technological sphere of Marvel. Afrofuture is the combination of that. the culture woven into technology. There was a meeting of the minds in that respect.What does Afrofuturism mean to you. and what do you think is your responsibility as a costume designer to advance Afrofuturism through storytelling?My personal desire is to make sure that I tell authentic stories about the Black race. about the African American story. Much of our story is laced within our past and what we have gone through. I m not trying to make up the future. I m just trying to paint a picture as a storyteller that s based on facts. If that makes me kind of a futurist. then the facts of our present will lead us into a future that could be very bright. I m using the facts to paint a picture of the future. If that means I feel that we are destined for greatness. then I can use those stories of greatness today to tell a story about the life of a person in the future or in the present. We are just now embarking on things. like it being OK to wear braids to work and what understanding diversity really means on both sides of the coin. I take that on as part of my responsibility. not only in storytelling for film. but in my own work in my workplace. I try to walk the walk and talk the talk.Before you begin a project. what is your preparation process? How much research goes into costume designing for a movie such as  Do The Right Thing  versus  Black Panther ?A lot. With  Black Panther.  we researched the tribes.  Do The Right Thing  was contemporary at the time. it s a protest film. We wanted to show that it was the hottest day of the summer. We wanted to saturate the colors and make it very stylized. different than what you might see if you were just to walk down the streets of Bed-Stuy. You might see a little more of a grayer palette. and [with] ours. we didn t have much money. It was an independent film. so we had to rely on Nike to give us stuff. Nike gave us a lot of compression shorts. tank tops. and shoes — and all of that was very bright. The research that we had to do to balance out the saturated tones from the sportswear was to put African prints together with it. We made a lot of summer tops and shorts out of African prints. then we put compression shorts from Nike underneath it. or bright tank tops with African shorts to stylize our film. Black Panther  is more futuristic. It s contemporary and futuristic. based on the inspiration of the different regions and tribes of Africa. You have the Himba tribe. which uses this red clay on their skin and in their hair. so we use that color when we are creating the Dora Milaje.There are illustration teams. There are development teams at Marvel. There s a process not only with Marvel but with  Malcolm X.  There is a process of research and development and being inspired by something that you see and implementing that into a costume. There are prototypes that are done. that are examined by teams. but ultimately the final decision on texture. color. shape. approach. and teams falls on me. That means that the hundreds of costumes that are designed on any project. even if it does come from an inspiration from a magazine or an original drawing. I have to work with the director and capture the storytelling with the design. It s not like we can just take anything. we have to make sure that everything immerses into the story that the director is leading us through. You can t have too many people asking too many questions of the director. It s filtered through one person — the filmmakers. DP. the production designer. and myself — then we all have our teams that we work together with. with keys that lead those teams. There definitely is a family tree. if you would. that develops ideas. presents them. has them manufactured and fit onto actors. What can you tell us about how the styling. designing and aesthetic of the costumes in  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever  differs from the first film? With the passing of Chadwick [Boseman]. what role does the costume design play in depicting a community navigating loss?I can t really tell you much about how they differ. but I do know that we have done a lot of things that are new — and we ve gotten a lot of things in there that are the same. Just like you would see a Batman suit in a new  Batman  movie. it s not the same suit from the last movie. It s a new suit. We approached  Wakanda Forever  with that in mind. We were going to keep a lot of the aesthetic of Wakanda. we re not trying to reinvent something that already worked. But regarding our super suits. the Dora. and all those uniforms that we had in the first one. we wanted to do an upgraded look. You see Lord M Baku s wooden armor is a lot different. and there s a story behind it. The Dora Milaje have different aspects of their armor that s very different. and there s a story behind that. You see Queen Ramonda in more beautiful. sculpted pieces. and there s a story behind that. The upgrade is what we hoped to stun our audience with.Losing Chad was a shock. and we proceeded with building a world that we felt honored his presence if he were there. We were doing that already. so honestly. nothing was changing with the costumes. We just had to craft another storyline. which is what Ryan Coogler and [co-writer] Joe Robert Cole did. but it was very difficult. As far as the aesthetics and costumes go. we were always trying to make it a very beautiful and interesting and layered Wakanda. The costumes honor him as if the Black Panther lives.You ve been at the forefront of so many generation-defining movies. creating images and clothes that are imprinted in our minds forever. What does that impact mean to you?Well. I came into this wanting to be a really good costume designer and I pursued that dream. In my pursuit of becoming a really good costume designer. I grabbed every opportunity to design. because there was growth each time I got a new project. I had 30 years of that with Spike Lee. Robert Townsend. Keenen Ivory Wayans. and the list goes on and on. They also had their desire to be great directors. to tell stories that were unique about the Black community. Black culture. Combined with these stories. these directors. this medium and my desire to also grow as a costume designer. I have amassed a body of work that speaks to young people who are trying to get into this industry. as director. costume designer. or a writer. I mean. they can look at our story and be inspired to follow your dream. because that s what all of us were doing. Now that I m here. I have X amount of films behind me and I m still learning and growing. It means that I have done something that is meaningful. valued and looked up to. It means that I m not the mentee anymore. I m the mentor. And it s a nice place to be. You have led such an incredible career and continue to build a legacy that spans beyond costume design. from your exhibit at the SCAD Museum last year to your collaboration with H&M in 2020. What are you working on next?I m working on  Blade  with Mahershala Ali. which is very exciting. Wesley Snipes did the first three. he actually created the franchise. It s been 25 years since the last  Blade  was produced. so now we re remerging with the new  Blade.  I ve been really focusing on that. and riding high on the upcoming  Wakanda Forever.  anticipating people being excited and wanting to know more about some of the elements that they will experience. So I m bracing myself. How do you balance designing for these very different genres. from horror to contemporary to period pieces and Afrofuturistic action films? Does your process waver when you re navigating different characters from various eras?I m not a one-trick pony. I m an artist. so I want to be multifaceted. I want to be challenged by different genres. I want to take on new aesthetics. That s like cleansing your palate and sipping a new flavor. That s part of the storytelling. Thirty-five years behind me. no two are alike. I did  B.A.P.S.  and I did  I m Gonna Git You Sucka.  but I also did  Malcolm X  and I did Tina Turner s life story. My process doesn t change. I have to be inspired by the story. do research behind the story. imagine a color palette or world that these characters live in so that I can dress them properly. It s a step-by-step process that has similar elements. Before I could even choose an article of clothing. I ve got to know where you live. where it takes place. what is the mood. how you function. and all of those things before I can put a garment on. That s where the storytelling and the artistic process comes in. I enjoy the process.What are your top three favorite projects that you ve done in the past. and why?I enjoyed working with Denzel Washington on several of his projects:  Mo  Better Blues  and  Malcolm X.  I enjoyed working with Spike Lee. so  Chi-Raq  and  Da Sweet Blood of Jesus  had a lot of fashion in it and a lot of avant-garde styling in it. It s easy to say  Black Panther  one and two were favorites. but you learn a lot. None of these are really easy projects. so when you say  favorites  or [ask] if there s an actor or costume that stands out. it s hard to actually call anything a favorite. There s so much to getting it done that each experience is very unique. and you learn from each experience. If I could say I learned a lot from  Shaft  (2000). I learned about the fashion industry. If I could say.  What d you learn the most from?  Maybe it was  Black Panther  because I was working with superheroes and how they re made. Also.  Malcolm X  had five decades in one story. so I learned a lot about all of those decades and how to tell that story of one man s life through childhood to death.What do you hope people feel seeing the imagery and costumes in  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever? I hope that people have an experience that just grabs them and draws them into the screen. If people wear white to see the movie. I hope that the scene that s portrayed in all white makes them feel like they re a part of the experience. Because the picture that was made was done by a group of people that cared very deeply about the subject. the setting. the reason. the intention. Chadwick. there was a lot of love put into the creation of  Wakanda Forever.  I just hope that people feel the love in the movie theater. ,Entertainment News

Lupita Nyong o is reflecting on the death of her close pal and costar Chadwick Boseman. In a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter. the actor — who s currently on a promotional tour for the upcoming Black Panther sequel  Wakanda Forever  — shared that she learned of his tragic death through a text message from fellow Hollywood star. Viola Davis. Boseman. who starred in the 2018 Marvel blockbuster as the iconic T Challa/Black Panther. died in August 2020 at the age of 43 following a four-year battle with colon cancer. Nyong o told THR that although she was aware that Boseman was sick. she hadn t known how serious it was — until she got a text from Davis. I couldn t believe it.  Nyong o said of receiving the message about Boseman s death.  I was paralyzed. He had an aura. He was the leader. and we were all good with it.  He affected how I move in the world.  she added.  But that s the thing about Chadwick. Chadwick wasn t trying to have everyone be like him. What he inspired was you to be your best self.  In 2020. Michael Greene. Boseman s agent. told THR that the late actor s mother. Carolyn Boseman. advised the star to keep his cancer diagnosis a secret.She  always taught him not to have people fuss over him.  Greene said.  He also felt in this business that people trip out about things. and he was a very. very private person. The beloved late actor was also known for his noteworthy roles in  42.   Get on Up.   Marshall  and  21 Bridges.  Four months after Boseman s death. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced that the production company would not recast the role of T Challa.Instead of recasting Boseman s titular character. the film s writers. Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole. decided to include T Challa s death in the sequel s plot. During an interview with THR last year. director Coogler opened up about working on the long-awaited follow-up without Boseman. It s difficult.  Coogler said at the time.  You ve got to keep going when you lose loved ones. I know Chad wouldn t have wanted us to stop. He was somebody who was so about the collective. Black Panther. that was his movie. He was hired to play that role before anybody else was even thought of. before I was hired. before any of the actresses were hired. On that set. he was all about everybody else.

After breaking the Guinness World Record for mixing up the largest gin and juice cocktail in 2018. it looks like Snoop Dogg might be on his way to smashing another record.In an interview with Australian radio show  The Kyle and Jackie O Show.  released on Monday. the West Coast rapper s personal blunt roller. Renagade PerRana. revealed he likes to smoke a whopping 75 to 150 joints per day.  I calculate it at over 450.000.  PerRana said when asked how many joints she s rolled for Snoop since landing the coveted job.  I do about half a pound a day. which is 75 to 150 joints.  She also noted that the  Drop It Like It s Hot  rapper basically never goes anywhere without having a trusty blunt on hand.In 2013. Snoop shared that he smokes around 81 blunts every day during a Twitter Q&A. which aligns with PerRana s estimation. In a recent interview with  The Review  podcast. PerRana shed light on how she scored the role as Snoop s employee after beating out two other candidates in a  roll-off  match.  I had a roll-off with a sound engineer that works with Snoop. that I guess Snoop kind of recommended. and then a Venezuelan cigar roller who rolls big boy stogies at parties.  she recalled.  And I smoked them. to say the least. So from that day forward. I was the premier blunt roller of the planet — blunt roller to the stars now. In June. the longtime rapper. known for his unwavering love of the green bud. spilled the beans on Twitter that he upped his full-time blunt roller s salary due to inflation.After the Twitter account UberFacts tweeted.  Snoop Dogg employs a full-time blunt roller who makes between $40.000 and $50.000 a year.  he swiftly stepped in to share an update. Inflation.

Republican figures are already complaining that it takes too long for some states to tally the vote and using that to cast doubt on election results.MSNBCMehdi HasanDonald TrumpToday. his allies are echoing that talking point even before the election itself. Hasan said the main reason it can take days or longer to count all the votes in some swing states is that  Republican lawmakers in those states have made sure that s the case. GOP-controlled legislatures in several states won t allow election officials to even open mail-in and absentee ballots before Election Day. which can slow the process dramatically.  It doesn t have to be this way.  Hasan said. noting that many red and blue states alike allow votes to be opened and processed ahead of time. But GOP lawmakers in key states are  blocking it. while moaning about election integrity.  he said. They publicly complain about the process. yet work behind the scenes to ensure it remains slow and cumbersome. That s not just dishonest on their part.  he said.  It s straight-up gaslighting.

Donald Trumpmocking nicknameRon DeSantispointedly not invitedMarco RubioU.S. SenateRon DeSanctimoniousTrump was clearly focused on his own future. and apparently didn t give much thought about DeSantis  election battle Tuesday (which he s expected to win easily).But right-wing infighting is not a good look right now. complained critics. What an idiot.  Rod Dreher. senior editor at The American Conservative. piped up on Twitter after Trump s attack on a fellow right-winger. warning that alienating DeSantis supporters is not a savvy strategy.Right-wing Daily Wire writer Matt Walsh scoffed that  Trump isn t going to be able to take  DeSantis down  with a dumb nickname. He better have more than that up his sleeve.  he tweeted. Also. nice job launching your public attack against the most popular conservative governor in America three days before the midterms when we re all supposed to be showing a united front.  Walsh snapped.Fox News contributor Joe Conchas warned that the attack would have a  boomerang effect  on Trump.

RepublicanHerschel WalkerPresident Barack Obamabusiness. academic. professionalphilanthropic achievementsaccused of violence against his family memberspaying for girlfriends  abortions This is a man who lies about the most basic facts of his life.  Warnock said on a stage he shared with Obama.  And now he wants the rest of us ... to somehow imagine now that he s a United States senator. ... Herschel Walker is not ready. He s not ready. Not only is he not ready. He s not fit. Joe Biden He talked about I m not ready. No. you re not ready.  Walker answered Thursday in suburban Atlanta.  Because you either voted with Joe Biden 96% of the time. or you had no clue what you were doing. You pick which one you want — no clue of what you re doing or you voted with him 96% of the time which is headed in the wrong direction. DemocratsRepublicansThe Georgia matchup could help determine which party controls the Senate for the final two years of Biden s term. The chamber is now divided 50-50. with Vice President Kamala Harris giving Democrats the tie-breaking vote.touting his Senate record.But Warnock has stepped up his attacks since two women came forward in October to accuse Walker of encouraging and paying for their abortions when they dated the former professional football star. Walker. who supports a national ban on abortion. has called the allegations  foolishness. The senator s shifts have come alongside polls suggesting a close finish. with the possibility of a runoff. Georgia law requires a majority to win statewide office. and a third-party candidate in the Senate contest could keep Warnock and Walker below that threshold. This man says that he is in law enforcement. He s not. In the FBI. He wasn t.  Warnock told supporters last week during his bus tour. referring to some of Walker s inaccurate claims.  He said that he graduated from the University of Georgia. He did not. He said he was valedictorian (of his high school class). He wasn t. ... He said he had 800 employees. He only had eight. In DeKalb County outside Atlanta. Warnock mocked Walker for carrying an honorary badge. apparently given to him by a Georgia sheriff. as proof of his claims to have worked for years in law enforcement.  He wears his lies quite literally as a badge of honor.  Warnock told voters.Warnock continued to take an aggressive tack Sunday in his hometown of Savannah. and he has Monday stops planned for Macon and Columbus. hiting Georgia s largest metro areas beyond Atlanta. Asked why he d waited so late to attack Walker directly. Warnock said it was in part because the second Walker accuser said in an interview that she  felt threatened  by Walker. who has admitted some violent tendencies in his past but said they were the result of mental illness that he now has under control.Walker rejected Warnock s criticism in a speech Thursday in Smyrna. north of Atlanta. He portrayed himself as the more honest candidate and said his debate with Warnock proved he s up to the job. I took that man to school. I was the adult in that room.  said Walker. who will close his campaign Monday in the GOP-leaning suburbs of Atlanta. He s been talking about me. He even brought in a former president to talk about me.  Walker said. referring to Obama s Oct. 28 visit.Walker said Warnock. who is the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. shouldn t claim to have a Christian ethic while implying Walker doesn t have one.makes faith a major part of his pitchwarning of threats to democracyWalker did not take questions from reporters and has not held an open press availability since the second abortion allegation. another point that Warnock sought to capitalize on ahead of Tuesday. There s nothing stopping him from standing in front of a microphone like I m standing right now.  Warnock told reporters.  The people of Georgia deserve to know what kind of man. what kind of person is he?

One of the top Democrats who is running for reelection in a tight race said Sunday that he believes Democrats are  going to do better than people think on Tuesday.  adding that his party is  not perfect  but  we are responsible adults who believe in this democracy. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.). who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. faces a tough challenge in Tuesday s midterm elections from Republican Mike Lawler. who serves on the New York State Assembly. Maloney represents a suburban district north of New York City. which the Democrat says has always been competitive since he was first elected in 2013. I ve always had a tough race. Chuck.  Maloney told NBC s  Meet the Press  on Sunday.  I beat a Republican to have this seat. I m the first gay person ever elected to Congress from New York. I m raising an interracial family in a county Donald Trump won in 2016 by 20 points. It has always been improbable that I would serve in the Congress. I have to go out and earn it every two years. President Joe Biden is expected to campaign in suburban New York on Sunday. in an effort to use the last few days before the election to sway voters toward vulnerable Democratic candidates like Maloney. After a messy redistricting process in New York that proved disadvantageous for Democrats. the congressman decided to run in the state s new 17th District instead of his current seat in the 18th District. I think this race is razor-close. and I think everybody who cares about the extremism in this MAGA movement ― the racism. the antisemitism. the violence ― needs to get out and vote.  Maloney said.  And that s not just Democrats. that s independents and fair-minded Republicans. Maloney is not the only vulnerable Democrat in this year s midterm elections. Republicans are eyeing major gains on Tuesday ― specifically in the House ― and are appealing to supporters in the final days to punish Democrats for issues like inflation. public safety. women s reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights.At the local level. Democratic candidates have been campaigning on topics like the economy. jobs and abortion rights ― which polls have shown are important to voters. At the national level. however. there is a much bigger stress on how Republican victories. particularly those by far-right. election-denying candidates. could threaten the future of American democracy. Look. what I m telling you is we re not perfect. but we are responsible adults who didn t attack the Capitol on Jan. 6. didn t try to whitewash it. [We] don t pretend we re for law enforcement and then ignore 140 cops getting beat up on that horrible day.  Maloney said.  We re not perfect. but we ve got a plan for gun violence and for bringing jobs back from China. You don t like it. what s yours? We took on the big drug companies. The other side won t do that 'cause they re awash in big drug company money.  he continued.  No. we re not perfect. Chuck. We ve got all kinds of things we can do better. But we are responsible adults who believe in this democracy and we re fighting for a better future. ,Entertainment News
removedHuffPost revealedfirst reported by Teen Vogue.Around the time of HuffPost s revelations. Trevor Project staff had been criticizing Paley s vision for the organization. saying his focus on growth was compromising the quality of counseling that the organization offers to LGBTQ youth in crisis. Many members of our staff have raised concerns about workplace well-being. professional development. prioritization performance metrics. and resourcing compensation — particularly as they impact our BIPOC. transgender. nonbinary. and disabled team members.  The Trevor Project said in a statement to HuffPost.  While a comprehensive. independent review of The Trevor Project is being conducted. the Board of Directors elected to make a change in leadership. The Trevor Project has also engaged outside advisers to launch an investigation into staff complaints. according to a letter the current board chair. Julian Moore. sent to The Trevor Project staff. The letter. seen by HuffPost. did not specify the content of those complaints.At the time of Paley s work with Purdue Pharma — 2016 and 2017 — the opioid epidemic was claiming tens of thousands of lives every year. and Purdue Pharma s reputation was in free fall. HuffPost discovered that Paley was part of a McKinsey team that helped Purdue build a 10-year strategic plan to boost the sales of opioids and other Purdue products.Paley also helped McKinsey compete to handle data analysis for Purdue and compete for a separate project that involved resuscitating Purdue s collapsing public reputation. $573 million settlement If I knew then what I know now. I would not have agreed to do any consulting for that company. and I regret that I did.  Paley said in a statement to HuffPost this summer. Gina Muñoz. the chair of the board. said the board had  full confidence in Amit as CEO of The Trevor Project and stands firmly behind him. rockedresearchAlready. many staffers were distressed by Paley s vision for The Trevor Project: a focus on rapidly scaling up its LGBTQ counseling services. which the staffers claimed was coming at the expense of quality. In the lead up to Paley s exit. more than 200 Trevor Project staffers signed a letter complaining about the breakneck growth.Co-founder Peggy Rajski will reportedly serve as interim CEO. with assistance from Muñoz. It has been the honor of a lifetime to lead The Trevor Project s life-saving team for over five years.  Paley said in a statement to HuffPost. He mentioned that during his time as CEO. the organization s counseling services increased tenfold. became available 24/7. and expanded internationally for the first time. We grew our team from 50 employees to over 500. The Trevor Project s vital work is needed now more than ever. and I will always remain deeply committed to the organization s vision of a world where all LGBTQ young people see a bright future for themselves. ,Entertainment News
Joe Bidenmidterm electionsBiden is dealing with difficult challenges in elections that will set the dynamics for the rest of his first term. Presidents tend to see their party suffer major setbacks in their second year in office. and in addition. Biden is saddled with a cloudy economic picture and the limits of his own popularity.In the campaign s closing sprint. Biden has tried to rely on a message that promotes his accomplishments — many of which will take years to be truly felt — and warns of the consequences of a GOP takeover of Congress.Biden has tried to project resolute optimism about holding Congress. saying Friday that he feels  really good  about keeping majorities in the House and Senate. Advisers maintain that voters still broadly support the president s agenda. even if they are down on the overall direction of the country because of inflation. gas prices and the sour tenor of political discourse.DemocratsWest Virginia Sen. Joe ManchinBiden s advisers insist the current political environment is far different from 2010. when Democratic candidates were hamstrung by the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act. the Obama-era health law. and went on to lose 63 House seats and six Senate seats. Whether you re in Arizona or you re in Nevada. or you re in Pennsylvania. all have Democratic elected officials that are communicating to their constituents. are talking about the things that they got done for the American people that are built on President Biden s vision and what he s accomplished.  White House deputy chief of staff Jen O Malley Dillon said at a forum hosted by Axios last week.  And that is a significant difference from other midterm seasons. In a sign of how Biden hopes his agenda may play out in time. that health law survived dozens of GOP-led repeal attempts and is now broadly popular with voters.Cedric Richmond. the former Louisiana congressman and Biden senior aide who is now a top adviser to the Democratic National Committee. said it was important for Biden in the campaign s closing days to reinforce to voters his accomplishments. One of the things I think that s most important is that he continue to remind people of all the things that he s doing to keep this country going in the right direction.  Richmond said.  We know there are challenges out there. but we re meeting them and we re not dividing the country. Even as Biden says he s trying to bring the country together. he s also warning about what would happen if Republicans win control of Capitol Hill. If we lose the House and Senate. it s going to be a horrible two years.  he said Friday at a fundraiser outside Chicago.He argues that Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare. reverse Democrats  cost-lowering efforts for prescription drugs and impose a national abortion ban.  The good news is I ll have a veto pen.  Biden said.White House officials say that even if Biden hasn t personally been on the ground in some of the most contested states. he s helped set up Democrats there for success by delivering a message that echoes around the country. no matter where he s campaigning.Advisers say Biden bears no ill will toward embattled Democratic candidates in Arizona. Nevada. New Hampshire. Ohio and Georgia who have tried to keep him at arm s length. After 50 years in public life. they say. Biden recognizes that it s often advantageous for the lawmakers to carve out their own identities distinct from the leader of their party.Instead. Biden has turned out for lower-key. but equally competitive House races. where aides and candidates welcome the president s ability to drive local news coverage.For Biden. that s meant more than two dozen political events to boost Democratic candidates since August. along with many ostensibly official events. such as the groundbreaking on a new technology manufacturing facility or a speech to promote plans to cut the price of insulin for older adults. that draw contrast with Republicans.In fact. first lady Jill Biden has proved to be even more in demand than Biden in some places. She campaigned Saturday in Arizona with Sen. Mark Kelly and earlier in New Hampshire with Sen. Maggie Hassan. both in tight reelection races.Over the summer. Democrats seized on the Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade in hopes of motivating women and the party s core supporters. In recent weeks he has stressed his condemnation of  mega MAGA  Republicans — short for the 2016 Trump campaign slogan.  Make America Great Again.the thrust of a speechRepublicans. in the closing days. have zeroed in on people s economic concerns. Biden s agenda has wreaked havoc on families trying to get by.  Ronna McDaniel. the Republican National Committee chairwoman. said Friday.  Lower real wages. higher taxes. and out-of-control inflation have made it tougher for Americans to get ahead. In a few short days. voters will send a clear message that they have had enough of Democrats  radical agenda. Some Democrats. already looking to cast blame ahead of the election. have been critical of Biden s messaging. arguing he should have focused more intently on reassuring Americans about soaring prices. I hope there s some people at the White House watching.  Faiz Shakir. an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders. I-Vt.. told MSNBC on Wednesday hours before Biden s speech.  I d hope that they re rewriting it and focusing on cost of living. Biden allies reject the argument. saying voters care about more than just one issue. They say abortion and the prospect of election-denying candidates help open the door to some GOP-leaning voters to go with Democrats.Richmond. the former Biden adviser. said the president does talk about the economy and what he is doing to tackle inflation.  If a candidate can t articulate that ... that s on them. ,Entertainment News
Key figures in the Democratic Party increasingly view Rep. Tim Ryan s campaign in Ohio this cycle as an important test case for a slew of critical and challenging 2024 Senate races — even if many remain skeptical Ryan can actually pull off a victory on Tuesday.Ryan s U.S. Senate campaign. which has kept him neck and neck with Republican venture capitalist J.D. Vance despite Ohio s conservative lean. the poor overall political environment and a massive outside spending advantage for the GOP. has already become an object of fascination for key operatives and donors. They re hoping to replicate his economic-focused strategy and his approach to breaking with the national party and progressives.Vance has opened up a clear but small lead in public polling over Ryan. though the Democrat is persuading a significant number of voters to split their tickets: Polls typically show him running 5 percentage points or more ahead of former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. the party s gubernatorial nominee. That skill is going to be crucial for Senate Democrats in 2024. when they will have three incumbents — Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio — running for reelection in states Donald Trump won by more than 8 percentage points in 2020. The party has another four incumbents running in states Trump won in 2016 before losing four years later. And it has few obvious pickup opportunities. with Republican-leaning Florida and Texas hosting the most vulnerable senators.Politics in Ohio. like almost all of Democrats  tough Senate seats in 2024. is dominated by white working-class voters. who have moved sharply toward the GOP during the Trump era. Their prevalence in key presidential swing states and dominance of the nation s less-populated states has put Democrats at a significant disadvantage in the Electoral College and Senate. We can t write off big areas of the country and expect to win the Senate.  said former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D). who ran 5 points ahead of President Joe Biden as a Senate candidate in 2020 but lost regardless.  I think people are excited about what Tim has been doing.  Ryan has also won admirers among almost the entire Biden-era Democratic coalition. from Never Trump figures such as Republican Accountability Project founder Sarah Longwell to the major labor unions who funded a super PAC backing Ryan to progressives in the orbit of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The donor network that s built up around LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has been particularly intrigued by Ryan s campaign. three Democratic sources said.It amounts to a massive personal political turnaround for the Youngstown. Ohio. native. who long seemed to have far more star potential than actual political direction. A challenge to Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the Democratic caucus fell flat on its face. his presidential run in 2020 fizzled. its most noteworthy moment potentially a misplaced phone call in which he told a reporter Biden was  declining . he looked and repeatedly passed on statewide bids. and his ideology was difficult to pin down — he once appeared at confabs for the progressive Netroots Nation and the moderate group Third Way in the span of the same month. If you re looking for a quick way to separate Ryan from every other major Democratic Senate candidate this cycle. try this: His campaign never aired a TV ad focused on abortion rights.That isn t to say it shied away from the issue. Ryan targeted liberal and persuadable voters with digital ads on the topic. and Republicans have attacked him for not outlining what abortion restrictions he would support in interviews. But for the messages his campaign was quite literally broadcasting to Ohioans. he stuck to economic issues. attacks on Vance and pledges of independence. Lots of people have bet on abortion as their get-out-of-jail-free card. and Tim didn t.  said Irene Lin. a Cleveland-based Democratic strategist who now works for Welcome PAC. which is wooing Republicans on Ryan s behalf.  He knew kitchen table issues were the winner here. His opening ad of the general election is a classic example: Walking through the Youngstown neighborhood he grew up in. Ryan boasts of voting against a trade deal supported by former President Barack Obama and with Trump on trade deals.  I don t answer to any political party.  he says in the 30-second spot.  I ll work with either party to cut costs and pass a middle-class tax cut. because you deserve some breathing room. To some Democrats. Ryan s simple acknowledgment of economic struggle goes a long way. especially in comparison with attempts by many leading members of the party to spin the economy as stronger than how Americans perceive it to be. You need to show respect for the economic plight of the working class.  said Bullock. who is now the co-chair of the Democratic super PAC American Bridge.  If you don t show up and talk about kitchen table issues. there s a vacuum. And if there s a vacuum. voters will go for the GOP s culture war issues every time.  Ryan has been a steadfast supporter of Biden s legislative agenda. voting for the bipartisan deals on gun safety and infrastructure. Democrats  failed attempt to overhaul voting laws. and the Inflation Reduction Act. But he s also broken with him on key issues. most recently and notably Biden s move to cancel $10.000 or more of student debt for borrowers who make less than $125.000 a year. While the administration worked to make sure nearly all of the benefits went to people making less than $75.000 a year. Ryan nevertheless agreed with critics who said it amounted to a slap in the face to working-class voters who would not benefit.  I think a targeted approach right now really does send the wrong message.  Ryan said on CNN at the time.  There s a lot of people out there making $30.000 or $40.000 who didn t go to college. and they need help as well. Ryan wants Democrats to talk more about vocational education and bringing back manufacturing jobs — ideas that are regularly featured in Democratic campaign ads in the Midwest. but not as frequently by the party-aligned pundits on MSNBC or CNN. And some of Ryan s past missteps have aided him in breaking with the party: Linking him to Pelosi. a favorite Republican tactic. is harder when he challenged her for party leadership. His suggestions Biden shouldn t run for reelection seem more authentic when he first raised issues around Biden s mental acuity in 2020.liberal and Asian American groups It is us versus China.  Ryan says in the ad. which aired in April and was a compendium of his speeches.  And instead of taking them on. Washington is wasting our time on stupid fights. Lin. who is Asian American. said Ryan s ads were not perfect — he should have specified the Chinese Communist Party rather than simply condemning the country — but said his decision showed seriousness about standing up both to China and to the left wing of the Democratic Party.  The fact that most Democrats have allowed Trump to have a monopoly on being anti-China is political malpractice.  Lin said.  And it s maddening to see suburban wine moms and some of my fellow Asian Americans lecture Tim on xenophobia and racism instead of taking seriously all the Ohio towns that have been hollowed out thanks to jobs moving overseas.  The ability. and desire. of Democratic senators up for reelection in 2024 to replicate what Ryan has done will vary from race to race. Manchin. for instance. does not need to take lessons on how to separate himself from the national Democratic brand. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin. on the other end of the spectrum. has a more progressive voting record than Ryan and experience selling it to the Badger State electorate.And while Republicans  struggles to nominate high-quality candidates are likely to continue. not every Democrat will get to face a Republican as troubled as Vance — a gaffe-prone millionaire who left Ohio for an extended period of time and seems to be incapable of raising money for his campaign — as their opponent. once suggestedThe 2024 class of senators has always had plentiful red-state and swing-state Democrats. in part because their elections have occurred in strong years for the party: the 2006 and 2018 midterm waves. and former President Barack Obama s successful 2012 reelection. But the decline of ticket-splitting saw three of those Democrats fall even amid the Democratic wave of 2018: North Dakota s Heidi Heitkamp. Indiana s Joe Donnelly and Missouri s Claire McCaskill.Manchin. who has made his affection for Ryan clear by campaigning with him. is already getting started on his reelection. demanding Biden apologize for suggesting coal plants around the country would soon shut down. Being cavalier about the loss of coal jobs for men and women in West Virginia and across the country who literally put their lives on the line to help build and power this country is offensive and disgusting.  Manchin said on Saturday.  The president owes these incredible workers an immediate and public apology. ,Entertainment News

Social Security and Medicare are at risk should Republicans take control of Congress this week.The president highlighted the Inflation Reduction Action. passed in August by the Democratic-led Congress. which includes several health care provisions popular among older adults and the less well-off. including a $2.000 cap on out-of-pocket medical expenses and a $35 monthly cap per prescription on insulin. The new law also requires companies that raise prices faster than overall inflation to pay Medicare a rebate.But with a bigger and more energetic audience in his home state.

He doesn t have the luxury of an opponent that is a pro-Trump crazy opponent. that is a kind of extreme right-wing. ‘the election is stolen  candidate.  said Anand Sokhey. a political science professor at the University of Colorado. Boulder.  Because Bennet cannot easily run against that like some Democrats around the country. he s pivoting and distinguishing himself on some other things.  But I think also if he had that option ― of just saying. ‘This guy supports Trump and you don t want that and here I am  ― it would be a way easier message to communicate.  Sokhey added. Bennet s early career suggested that he would follow in the centrist footsteps of his predecessor. former Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.). whom he was tapped to replace when then-President Barack Obama appointed Salazar secretary of the interior in 2009.Bennet. a Wesleyan and Yale-educated attorney. moved to Colorado in the late 1990s to accept a role as managing director for billionaire Philip Anschutz s private investment firm. He played a key role in overseeing the consolidation of three bankrupt movie theater chains into the massive Regal Entertainment Group.Bennet went on to serve as then-Denver Mayor Hickenlooper s chief of staff and superintendent of Denver s public schools. In 2009. then-Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter (D) appointed Bennet. a political newcomer. to serve in the Senate.In keeping with the fiscal austerity craze in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis ― and perhaps his own centrist inclinations ― Bennet made debt reduction a priority during his first year in office. At a time when housing advocates were desperate for the Obama administration to use more of the Wall Street bailout money to help struggling homeowners. Bennet passed a budget amendment reducing the size of the financial industry bailout and requiring the federal government to use any unused funds to pay down the national debt.Bennet touted the  pay it back  plan in a TV ad during his 2010 run for a full Senate term.Another 2010 TV spot.  Common Sense.  also reflected Bennet s efforts to appeal to business-friendly moderates in Colorado. Michael Bennet s a businessman who saved jobs.  the narrator says.  In his year in the Senate. he s fought for tax cuts for the middle class and helped pass tax cuts for small businesses so they can create jobs. Bennet s campaign website in 2010 even included a section on  entitlement reform.  a term often used by conservatives for making changes to Social Security and Medicare. Referring to those two programs. Bennet wrote.  We must find a way to preserve the integrity of these programs while reducing the increasingly large impact they have on the overall federal budget.  (More recently. Bennet has said that he wants to increase Social Security benefits for the most vulnerable. and sees lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes. among other revenue increases. as the best route for closing Social Security s funding gap.)As Bennet s Senate career progressed. he began championing more ambitious and traditionally liberal bills.

Bennet has never veered into the most progressive corner of the Senate Democratic Caucus. create  Medicare X. In fact. Bennet developed a reputation as something of a gladiator against the left wing of the party during his short-lived presidential run in the 2020 election cycle. He used his limited campaign funds to attack Medicare for All. Sanders  signature policy. in TV ads. ripping it for requiring Americans to drop their current insurance and enroll in a newly expanded federal program. one spotconfronted him The themes that he campaigned on were awful.  said David Sirota. a Denver-based progressive journalist who worked on Sanders  2020 presidential campaign.Sirota called Bennet s focus on attacking Medicare for All  very discordant from somebody who says. ‘I care about economic inequality.  Bennet stands by his decision to run those ads. He said it was precisely his focus on reducing poverty and economic inequality that motivated him to run for president ― and limited his patience for what he sees as the wrong kinds of solutions. I have not changed. I still don t think Medicare for All is a good idea. I don t think it s a good substantive idea. I don t think politically it s a good idea.  he told HuffPost.  I think reversing the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and having a permanent child tax credit and an enhanced Earned Income Tax Credit. having the alternative corporate minimum tax ― those are really good substantively and really good politically. But Bennet admits that hearing the stories of working families struggling to make ends meet ― first as superintendent of Denver public schools. and later. as a U.S. senator ― has made him more empathetic to their needs than he was while working in the private sector. What I have learned during the time that I was in the Senate is that we have the worst income inequality that we ve had since the 1920s.  he said. before rattling off a series of economic criteria on which the United States ranks poorly among developed nations.  Those are things I didn t completely comprehend. Nowadays. even Sirota gives him credit for running unabashedly on progressive economic policies like the expanded child tax credit. He understands the salience of economic issues. which is more than you can say of most Democratic senators.  Sirota said. Most outside experts do not see O Dea s campaign to unseat Bennet as especially competitive. University of Colorado. Boulder. poll2-to-1 marginequally great I will be surprised if [Bennet] falls short.  Sokhey. the University of Colorado political scientist. said.But unlike many of the statewide Republican candidates expected to lose in an otherwise strong cycle for the GOP. O Dea s underdog status is not due to any glaring flaws he has as a candidate. carpenter and a contractor Bennet  dumped $1.9 trillion into our economy that s caused record inflation.  O Dea said in an Oct. 28 debate at the Colorado State University campus in Fort Collins.  Compound that with a war on energy fully backed by Michael Bennet and Joe Biden that s caused record inflation on gas and diesel prices directly reflected in the fertilizer price.  windfall profits tax has said I started thinking about Joe Biden serving another four years. and you serving another six years and I gotta tell you: It s terrifying.  O Dea said.At least one swing voter with whom HuffPost spoke found O Dea s anti-inflation message compelling. Fred Lewis. a retired federal employee and registered Republican from Greenwood Village. said he voted for Biden in 2020 because he found Trump  scary. Now he s voting for O Dea.  I m tired of what the Democrats are doing here.  Lewis said.  They re spending too much money. Indeed. to many Colorado Republicans. a business-minded conservative like O Dea is exactly the kind of person who can appeal to moderate Democrats and independents in a highly-educated state where Trump was unpopular.Dr. John Sacha. a Denver spinal surgeon who had come to hear O Dea and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) speak at an alpine-themed bar on Oct. 29. believes that O Dea s relative leniency on issues like abortion is a good fit for Colorado Republicans. We re liberal Republicans.  he said.  We re more middle of the road on social issues. but we re far right when it comes to everything fiscal. To appeal to those voters. O Dea supports codifying same-sex marriage in law and said he would back federal legislation codifying abortion rights up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. with exceptions for rape. incest. and the life of the mother after that cutoff point. He also said he would have voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill and wants to give Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children ― legal status. albeit only as part of a comprehensive bill that improves border security. Rather than Trump or a member of the Republican GOP Conference. O Dea cites Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) as a model for the kind of independence he plans to embody as a senator.  When I m in the U.S. Senate. I m going to use my seat.  he said at the Oct. 28 debate.  I m going to use my seat like Joe Manchin has used his seat to get good things for West Virginia. his 2020 voterape and incestAt the same time. social conservatives are hardly enthusiastic about going to the polls for O Dea. Curt Clifton. a retired engineer from Aurora who was wearing a Trump hat. said he did  not particularly  like O Dea.  but I don t like the Democrat a whole lot worse. His wife. Cathy. a retired nurse and anti-abortion activist. is also going to hold her nose while voting for O Dea.  I don t really know if he s against abortion at the last minute ― at 38 weeks or 40 weeks or something.  she said.Another factor working in Bennet s favor is the presence of Brian Peotter. a Libertarian Party candidate. on the Senate ballot. O Dea clearly sees Peotter as a greater threat to his share of the vote than to Bennet s. The bottom line is: a vote for the Libertarian is a vote for Michael Bennet.  O Dea told HuffPost after his event with Christie.  And I know all those libertarians. none of them have anything in common with Michael Bennet.  more than 50%3.6% of the voteIn reality. O Dea s biggest obstacle is the same partisan polarization affecting Democrats in increasingly red states. It s the kind of political force of nature that makes it unlikely that Rep. Tim Ryan (D) will win in Ohio s Senate race. or that Rep. Val Demings (D) will win in Florida s Senate race. despite their strengths as candidates. When a state s tribal identity shifts in a more decisive partisan direction. it becomes harder for voters to see any candidate outside of that lens ― especially in congressional races. Is [O Dea] actually going to be able to get much of the crossover vote?  Sokhey said.  Probably not. in the era of polarization that we re in. On the other hand. if O Dea prevails against the odds. he is likely to be held up as a model for GOP success in similarly difficult terrain. His victory would also speak to the extent of the political backlash to inflation and its perceived link to Biden s policies. If Bennet loses. it s a very bad night for the Democrats nationally. and it s probably a bad night for them in Colorado in some other dimensions too.  Sokhey said.,Entertainment News
DETROIT. Mich. — Gretchen Whitmer loves to talk about unity and common purpose. She did it in 2018. when she first ran for governor of Michigan. a Democrat promising to  fix the damn roads  and to work with Republicans on solving manageable problems. And she s doing it now. as she runs for a second term. In a televised debate with her GOP opponent two weeks ago. she started by citing the virtues of bipartisanship and proclaiming that  we all want the same things. But nowadays. the idea that everybody shares common values is a dubious proposition at best — across the country. as in Michigan. And Whitmer knows that better than anyone.State Republicans have called her and her allies in government  witches.  described her as a tyrant and sued to strip away her emergency powers. Some of their supporters have marched on and then into the Capitol building while brandishing semi-automatic rifles. A handful of militia members plotted to kidnap her. while some talked about hanging her. before the FBI arrested them. The backdrop for the plot. the protests and the name-calling was Whitmer s public health orders during the first months of the pandemic. and the wrath they brought from former President Donald Trump. who was tweeting things like  LIBERATE MICHIGAN!  At a rally in Lansing. Trump. indignant that Whitmer continued to criticize him after  our people  helped her — an apparent reference to federal law enforcement arresting the would-be kidnappers — mused of the affair:  People are entitled to say maybe it was a problem. Maybe it wasn t.  The major public health orders lapsed long ago and Trump isn t president anymore. But the animosity toward Whitmer has endured. and Trump s supporters. who now control the state party. have put forward a slate of candidates who think. talk and promise to act like him. Tudor Dixon. Whitmer s challenger. is one of them. A former actor. business manager and right-wing commentator. Dixon has accused Whitmer of backing  radical sex and gender activists  who put  pornography  in schools. of trying to defund the police rather than fight crime. and of using taxpayer dollars to subsidize Chinese communists. She routinely refers to Whitmer as  Gretchen  rather than using her title and. during a September campaign swing where Donald Trump Jr. was a guest. she used the abduction plot as the punchline of a joke about Whitmer s COVID-19 closure orders.  For someone so worried about being kidnapped.  Dixon said.  Gretchen Whitmer sure is good at taking business hostage and holding it for ransom. Behind Dixon s rhetoric is a far-right agenda with far-reaching potential to change life in Michigan. especially if Republicans win other statewide races and keep control of the legislature. A school funding proposal backed by former Trump Cabinet member Betsy DeVos could lead to a program that puts public money into private schools. Abortion could become illegal. thanks to a 1931 prohibition that Republicans have said they will enforce. And the state s election machinery could fall into the hands of Trump supporters determined to  stop the steal  in 2024. when Michigan s electoral votes could plausibly determine who wins the White House.To succeed. Republicans need to get past Whitmer. And they ve got plenty of voters cheering them on. The people here are as anxious about inflation and crime as any in America. Many are angry about the way pandemic restrictions affected their lives. or about what their kids are learning (and not learning) in school. Whitmer has to answer for all of this. just like so many other Democrats running for office this year.But Whitmer has a lot going for her. too. I have followed her career closely. going back to that 2018 campaign. when I interviewed her as she was making the rounds in suburban Detroit diners. I tracked her efforts to fix the roads and to steer the state through COVID. For the last three months. I ve been attending campaign events. interviewing people who love her and people who hate her. and speaking directly with her in a series of short conversations.Whitmer has a flair for retail politics that even her adversaries acknowledge. She can point to bipartisan legislative accomplishments as well as evidence that her actions on COVID ultimately saved many thousands of lives. She s also built a devoted following among voters who have come to see her as somebody who thinks and talks like they do. and will protect them fiercely when their interests. freedoms or very lives are in jeopardy.That s especially true when it comes to reproductive rights. Dixon says abortion should be illegal in nearly all cases. including rape and incest. explaining in one interview that the experience of carrying a baby in those circumstances can create  healing.  Whitmer. who has spoken about her own experience as a rape victim having to contemplate a possible pregnancy. has pledged to block Michigan s 1931 ban with whatever authority she has. She s done it once already: If not for a lawsuit she filed early this year. some conservative county prosecutors might be bringing cases right now.Whitmer s lead in the FiveThirtyEight polling average has shrunk from double digits to about five points. where it has stabilized. It s anybody s guess whether the campaign dynamics have really changed or whether polls are simply recognizing a tighter race that was there all along. It s also impossible to know whether surveys are undercounting Republicans or if there will be a late shift in the GOP direction. which is what happened in the 2016 presidential election. when nearly every poll predicted Hillary Clinton would win Michigan — right up until she didn t. The backlash to that election. and Trump s presidency. helped make Whitmer governor. When Trump went on to lose his own reelection bid. leaving a trail of blood at the U.S. Capitol on his way out the door. there was some hope that his brand of politics would subside within the Republican Party. Dixon s candidacy is proof that it hasn t. and as Michigan goes this fall. so too may go the country in two short years. Gretchen Whitmer is sitting across the table at a suburban Detroit high school. talking about one of her favorite subjects: her mom and dad. It s late August and she has just finished a roundtable with educators and parents. Now she s explaining how her parents both worked in government. and how they were able to get along even though her father. Richard Whitmer. was a Republican and her mother. Sherry Reisig Whitmer. was a Democrat. I ask what dinner conversation was like. whether there were grand policy debates like the Roosevelts. Kennedys or — to use a Michigan example — the Romneys once had. Not really. she says. They came from a long line of educators and ministers. or  teachers and preachers  as she likes to put it. and saw themselves as heirs to that tradition.  I think there s a tendency to conflate politics and public service.  Whitmer said.  but they were public servants. Whitmer talks about her parents and their politics a lot. but there s a coda that she doesn t mention so frequently. It s about her father s patron. Republican William Milliken. who was the longest-serving governor in Michigan history and had a reputation for working with his adversaries. especially on issues like the environment. In his later years. Milliken watched the GOP drift temperamentally and philosophically — until 2016. when it nominated Trump to be president.  This nation has long prided itself on its abiding commitments to tolerance. civility and equality.  Milliken explained in a statement endorsing Clinton.  I am saddened and dismayed that the Republican Party this year has nominated a candidate who has repeatedly demonstrated that he does not embrace those ideals. State GOP leaders attacked him as a  RINO  (Republican in name only). His county GOP chapter officially disavowed him. Whitmer s father took notice of what was happening to his mentor. and she did too.  They were calling him a RINO ― Bill Milliken. a RINO ― and I think that was one of those times where I realized. OK. this is changing and in fundamental and important ways.  It was especially jarring for Whitmer. because her career in politics began in a world much more similar to that of her parents. Despite some earlier aspirations for a career in sports journalism — she was eyeing the anchor desk at ESPN. not the governor s chair in the legislature — she opted for politics following a college internship in the state House during the early 1990s. At the time. the two parties had a formal power-sharing arrangement. alternating leadership posts each month. because they had exactly the same number of seats. It could have been complete chaos and gridlock.  Whitmer recalled.  But instead. these leaders said. ‘You know what? These are the facts we re dealing with. so we ve got to figure out how to make it work.  And every other month. they d switch who chaired committees. and no one was jamming their agenda down someone else s throat because they knew. all right. if we don t play fairly this month. they re going to serve it right back to us next month. Not that Whitmer thought the parties were the same. She identified as a Democrat — mainly. she told me. because Democrats were the ones focusing on protecting women s rights and using government to promote economic fairness. But while she proved a capable partisan as a member of the state legislature. eventually moving from the House to the Senate and becoming the Democratic leader. she nurtured relationships with GOP leaders — including Gov. Rick Snyder. a business-oriented Republican who in 2013 wanted to expand Michigan s Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act. After he ran into opposition from GOP senators hung up on the initiative s association with  Obamacare.  Whitmer rounded up the Democratic votes it needed to get a majority. More than a million Michiganders have health insurance as a result. She s not a bomb-thrower.  said Jordan Acker. a trial lawyer and longtime Democratic activist who is now one of the statewide elected Regents for the University of Michigan.  She s somebody who s interested in legislating. not game-playing. Whitmer filed papers to run for governor in January 2017. She spent the next year criss-crossing the state. lining up endorsements and filling a war chest with donations. It was enough to scare off would-be challengers from the party establishment and left her with just one main rival: Abdul El-Sayed. a former public health director from Detroit.El-Sayed was a young. relatively unknown progressive whose platform included a state version of  Medicare for All.  Whitmer s backers were thrilled she would have the chance to position herself as the moderate in the race. which was both how she felt most comfortable and. they figured. how she could best appeal to swing voters. But El-Sayed. a former Rhodes scholar. was a sharp debater and electrifying speaker whose grassroots support threatened to turn the campaign into a rerun of the Clinton-Bernie Sanders 2016 primary ― only this time. with a progressive who could win.It was in the face of that challenge that Whitmer settled on her  fix the damn roads  pledge. which in addition to addressing an issue on the minds of Michiganders — the state really does have some of the nation s worst roads  — conveyed her commitment to focusing on narrower. more carefully tailored initiatives. No less important. it wasn t wonk-speak: She said  roads.  not  infrastructure.  and not just roads but the damn roads. Some allies say that ability to communicate in a relatable way is what first drew them to her.  I remember seeing her for the first time. in this small group. and I m not sure what I was expecting.  said Mallory McMorrow. who at the time ran a small consulting firm and was living in the northern Detroit suburbs. and is now a Democratic state senator.  And she starts talking about her daughter. and the ways she wants to make Michigan a better place for her. and I m like. ‘OK. this is a normal person.  Whitmer and her team cultivate that image. this summer. they called local campaign events  Grillin  with Gretchen.  But it also seems to come naturally to somebody famous around Lansing for her playful Michigan boosterism and attendance at college football tailgates. not to mention a Michigan accent probably most detectable when she rushes through words or flattens out her  a  sounds with a nasal twang. so that  appreciate  becomes  uh-pre-shate  and  supposed  turns into  sposed.  Whitmer s ability to come across as Michigan s everywoman may help her avoid the elitist label that has made it difficult for Democrats like Clinton to connect with average voters. Of course. Clinton faced another. equally familiar political problem during her presidential bid: She was a woman. Although attitudes about gender have evolved a great deal in the past few decades. political scientists like Kelly Dittmar of Rutgers University say women still face a penalty when seeking offices like president or governor because  those traits most associated Gender doesn t just come into play via internalized biases. Whitmer experienced plenty of blatant sexism. In the legislature. men were always commenting on Whitmer s looks. in 2008. after the men s magazine Maxim ranked her No. 8 on its list of 10  hottest politicians  in the world. a few even started calling her  ocho.   It was there every day.  Whitmer told me.  And like every woman in that position. I had to do a lot of mental gymnastics to figure out. how do I respond to it? Do I laugh at it? Do I pretend I didn t hear it? Do I take it on? Is this a moment where I could maybe educate someone. help them to be a better colleague? During the 2018 campaign. a debate coach advised her to put smiley face drawings on her notes. as a reminder to avoid seeming too intense when she was on the attack.  That s just so saccharine. like — a smiley face is not going to make me smile.  she later told BuzzFeed. Then she remembered a line from a stand-up show she d seen recently. about women saying  it s shark week. motherf**ker  as a way to show they were no longer afraid to talk about their menstrual cycles. She started writing  It s shark week  on her notes.  It s funny and it s about women s empowerment. and it makes me smile. (Two years later. as she was doing a camera test for her virtual address to the 2020 Democratic convention. she said  It s shark week  and then mouthed  motherf**ker  without saying it.  I have learned about the hot mic.  she joked.)Like so many women. Whitmer has had to balance work with caregiving. including at one of the most critical moments of her career. Right near the end of her first legislature campaign. her mother got a terminal cancer diagnosis. Over the next 20 months. as she took office while also becoming pregnant and then giving birth to her first child. Whitmer was sometimes spending hours a day with her mother. if not helping with the care then helping with the bills.  I remember going to her house.  Whitmer recounted.  and she s at the kitchen table with her head wrapped from the chemo. and in her hands. while we re going through insurance company denials. Almost two decades later. in her general election for governor. Whitmer used that story to bludgeon Bill Schuette. the Republican attorney general who had been a leader in the fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It almost certainly helped Whitmer win over women voters. who were among the population groups most angry about Obamacare repeal. and who recognized in Whitmer one of their own. Their high turnout was a big reason Whitmer won.In her election night victory speech. Whitmer returned to her themes of unity and cooperation. adding a personal touch when she thanked her ex-husband. who was in attendance. for being such a great father to their daughters. And of course she vowed to fix those damn roads. But that effort quickly ran into trouble. As a candidate. she had dodged questions about funding and left her plans vague. Then. as governor. she proposed a new tax on gasoline. arguing consumers would save enough on car repair to offset the higher costs. Republicans rejected it and Democrats said they wouldn t promote it. She has since used executive authority to finance a road plan with bonds. and data suggests the overall condition of roads has improved with plenty of work underway. (Detroit Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan. a Whitmer supporter. says it s like Michigan has been  invaded by orange and white cones. ) But the plan covers only some of the highways that need work. Whitmer had better luck with a bipartisan auto insurance initiative that lowered rates by nearly 20% in its first year. according to a University of Michigan study. But the new law also drained money that had been subsidizing home care for victims of serious accidents. and many people lost caregivers as a result. Among those affected was the brother of journalist Chad Livengood. who wrote an award-winning series of columns for Crain s Detroit Business about the toll it was taking on families like his. Whitmer has said she s pushing the legislature to address this. In the meantime. a state court has intervened to push caregiver rates back up.Whitmer s clearest and biggest legislative accomplishment may be a series of programs to help finance higher education. including one that makes community college essentially free. It addresses a relative lack of skilled workers that has dissuaded some large employers from locating headquarters here. including Amazon when it rejected Detroit s bid for HQ2 back in 2018. Already more than 18.000 Michiganders have enrolled under one key initiative. according to official statistics. and that s for a program that didn t even launch until 2021.But it s not clear how much Whitmer s legislative record has registered with the public. because the dominant storyline of her tenure ― and. until recently. in her reelection campaign ― has been her management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Michigan was among the states hit earliest and hardest by COVID. The virus spread quickly through the Detroit area. where the population s high rates of underlying conditions like lung disease and diabetes were the equivalent of biological kindling. The patient load overwhelmed facilities and. at one point. the state s second-largest hospital system issued guidance on how to ration ventilators. because they were about to run out.In those early weeks. Whitmer was scrambling to find supplies while figuring out what public health measures to take amid inevitable public skepticism.  I remember her calling me.  Debbie Dingell. the veteran House Democrat from the Detroit area. told me recently.  I remember her saying. word for word. ‘These people s lives are in my hands. If I don t make the right decision. they re going to die.  It was in her voice. She understood. at her core.  During this period. Whitmer consulted regularly with several groups of outside experts. some from the state s universities and others from around the country. One of those advisers was Ezekiel Emanuel. the physician and former Obama administration official. who also advised several governors during the pandemic.  I was very impressed. She asked really good questions.  said Emanuel. who is now a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania.  She was also very clear about limitations. things she couldn t do … [she would say] I can impose these requirements or impose restrictions. but if the public isn t there or isn t going to adhere to them. they d do no good. To help with the public. Whitmer was counting on support from Republican leaders ― and. at the pandemic s start. she got it. In early March. when she closed school buildings and limited gatherings to less than 250 people. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey issued a statement for Republicans:  While this action may seem severe. we believe it is appropriate.  He issued similar statements a week later. when she issued a full stay-at-home order. and early the next month when she closed schools for the duration of the year.But after that. Republicans stopped supporting Whitmer and started criticizing her. eventually filing lawsuits saying that she had exceeded her emergency powers under existing Michigan law. They won those cases. Whitmer was able to continue issuing orders through the Health Department. which has separate legal authority. Shirkey in particular became a vocal critic of Whitmer s shutdown orders. at one point challenging her to a  fistfight on the lawn  of the Capitol grounds. He also bragged that he had  spanked her hard  in legislative negotiations. (Months later. a fellow Republican angry over Whitmer s posture on COVID said she had  emasculated  her partisan opponents.) Republicans say they started speaking out because Whitmer had gone too far. was causing too much damage to businesses and wasn t serious about soliciting or heeding their input. Plenty of conservatives. including those at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. agreed about the policy effects and produced research making the substantive case against her orders.Whitmer says GOP leaders in Michigan were taking their cue from another Republican — the one in the White House — and feeding off the volatile political energy he was pouring into the state.The fight between Trump and Whitmer started after a conference call in which the president told governors they had to take the lead on getting personal protective gear and other supplies. Whitmer was among the few participants who responded publicly. though carefully. saying the White House had to do more. Trump. who was still trying to downplay the pandemic. complained to Sean Hannity on Fox News about  that woman in Michigan  who was being  unpleasant.  Whitmer answered with a tweet. saying.  Hi. my name is Gretchen Whitmer. and that governor is me. I ve asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks. just PPEs. ventilators. N95 masks. test kits. You said you stand with Michigan — prove it. It was a few weeks after that Trump started attacking Whitmer for her closure orders. and the protests began with a caravan of MAGA-hat-wearing drivers blocking the streets of Lansing. Whitmer s stance in the face of that pressure impressed some Michiganders. reminding them of what had made them like her so much in the first place.  I thought she came across as Michigan s mom. like she s going to protect the state and everybody in it. in the way that a mom does.  McMorrow said.  There was a willingness to make really tough decisions to do what is best for the health and safety and basic well-being of your kids ― or in this case. your constituents ― knowing that some people are not going to like it. Whitmer also made an impression on Detroit s Black voters. who had always supported her but not necessarily with a lot of enthusiasm.  I don t know if anybody else felt [the pandemic s first wave] the way that Detroit felt it.  said Danielle Atkinson. a longtime political organizer in southeastern Michigan and founding director of Mothering Justice. a national organization focusing on the interests of mothers from communities of color.  Every day. notable people were dying. it was everywhere. and when she shut everything down. it felt like she was saving our lives ― like she was saying. ‘I m going to do this. no matter the political cost.  And that goes a really long way. Whitmer in our conversations mentioned the inspiration she took from her grandfather. Dana Whitmer. who was superintendent for schools in Pontiac. the suburb north of Detroit. during court-ordered integration in the 1970s. Members of the Ku Klux Klan tried to block the plan. blowing up 10 buses. Dana Whitmer pushed ahead anyway. saying all kids in Pontiac deserved an equal education. and stuck by it even when he received threats on his own life.  They called him the ‘silver fox.  because he had this head of white hair. but also because he was cool under pressure.  Gretchen Whitmer told me.Dana Whitmer won praise from the civil rights community and. some 50 years later during the pandemic. his granddaughter found some acclaim of her own. In late March of 2020. just as Gretchen Whitmer was going at it with Trump. an 18-year-old Detroit resident named Janeé Wiseman found a photoshopped image of the governor wearing a pair of Cartier buffalo horn-rimmed sunglasses. She tweeted it out — metaphorically giving her  Buffs.  understood as a sign of respect — and calling Whitmer  Big Gretch. The post went viral. A few weeks later. after the first of the protests where a crowd of overwhelmingly white men in hunting gear and long beards showed up. one follower told Whitmer not to worry about the  hillbillies.  Eventually the Detroit rapper Gmac Cash recorded a song out of it. with lyrics mocking the protesters and Trump. and promising that  We ain t even  bout to stress. we got Big Gretch. People like that are probably among the one-fourth of Michiganders who. according to a recent Detroit News poll. said Whitmer s handling of the pandemic has made them more likely to vote for her this year. But there s another group who say Whitmer s pandemic management has made them less likely to support her. There appear to be more of them — about a third of the population. according to that same Detroit News poll. They are more vocal too. Lock her up ... lock her up ... lock her up. The chant reverberates through the indoor sports complex at Macomb Community College. north of Detroit. where a few thousand Trump supporters have gathered to see him lead a rally. It s early October. and the agenda includes a speech by Marjorie Taylor Greene. the House Republican from Georgia.  Democrats want Republicans dead.  she warns.  and they have already started the killings.  Also on the program are GOP nominees for office in Michigan. including attorney general candidate Matt DePerno. a 2020 election denier now under investigation for alleged tampering with ballot machines. and secretary of state nominee Kristina Karamo. another election conspiracy theorist who has said Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish are putting children under  satanic delusion.  Dixon speaks towards the end. She won the GOP nomination after half of the Republican candidates. including presumed front-runner and former Detroit Police Chief James Craig. failed to qualify for the ballot because of fraudulent signatures on their nomination petitions. She hadn t gotten a lot of attention until that point and. at the rally. with only a little more than a month to go before Election Day. she is still an unknown quantity to many voters. Both DePerno and Karamo have what look like dozens. maybe even a few hundred. T-shirt-wearing supporters on the floor. I see only two people in Dixon gear.Not that any of the Trump supporters present need a reason to vote for Whitmer s opponent. In interviews. they blast the governor for her management of COVID. focusing on a series of embarrassing episodes when the governor or those close to her appeared to be flouting her own rules or seeking special treatment. Literally every single one I interview mentions the time in May 2020 when Whitmer s husband. Marc Mallory. was asking the company that manages their boat in northern Michigan to get it in the water so they could use it for Memorial Day. When the manager told him that might not be possible. because of a backlog from recently expired shutdown orders and a staffing shortage. Mallory asked whether his marriage to the governor made a difference. When word got out ― the manager posted about it on social media ― Whitmer apologized and called it a  failed attempt at humor.  She goes and does what she told other people they cannot do.  John Tretchler. 54. tells me.  Her husband goes and does what she said people couldn t do. We remember these things. In her speech. Dixon mentions some of those episodes. as she frequently does in her campaign appearances. But mostly she has focused on orders to shut down businesses and Whitmer s management of nursing homes. which she says needlessly exposed some to COVID while making it impossible for relatives to visit. She has especially strong feelings about that last part because her grandmother died during the pandemic. She didn t have COVID. but she was in a nursing home and subject to the isolation orders — as Dixon learned firsthand when she. her sister and their kids visited. I stepped back and my sister was at the window. with my four daughters and her daughter. and I took a picture of them because I m thinking. this is the last time they will see her.  Dixon recounted at a recent event.  But they re seeing her through the slats in the drapery and the blinds. And when I look back at that picture now. there are families all down the row. all looking in those windows. Dixon is channeling the anger and anguish many Michiganders still feel. But Dixon. who as a commentator invoked some COVID-related conspiracy theories. hasn t been specific about what choices she would have made instead or what they would have meant for mortality ― especially in light of studies suggesting that Whitmer s shutdown orders could have saved tens. and maybe hundreds. of thousands of lives. Nor has Dixon reckoned with an independent review of the nursing home management early in the pandemic that found Whitmer s strategy to be sound. or the very real dilemmas officials faced at a time when all health facilities were overwhelmed.A very different case against Whitmer s COVID management is one that Dixon would not make ― namely. that Whitmer in early 2021 eased restrictions on in-person dining too quickly. over the objections of Robert Gordon. who at the time was secretary of health. He abruptly left the administration on the day Whitmer announced the new dining rules. Emails that Craig Mauger of the Detroit News later obtained through public records confirmed that Gordon had pushed for a more gradual change. given signs that the delta variant was about to hit. (Gordon. who now serves in the Biden administration. declined to comment for this story.)Gordon wasn t the only one raising such concerns. some independent public health experts did too. And in the weeks that followed the announcements. the delta variant devastated Michigan. killing tens of thousands. But even some of the experts who were pushing Whitmer to dial back restrictions more slowly acknowledge the difficulty she faced at the time. given public exasperation with COVID rules. and credit her with standing up to Trump when he was sending all that vitriol her way. I think she did a great job.  said El-Sayed. an epidemiologist by training who amid the 2021 delta surge had urged Whitmer to reopen the state more slowly and tie COVID rules to vaccination rates.  There was a lot of pressure and ... it wasn t just coming from. you know. angry white dudes across Michigan.  he added. referring to the kidnap plotters and Lansing protesters.  It was a particular angry white dude in Washington. To withstand that pressure. and act on behalf of the people in Michigan. there s a lot to be commended there. Whitmer. for her part. told me that  if I had that benefit of a time machine now. I certainly would do some things differently. But that s the nature of a novel virus and that s why we listened to the best public health people we could find. You move quickly when lives are on the line. During one of the GOP primary debates for governor. a moderator asked the hopefuls about the 2020 election. Dixon was among those saying Trump had won. She had tweeted similar things before and. at the next debate. she said the outcome was not  fair.  Since then. Dixon has adopted a different posture. raising questions about the election result rather than challenging it directly. But she still will not say that Biden won. which is something she has in common with Republicans all over the country.That brand of politics has alienated large swaths of the old GOP establishment. including Jeff Timmer. a former state party official who in September told MLive reporter Simon Schuster that Dixon was  fueling the lies that have weakened our democracy and brought us to this point where the faith in our elections is hanging by a thread.  Timmer helped found a group called  Republicans for Whitmer.  with more than 100 members. one of them. a longtime Chamber of Commerce official Bob LaBrant. wrote a Detroit Free Press op-ed contrasting Dixon to prior GOP governors he knew. like Milliken. who had steered the state through crises  because they were serious people.  The op-ed called Dixon part of the  the most unqualified state-level ticket in recent Michigan history.  But Dixon is still making a play for undecided voters. and a big part of that is her focus on schools. Dixon has pounded Whitmer for pandemic school closures and extended hybrid instruction. which in some districts lasted into 2021. Whitmer has noted she closed schools for only three months in the spring of 2020. after which it was up to districts. to whom she provided a blueprint for reopening. But other governors (including Democrat Gina Raimondo. who was Rhode Island s governor at the time) used leverage they had through budgets or public opinion to force reopenings. And new data suggests Michigan s kids have suffered major learning loss. though the relationship between closures and academics remains the subject of much debate.In the last few weeks. Dixon has fused this COVID-related critique on schools with an unfounded. inflammatory claim that conservatives around the country have been making — that Whitmer is condoning the sexualization or  indoctrination  of children by supporting officials. administrators and teachers who have made what Dixon considers explicit material available to children at young ages. The material Dixon has in mind is LGBTQ-themed and. as in other parts of the country. it has been the subject of some explosive school meetings featuring protesters who say parents need more information about ― and more control over ― both what books students can read and what lessons they are getting in class. Dixon. campaigning for what she calls  parents  rights.  has called for the state s superintendent of schools to resign and for putting the department he runs under the governor s direct control. Whitmer has said she agrees parents have a right to know what s going on in their schools and to have some say over how schools operate. But she hasn t called for resignations or fundamental changes in the way the state manages schools. and she has accused Dixon of trying to exploit the situation for political gain.  She s going into a community next week. where there s already been so much consternation. with groups being pitted against one another.  Whitmer told me last weekend. referring to an upcoming rally that Dixon had scheduled for Dearborn. where some of the school board clashes took place.  She s not going in with a solution. She s going in to give herself some political advantage. to score some political points. I think that s destructive. Leadership is about trying to turn down the heat and solve problems. not about throwing gas on the fire to help yourself politically. Whitmer is a well-known ally and has been a regular at Pride events. At a campaign appearance in Ann Arbor this past weekend. while she was walking through an open-air farmers market and enthusiastic supporters were queuing up to get photos with her. she spotted one young man with long white hair and brightly painted nails — and seemed to make a point of reaching out to him. to make sure he got a photo with her too. When the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization. probably no politician in America was more vocal in their criticism than Whitmer ― and quite possibly none was more ready for action. The possibility of abortion rights ending on Whitmer s watch had been a subject of conversation among her and her advisers ever since 2018. according to several aides. when it came up as a possible topic in debate prep. It also came up in her meetings with abortion rights groups. in a way that made officials take notice of her interest and commitment.  She wasn t just pantomiming it like a lot of politicians do.  Ilyse Hogue. who at the time was president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. told me.  She really seemed to understand and internalize that this was real. that it would be her responsibility. Hogue said that Whitmer had already  done her homework  by thinking through some of the levers a governor would have to protect abortion in a state with a decadesold ban on the books that conservative prosecutors could suddenly try to enforce if Roe fell. That possibility became a lot more real in late 2020. when Amy Coney Barrett took Ruth Bader Ginsburg s place on the court. and then in early 2021. when the justices announced that they would hear Dobbs. It was during that period. aides say. serious discussions over gubernatorial action began.One outcome of those discussions was a decision to file that preemptive lawsuit. blocking county prosecutors from enforcing the 1931 ban. That decision paid off in the weeks following Dobbs. when conservative prosecutors in two Michigan counties ― one around Grand Rapids. one around Jackson ― said they were ready to bring cases under the law. They never got the chance because a judge. ruling on Whitmer s lawsuit. issued an injunction against enforcement until there s a definitive ruling on how the 1931 law squares with existing privacy protections in Michigan s Constitution.The long-term future of abortion rights in Michigan will depend heavily on the outcome of the upcoming elections. A constitutional amendment on the ballot would make protection of abortion rights explicit. though its exact meaning would be subject to debate by lawmakers and interpretation by the state Supreme Court. If it fails. then the cases now in litigation will go to the court. giving it a chance to rule on whether the constitution as currently written permits a ban. It s impossible to know how the court would rule or when. and who would be on it at that time. (Michigan s Supreme Court justices are elected.)Dixon has said that her position on abortion doesn t matter. because voters will decide the issue when they vote on the amendment. But while a clear majority of Michiganders oppose abortion bans. as polls have shown consistently. the amendment s popularity has been falling in the face of a relentless campaign supported by the Catholic Church and full of disinformation. like claims that it would allow minors to get gender reassignment surgery without a parent s permission. If the amendment fails and Dixon wins. she d be in a position to enforce the law. even if that s not what most residents want.It was during a debate about an abortion-related bill in 2013 that Whitmer revealed for the first time publicly that she had been a rape victim in college. The speech went viral. and Whitmer says she learned from that.  Like many women. I kept it to myself and I kind of tried to bury it.  Whitmer told me.  I had avoided talking about it for most of my life. other than with a few trusted partners that I d had in different times of my life. But I think sharing it has helped me get more comfortable and more thoughtful and empathetic. in terms of supporting women who had [had a] similar circumstance. because there s a lot of them. unfortunately. Over the past few months. she s been sharing the story a lot more ― among other places. in a series of roundtables around the state. These are not campaign-style events where Whitmer gives a speech and crowds of supporters applaud. These are invitation-only. intimate gatherings ― sometimes just five or six women sitting around a table. sharing stories while Whitmer mostly listens. Staff say they pick the guests from letters the governor or state agencies get. rather than going through advocacy groups or the Democratic Party.That may explain why many of the women present are Republicans ― or. at least. used to be.  Until June. until the Supreme Court decision. I was very much a conservative.  Krystal Carpenter. 43. told me after one such meeting. adding that she voted for Trump in 2016.  I never had to worry about my reproductive freedom. That changed real quick when Roe was overturned. I saw that my party turned its back on me. Carpenter was so angry that she wrote to every elected official she could think of — federal. state and local. Democratic and Republican. Whitmer s office was the only one who answered. Carpenter said. and soon she got an invitation to a roundtable in Lansing.  I was sitting right to her. and she just listened. she took in every word. from every woman sitting there.  Carpenter said.  She looked at me as a woman. as a mother. as a wife — and I felt respected.  At this point. there is no way to know how many people like Carpenter are out there. or whether they represent enough of a bloc to give Whitmer an electoral victory in such an otherwise difficult year for Democrats. Turnout among Black voters could fall short of expectations. as it did for Clinton in 2016. or Dixon s focus on schools could boost turnout among her supporters. Either could lead to a Whitmer loss.A Whitmer win. by contrast. would put her name more firmly into the conversation about future Democratic nominees for higher office — a possibility that came up in 2020. when the Biden campaign put her on the list of potential running mates. Her candidacy would face all kinds of questions. while her governing record would have to withstand new. more intense scrutiny. She would have to prove she could hold up in a campaign that demanded more domestic policy vision. and foreign policy chops as well.But she d have a compelling case to make. having governed in a time of crisis. then winning votes from the same sorts of voters and in the same sorts of places that Democrats need to hold. Her one-on-one skills might play particularly well in the living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire. And it s not like the political forces Whitmer is resisting in Michigan are likely to go away anytime soon. Access to abortion. the future of public schools. the stability of American democracy: all of them are going to be in play as long as MAGA acolytes are in charge of the Republican Party. The outcome of Michigan s gubernatorial race could reveal a lot about how those battles are going to play out over the next few years — and who has the tools to fight them.,Entertainment News

Ron JohnsonMilwaukee Journal Sentinel reportedThere is nothing illegal about Johnson or his family members taking the deduction available to limited liability companies and other firms that pass all of their income on to their owners or investors. Companies structured this way. often small. family-owned businesses. are not subject to corporate income tax.faces Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela BarnesDonald TrumpDemocratsU.S. SenateThe Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson s three adult children are the beneficiaries of a family trust and are listed as managers of about 10 companies registered with the state Department of Financial Institutions.Those companies and the family trust own about two dozen properties around the nation with assessed values of $21 million. the newspaper reported.In 2017. Johnson held up passage of Trump s tax bill by objecting to the plan s already generous tax break for pass-through businesses. Originally. the Trump administration proposed allowing business owners to deduct up to 17.4% of their profits. Johnson fought to increase that to 23%. The figure ended up at 20%.Several studies have found that the tax cut primarily helped the wealthy.Ross Milton. an assistant professor at La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. said the pass-through provision is  still a hotly debated topic among tax policy people.  I think these pass-through provisions have been criticized because much of the benefit of them goes to very high income and/or high wealth households.  Milton said.  And presumably the Johnson family is a high-income household. After learning of the Johnson family s extensive real estate holdings from the Journal Sentinel. Barnes campaign spokesperson Maddy McDaniel said she was not surprised.,Entertainment News

We have informed Trump s counsel that he must begin producing records no later than next week.  the statement continued.The panel added that Trump  remains under subpoena for testimony  originally scheduled for Nov. 14. That date still stands.The Oct. 21 subpoena demanded records of any communications that Trump may have had regarding extremist groups involved in the riot at the U.S. Capitol last year — and any attempts in the past year to contact witnesses testifying before the House committee.The subpoena also called for Trump to provide testimony at the Capitol or by video conference on Nov. 14.Trump s lawyers had not responded by late Friday.Trump may now view his required appearances in a number of investigations as must-delays in light of a possible upcoming announcement that he s running to become the Republican presidential candidate. which could complicate the probes.,Politics News
A man who wants to run Oklahoma s school system has pushed a claim about liberals supposedly installing litter boxes in schools to accommodate students who identify as cats. even though it s been debunked as a myth. Republican Ryan Walters  comments appeared in a video posted by The Lost Ogle. an Oklahoma blog. The site said Walters was  talking to a group of fellow right-wing voters earlier this month at a meeting in Stillwater.  I got a call over the weekend from a former colleague and he said. ‘Ryan. I m telling you right now...   Walters said. before his voice trailed off a bit.  Have you heard about the litter boxes stuff?  he then asked the audience.  This was a legitimate faculty meeting where the counselors and administrators were talking to the staff ― are you ready? ― about whether they should allow litter boxes in the bathrooms for kids that identify as cats.  he said. An unseen audience member can be heard among the audible reactions saying.  Oh my God. Walters then finished up the anecdote by returning to his former colleague s reaction. And my buddy said. ‘Hey. I m just going to tell you. I m not teaching anymore if that happens. Like. I love teaching. it s my passion. but I m out of here. Like that is such a sense of. like. nonsense. I can t pretend that that s right. I m out of here.   Walters said.The idea that school children are identifying as cats and demanding to be allowed to use cat litter instead of toilets has been debunked repeatedly as essentially an urban legend. Nonetheless. it has been repeated by several Republican candidates for office at various levels. Even podcaster Joe Rogan said he had heard the same thing. before recently taking it back.An analysis by NBC News looked at 20 of those reports. and the districts named either told the outlet or stated publicly that no such incidents had occurred. Reuters. The Associated Press and USA TodayWhile it was not clear if Walters was saying someone he knew had seen or attended such a meeting or that he had. the candidate presented it as a real thing to the audience in the video.Emails to a Walters campaign website and to his official email at his secretary of education post ― an appointed position as part of Gov. Kevin Stitt s cabinet ― were not answered.The video also left it unclear where Walters   former colleague  worked. but Walters taught for eight years at McAlester High School. according to his campaign bio. There he was a finalist for Oklahoma Teacher of the Year in 2016.Asked if McAlester had held such a meeting like that or one that could have been construed in that manner. the district superintendent. Dr. Robert Steeber. told HuffPost.  We have not.  That is not an issue at McAlester Public Schools.  he said.After narrowly winning the Republican nomination to replace current state superintendent Joy Hofmeister. Walters has been locked in a closer-than-expected fight with Democrat Jena Nelson. the 2020 Oklahoma Teacher of the Year. for the superintendent slot.While Walters  current appointed post gives him responsibility for various education-related boards and commissions. the superintendent in Oklahoma heads up the state Department of Education.The closeness of the race may be a reflection of Hofmeister s efforts to rally teachers in her race for governor. as well as concerns by some about Walters. who lists critical race theory and teacher salaries as issues on his website. but also features abortion. gun rights and immigration.Walters is by no means the first Republican candidate to make the false claim about cat litter ― Don Bolduc. the GOP candidate for Senate in New Hampshire. also made the claim ― but he may be one of the first candidates running for a statewide education-related office to do so. At McAlester. he taught Advanced Placement classes in world history. U.S. history and U.S. government. Guys.

NASHVILLE. Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee s strict abortion ban does not apply to the disposal of fertilized human embryos that haven t been transferred to a uterus. according to a recent state attorney general opinion.The determination is among the first issued by an attorney general that provides insight on how laws heavily restricting abortion affect those seeking in vitro fertilization. or IVF. since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Disposing of an embryo that was created outside a woman s body and that has never been transferred to a woman s body thus does not qualify as ‘abortion.   Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in his opinion.The two-page document was quietly published on the attorney general s website on Oct. 20 at the request of Tennessee s Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson. a Republican currently seeking reelection.Tennessee s lawtrigger law While I felt that the law was clear and that it did not apply to this particular case and others like it. I was more than happy to ask the Attorney General for his opinion to clear up any perceived misunderstandings in the law and was pleased that the Attorney General arrived at the same conclusion.  Johnson said.While Skrmetti s opinion clarifies the disposal of unused embryos. it remains unclear if the law applies to the selective reduction process sometimes used to remove a fetus from a woman s womb if fertility treatments result in multiple pregnancies.A spokesperson for the attorney general s office did not immediately respond to comment Friday.Earlier this year. a Tennessee woman went viral after publishing a video detailing an emailed back-and-forth conversation with Republican state Rep. Ryan Williams over the disposal of human embryos.Williams initially wrote that  life does begin at conception either in the womb or in the IVF clinic.  and that doctors who discard those embryos would be a violation of state law — a punishment that carries a felony conviction and $10.000 fine.Williams told The Associated Press he has since met with several attorneys and now says his interpretation of the law was incorrect.He provided an email showing that he emailed the woman back to  extend his sincerest apologies  surrounding his original response.,Politics News
DURHAM. N.H. – Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Friday said Democrats should deal with the  debt ceiling  in the upcoming lame-duck session of Congress. removing the threat of an economic armageddon for the rest of President Joe Biden s term. We need to act during the lame duck. We cannot let the Republicans take our economy hostage and use it as leverage to take away Social Security and voting rights from people.  Warren told HuffPost at a campaign event for Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) in Durham. New Hampshire.Federal law bars the government from borrowing more than a certain amount of money. forcing lawmakers to periodically raise or suspend the  debt ceiling  to prevent a federal debt default. which could cause a financial crisis and economic chaos.The next debt ceiling deadline will come sometime next year. though the precise date is uncertain because incoming tax revenue can be unpredictable month to month.But one thing is certain: If Republicans retake the House of Representatives. they will refuse to support a debt ceiling increase without extracting major policy concessions from Democrats.Republicans haven t said what they want. but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has made it clear they want something. Some GOP lawmakers have suggested they ought to demand cuts to Social Security and Medicare benefits.When Donald Trump was president. Congress raised the debt ceiling three times. Democrats did not demand concessions. But Trump has been encouraging Republicans to use the debt limit as ruthlessly as possible.Several others in the Democratic caucus have said they shouldn t leave the debt ceiling to next year and let Republicans take the world economy hostage. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said this week that dealing with the debt limit before new lawmakers take office in January would be  a wise course of action. Separately. a group of House Democrats said in a letter to party leaders this week that Congress should pass a permanent debt ceiling solution before next year. One option would be to simply repeal the limit. another would give the Treasury Department unilateral authority to deal with it.But dealing with the debt limit in the  lame duck  session of Congress would require either 10 Senate Republicans to go along or Democrats to use a time-consuming reconciliation process. which could interfere with priority legislation such as bills protecting same-sex marriage and changing the way Congress certifies elections. Ten willing Republicans would be hard to find. and Democrats seemingly did not agree among themselves when they had the opportunity to use reconciliation last year.Another obstacle: President Joe Biden. who has said he opposes getting rid of the debt ceiling.  That would be irresponsible.  he said last month.,Politics News
Franklin. N.H. — Things are getting prickly in the Granite State.Republican Don Bolduc. a retired Army general who has espoused conspiracy theories about vaccines. the 2020 presidential election and cat litter boxes in schools. of all things. is threatening to pull off a major upset against incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) that could hand the GOP a key victory in the battle for Senate control. The momentum is ours.  Bolduc proclaimed at a campaign stop on Thursday after polls showed him gaining on Hassan. who is facing inflation-driven political headwinds. A surprise GOP win here would serve as an early bellwether for races across the country before votes are even counted in larger battleground states like Pennsylvania. Georgia. and Nevada.Democrats are taking nothing for granted in the final stretch before Election Day. Hassan is tag-teaming appearances with fellow New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and has enlisted progressive star power from neighboring Massachusetts in the form of Elizabeth Warren to energize young people. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are scheduled to make stops this weekend. Hassan got a handle on the thorny issues of the day with Shaheen at a store that sells hedgehogs and hedgehog accessories on Thursday in downtown Franklin. a small town striving to recover in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The owner proudly dubbed it  the only hedgehog store in the country.  a claim that was crying out for a senatorial inspection. Taking delicate care to avoid its sharp quills. Hassan cradled an adorable black-and-white hedgehog in her hands and talked up her bipartisan bona fides as well as the federal spending she s helped steer for businesses and new infrastructure in New Hampshire.  We ve worked to get some federal funds here that s kind of like the seed money that then helps projects come together.  she told a customer who recognized her.The woman thanked Hassan for stopping by before noting she was a Republican who saw the senator s ads on television. Democrats have blanketed the airwaves with attacks against Bolduc over abortion. his election denial and the future of Social Security. He s been vastly outspent. relying on outside groups to help him in the final days of the race I m sorry about that.  Hassan responded. referring to the TV onslaught.  Hopefully that will be over soon.  Shaheen added as the two senators headed out the door to continue their tour of the town.The woman later identified herself as Judy Walsh. and said she recently moved to Hopkinton. New Hampshire. from California. She wasn t convinced by Hassan s pitch. telling HuffPost she is planning to vote for Bolduc on Tuesday.  Basically. I just always vote pro-life.  Walsh explained.The somewhat thorny exchange follows months of Democratic ads over the issue of abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court s repeal of Roe v. Wade. In New Hampshire. reproductive rights are popular and abortion is legal up to 24 weeks. Bolduc has been careful not to back a national abortion ban like some other GOP Senate candidates. while Hassan has argued that he can t be trusted on the issue because of several comments he made opposing abortion. He has been trying to cover up his extreme record. but at the end of the day Granite Staters are sophisticated. informed voters and they know dishonesty when they see it.  Hassan said Friday at a campaign rally in Durham. But the elevated enthusiasm for Republican candidates across the country has led to last-minute fretting within the Democratic Party about their strategy of focusing on issues like abortion and the future of democracy instead getting more aggressive on the economy. which has risen to the top of voters  minds.  While the abortion issue must remain on the front burner. it would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of the economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote recently.For Bolduc. the central issue of the campaign boils down to  heating and eating.  a frequent refrain in his stump speech that refers to the cost of heating oil and food ahead of the coming winter. It s a potent economic argument amid stubborn inflation eating into worker paychecks this year. and one Republicans are hoping will carry them to majorities in both houses of Congress. But the GOP candidate veered way off track in the past week by playing up a false anti-trans. right-wing trope about students at schools using litter boxes and licking one another as part of a subculture known as  furries.  This fit into his broader theme on the campaign trail railing against public education and complaining about lessons on critical race theory and gender.  Get this. get this — they re putting litter boxes. litter boxes.  he said at an event last week. per audio posted by CNN.  I honestly wish this wasn t real. a ‘Saturday Night Live  skit ... that was fictional. but it s not. Although the New Hampshire school he where he claimed this was happening has denied the story. Bolduc hasn t backed down. Asked Thursday by HuffPost if he made any efforts to personally verify his talking point. Bolduc dodged. In the course of talking to people at town halls. different subjects come up. That s all that is.  he said.  Our education system is broken. not this other stuff. What s going on in our classrooms is wrong. It s inappropriate. The anti-LGBTQ rhetoric is resonating with Bolduc s supporters.  I m a woman. You re a man. Why do they have a problem saying ‘woman  and ‘man ?  said Patricia Laforme. a retired accountant from Loudon. New Hampshire.  When it comes to Olympics in sports you have the women and the men. Meanwhile. Hassan criticized Bolduc for spreading  a really harmful conspiracy theory  in an interview with HuffPost. comparing it to his earlier election denialism. In addition to echoing Trump s lies about the 2020 election during the GOP primary. Bolduc has backed the elimination of the FBI and the Department of Education. He even called New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu a  Chinese Communist sympathizer.  The two have patched things up since. and Sununu s popularity at the top of the ticket could now carry Bolduc to victory. Hassan was first elected to the Senate in 2016 after beating GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte in an election decided by just over 1.000 votes. During her time in office. she has kept a low-profile. voting largely in lockstep with her fellow Democrats and President Joe Biden. She has sought to put some distance between herself and Biden in the closing weeks of the race. highlighting her criticism of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. an issue that resonates in the veteran-heavy state. and calls for more border security. While Hassan maintains that Biden is welcome to campaign in New Hampshire. he has stayed away — likely because his low approval rating would do more harm than good. At the University of New Hampshire. Hassan let Warren give the closing speech in an auditorium full of college students. the kind of voters Democrats are desperately trying to get to the polls on Tuesday. She warned the crowd that losing the seat would mean making Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) majority leader again. paving the way for a national abortion ban and more tax cuts for the wealthy.  There is so much on the line.  Warren said.  When there is this much at stake. we can whimper. we can cringe. we can whine. or we can fight back. Me? I m fighting back. ,Politics News

Democrats have focused too much on abortion as they make their final midterm pitch ― at least. that s what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). of all people. recently argued. Instead. he said. politicians need to be focusing on the economy. Democrats shouldn t focus only on abortion in the midterms. That s a mistake.  Sanders wrote in an op-ed for The Guardian last month.  America has long faced structural economic crises. Democrats must win on the economy and present a pro-worker agenda.  Yes. the economy is critically important. And yes. abortion shouldn t be the only focus of any politician. But thinking of these as two separate issues is a mistake ― one that many politicians and talking heads are making right now. Framing abortion as a culture war issue. separate from bread-and-butter economics. erases the very real experiences of tens of millions of women and people with the capacity for pregnancy in the United States. It s been said before. but it bears repeating: The right to bodily autonomy is inextricably linked to economic concerns. Multiple studies have shown that being denied an abortion leads to increased rates of poverty and debt. a decrease in employment that lasts for years. a higher likelihood of eviction or foreclosure. and years spent trying to raise a child without enough money for basic necessities like food. housing and transportation.And 75% of women who seek abortion care are already low-income. which means the people who are denied abortions will only be thrust further into poverty. according to a 2014 study from the Guttmacher Institute. a science-based research group that supports abortion rights. For the people who are affected. it s a huge economic issue.  said Dr. Diana Greene Foster. author and head researcher of the Turnaway Study. which followed 1.000 women over 10 years and analyzed the long-term effects of being able to access an abortion versus being denied an abortion. Taking away access to an abortion means people have kids before they have the resources to do it. and then are less likely to have children later under better circumstances.  Foster said.  It s not even pro-child. The result of this is to raise more kids in economic hardship.  There can even be serious economic consequences for people who are able to obtain abortions in the current landscape. There s a patchwork of states that still offer access to abortion. meaning many people seeking care now have to travel long distances to get it. That may mean paying for gas. food and lodging. as well as taking unpaid time off from work and finding child care for their other children. People may need time to save up for these expenses. which would mean they re seeking care later in their pregnancy. when abortions are often more costly.But let s go back to Sanders  pro-worker agenda. If voters are unbothered by how abortion restrictions affect individual women and families  economic circumstances. let s look at how these bans affect the economy as a whole. Abortion restrictions subtract $105 billion a year from the economy  by reducing women s labor force participation and earnings and increasing turnover and time off from work among women ages 15 to 44 years.  according to a 2021 study by the Institute for Women s Policy Research. Access to abortion care is critical for women to have control over their economic security. including future educational and career opportunities. Being able to access an abortion increased women s probability of graduating college by 72%. according to an analysis of data from 1960 to 1992. There s also research to suggest that women who are able to delay motherhood by a year thanks to legal abortion access end up earning 11% higher wages on average.Earlier this year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen laid out the economic costs for women and the country if federal abortion protections were to fall.  Eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.  Yellen said during a May congressional hearing after a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion revealed the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Roe v. Wade and access to reproductive health care. including abortion. helped lead to increased labor force participation and enabled many women to finish school. That increased their earning potential. It allowed women to plan and balance their families and careers.  she said.  And research also shows that it has a favorable impact on the well-being and earnings of children. Research further indicates that abortion bans will result in more women dying. If abortion is banned throughout the U.S.. which some Republicans are trying to make happen. it s believed maternal deaths would rise by an estimated 24%. That number is even higher for Black mothers. whose maternal mortality would rise by 39%. An agenda that is  pro-worker  needs workers. and it needs to care about them. If millions of people drop out of the workforce to care for children they did not economically plan for. or if more women are dying due to forced pregnancy and childbirth. it will undoubtedly lead to dire economic consequences ― on top of the calamitous human costs.,Politics News
DemocratsDonald Trumpleaksnews outletsRepublicans If there is one thing Trump has proved over and over again. there is only one person he cares about electing. and that s him.  said Rory Cooper. a Republican consultant and aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.Cooper pointed out that not only did the GOP lose the House under Trump in 2018. but it then lost the Senate when Trump sabotaged two Georgia runoffs in January 2021 by telling his supporters that the elections were rigged.  Not only has he not helped Republicans win majorities. but he actively cost us the Senate two years ago with these antics. and so we have him to thank for Biden s entire legislative agenda to date.  Cooper said.Trump s staff did not respond to queries from HuffPost about his 2024 plans.One close Trump confidant. who spoke on condition of anonymity. said he is not convinced Trump will actually announce this month but that many top advisers. including the head of his political operation. Susie Wiles. are pushing him in that direction.  Not sure it means he is a candidate six months from now.  the confidant said. adding that Wiles and others are hoping to head off a presidential run by Republican Ron DeSantis. who is expected to win a second term as Florida governor on Tuesday.Wiles was banished from DeSantis  orbit three years ago after memos detailing his fundraising plan and price list were leaked to the media and DeSantis assumed she was involved. The Trump confidant said a DeSantis presidency would effectively end her career.Wiles did not respond to HuffPost s queries.For the past year. Trump has claimed that prosecutors were only targeting him because they want to prevent him from becoming president again. and any decision to run should be seen in that context. other Republicans said. This is probably as much about making it tougher on DOJ to proceed if he s an active candidate than it is about anything else.  said one senior GOP consultant on condition of anonymity.  I honestly don t think he s too worried about potential rivals. But David Jolly. a former GOP congressman from Tampa. said Trump seems fixated on a potential DeSantis candidacy.  It s 100% about DeSantis. He has to go first. otherwise DeSantis gets to set the field. If Trump goes first. it forces DeSantis to do something he has never. ever done: directly challenge the former president.  Jolly said. adding that he would be surprised if Trump can manage to wait a full week after the midterms. I ve long suspected Trump calls into Fox News on election night and declares then. He d own the night.  Jolly said.  This clips DeSantis. It then begs the question: How much confidence does DeSantis really have. Will he challenge the old man? DeSantis  campaign did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. During his sole debate with Democratic challenger Charlie Crist. though. DeSantis declined to pledge to serve out his second term if reelected.Trump is under investigation by the Department of Justice for his role in Jan. 6. including the scheme to submit to the National Archives fraudulent slates of electors from states that voted for Democrat Joe Biden as a way to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to award Trump a second term. A separate probe is investigating Trump s removal of highly classified documents from the White House and subsequent refusal to hand them over. even in defiance of a subpoena.In addition to the federal criminal investigations. a Georgia prosecutor is looking at Trump and his allies  attempts to coerce state officials into falsely declaring him the winner in that state.Trump. despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College. became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― led to the deaths of five people. including one police officer. the injury of 140 officers and four police suicides.At rallies and in statements on his personal social media platform. Trump has continued to lie about the election and the Jan. 6 House select committee s work. calling it a  hoax  similar to previous investigations into his 2016 campaign s acceptance of Russian assistance and his attempted extortion of Ukraine into helping his 2020 campaign.,Politics News

Donald Trumpa federal trialThe jury deliberated three days before finding Barrack not guilty of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. obstruction of justice and making false statements. Barrack had vehemently denied the charges.Barrack. 75. is an old friend of Trump and is a California billionaire who chaired Trump s inaugural committee. He was among of a long line of Trump associates to face various criminal charges.In closing argumentsThe prosecutor pointed to what he characterized as a steady steam of shady texts and other communications that showed that Barrack was under the direction and control of Rashid al Malik. a businessperson from the UAE who acted as a conduit to the rulers the oil-rich Persian Gulf state.Barrack  marketed himself as politically connected. Someone who could open doors for the UAE. Someone who could offer access to Donald Trump. ... He was going to be their man on the inside.  Harris said.Al Malik asked Barrack  to do things for the UAE again and again.  he said.Defense attorney Randall Jackson said Barrack made no attempt to conceal his relationships with Al Malik. someone in a network of business connections he had cultivated throughout the Middle East. He also said it  makes no sense  that his client would try to infiltrate the Trump campaign on the behalf of the UAE at a time when Trump s chances of winning the presidency were considered a longshot. He was involved in the campaign because he s loyal to his friends — maybe to a fault.  the lawyer said.Barrack testifiedAsked why. he responded.  I never did anything wrong. Barrack. an Arabic speaker of Lebanese descent. also described efforts to arrange for Trump to meet with UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other officials from more moderate governments in an effort to persuade Trump to tone down his his anti-Muslim rhetoric.

PENNSYLVANIA — LifeGate Church is nestled in a wooded area of Elizabethtown. 6 miles from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant that partially melted down in 1979. almost rendering this pretty patch of central Pennsylvania along the Susquehanna River a radioactive wasteland. The church was formed in 2010. and now a half-acre of trees behind the building lay on their sides. cut down to make room for an expansion that will include a new youth center. On an overcast Sunday morning last month. about 80 congregants pulled into the parking lot underneath brilliant orange and yellow foliage and filed in through the church s red front doors. sharing warm greetings and smiles. I also pulled into the parking lot. glancing in the rearview mirror to see a car pulling in behind me with a sticker on its front windshield declaring.  CRT MARXISM SUCKS.  I was welcomed by Pastor Don Lamb. a tall. gray-mustachioed man who had recently recovered from a heart attack. (He d collapsed in a nearby diner and technically died. he told me. But people rushed to his aid and performed a  miracle.  resuscitating him.) Lamb had made it clear before I arrived at LifeGate that he was wary of journalists like me. but that the church would stand by its promise to welcome anybody for Sunday service. I took my place in the rows of adjoined chairs as a full band — keyboardist. guitar player. bass player. drummer — started to play worship songs. The congregants rose to their feet. some with palms facing upward and eyes closed. singing. Lamb then introduced a visitor to the day s service. Calvin Greiner. a middle-aged white man from over in Lititz who claims to receive prophetic visions from God. Greiner walked to the front of the room carrying a long sword and grabbed hold of the microphone.  I was instructed years and years ago to make a sword and to put on it specific words.  Greiner said. He recited the sword s inscription.  Anointed and appointed. Worship. Warfare. Prayer. Intercession by the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ.  he said.  The other side says. The sword of the Lord — my name s not on here — it s The sword of the Lord. The sword of the Spirit.   This was in the office of Doug Mastriano — some of you might know him — for 225 days.  Greiner continued. Mastriano. of course. is a state senator and Republican nominee for governor of Pennsylvania. Greiner explained how God recently told him to retrieve the sword from Mastriano s office in Harrisburg. take it to Philadelphia. where a pastor at a church blessed it. and then to the nation s capital.  God said. ‘After Philly. this must go to D.C. This must go to my Capitol in D.C. from Harrisburg.   Greiner recalled. his voice breaking. But before D.C.. God told him to stop at LifeGate. where he d meet a man named Jim Emery. a church member who had worked as security for Mastriano during his campaign.Greiner invited Emery and a couple of other men to join him at the front of the church. where they laid their hands upon the sword and began to pray as the guitarist strummed a soft melody.  Oh Lord and heavenly father. we thank you and pray to you that you gave us this sword to bind the powers of Satan and cast it out!  one of the men said.  As this sword moves to Washington. I pray by the powers of the Holy Spirit you will send your angels in and around that building. Lord. And you will touch the mighty Angel of God and find the power of Satan in Washington and run him out of town. Lord!  The guitarist continued playing as Greiner closed the prayers by exclaiming:  So let God arise! Let his enemies scatter! Let those who hate God flee right now!  Lamb took hold of the microphone again.  We welcome you all to LifeGate. the church in the country that s trying to affect the country.  he said.  We truly believe that God has called the church to be more than a house of offerings. a house of sermons. a house of hymnals. This will be a house of activating people to be engaged in the world we will live in.  Lamb asked the congregation:  How many of you look forward to the return of Christ?  The crowd erupted into cheers and amens. That s coming.  Lamb assured them.  but you got work to do until then.  In April. Mastriano spoke at an event in Gettysburg hosted by believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory. He told the crowd that he would be the next governor of Pennsylvania because  my God will make it so.  The event s organizer. Francine Fosdick. then gave him what she called  the Sword of David.  She explained that she was giving him the sword because of the  warfare  Mastriano would have to wage on the campaign trail.  You ve been fighting for our country. and you re fighting for our religious rights in Christ Jesus.  Fosdick told him. Oh yeah.  Mastriano replied. holding up the blade.  Where s Goliath? Mastriano s campaign did not answer any questions for this story. including whether this sword was the same one I saw at LifeGate. Mastriano has run an insular campaign for governor. often outright refusing to engage questions from a mainstream media eager to press him about his apocalyptic Christian worldview. He has preferred instead to remain in a conservative media bubble. almost solely granting interviews to far-right figures like Steve Bannon. To better understand Mastriano. I traveled to central Pennsylvania to see the Christian nationalist extremists in his orbit up close. His supporters. some of whom are self-anointed  prophets.  see Mastriano as ordained by God to be governor of the Keystone State at a crucial moment in American history. Along the way. I joined a traveling far-right roadshow and neo-Charismatic Christian revival called the Great ReAwakening. hosted by former Trump national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn and Oklahoma businessman Clay Clark. It s a festival of MAGA and QAnon conspiracy theories — about the 2020 election. vaccines. the COVID pandemic. 5G. critical race theory and a globalist cabal of Democratic Satan-worshiping pedophiles — so outlandish that it d be easy to dismiss as fringe if it weren t regularly attracting thousands of people. It s also routinely endorsed by some of the most powerful Republican figures in the country. including Mastriano.If polls. not prophecies. are to be believed. Mastriano will be clobbered by his Democratic opponent. Josh Shapiro. in Tuesday s election. But his likely defeat shouldn t distract from what Mastriano represents: The ongoing radicalization of the Republican Party into a sect that sees its victory as inevitable and predestined from above. and which paints its opponents as the literal incarnations of the Devil in need of vanquishing. In this view. democracy is merely a roadblock in a divine quest for domination. Early on a Friday morning last month in Manheim. a small town in the fertile farmland of Lancaster County. a few thousand people — almost all white. most middle-aged — entered the sprawling Spooky Nook Sports complex. laying their coats down on white folding chairs as a band on stage broke into song.  Way maker. miracle worker. promise keeper. light in the darkness. My God that is who you are.  the band sang as the crowd joined in. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with slogans like  Jesus is my Savior. Trump is my President.  and  FAUCI LIED.  Pastor Dave Scarlett took the stage. flanked by half a dozen people holding shofars — rams-horn trumpets traditionally used by Jews in religious ceremonies. In recent years the far-right has appropriated the instrument for its battle cry. a way of commencing  spiritual warfare.  Shofars were seen frequently during the violent Jan. 6. 2021. attack on the U.S. Capitol.  Let s go to war.  Scarlett told the crowd. the shofars sounding off seven times. So began the 17th stop of the Great ReAwakening tour. Attendees were told by speaker after speaker that they — the true. real Americans — are under attack on all fronts. and their salvation lies in seizing political and cultural institutions to pave the way for the Second Coming of Christ.Many speakers claim they have a direct line to God. Bo Polny describes himself as an  experienced cycles timing analyst  in  Gold. Silver and Cryptocurrency  who uses  prayer and prophetic dreams  to forecast the markets.  The U.S. Stock Market Crashed 38% in March 2020. as forecast.  his website claims.  NEXT comes the OCTOBER 2022 WORLD ECONOMIC COLLAPSE followed by the return of President Trump… how will Bitcoin. Gold. Silver and Cryptocurrencies react in the turmoil? Become a PRIVATE MEMBER TODAY and get all the DETAILS!  (A 14-day trial is  only  $99.) Polny spoke at the Great ReAwakening show on Oct. 21. After a hard-to-follow explanation about the Biblical significance of the number  24.  Polny told the crowd that something big was going to happen soon. on Nov. 24 — perhaps the crash of the American dollar.  The system is a fraud. people!  Polny said.  It s a fraud. Haggai 2:8 states that ‘the silver and the gold are mine. saith the Lord.  Not the U.S. dollar!  He then added:  The seven mountains that are built — the financial system. the church. education. the government. arts. entertainment. media — all of it is coming down. and seven new mountains will be built!  The crowd — which knew this prophecy well — cheered. The  Seven Mountains Mandate  is at the core of the New Apostolic Reformation. This relatively new evangelical movement believes in miracles. the supernatural. and the existence of modern-day apostles and prophets. It s a movement characterized by Christian dominionism. the belief that Christians must gain control of the  seven mountains  of societal influence to form a perfect world. Only then. the prophecy goes. can Christ return to Earth. This theocratic philosophy makes no room for equal governance in a pluralistic society like that of the United States. Yet the GOP candidate for governor of the country s fifth largest state is a devotee. Though Mastriano has attempted to distance himself from New Apostolic Reformation. he has appeared repeatedly on the campaign trail with its apostles and prophets. allowing them to lay hands on him in prayer. Mastriano was scheduled to speak at this Great ReAwakening in Manheim — organizer Clay Clark said Mastriano s campaign asked to include him on the speaker list — but he wouldn t appear until the end of the second day of the conference. after 16-plus hours of songs. baptisms. healing ceremonies and the casting out of demons.And wild speeches like Polny s.  We re about to witness the Third Seal of Revelation.  Polny told the Great ReAwakening crowd.  The angel of death is coming to visit these people before the end of the year.  A graphic appeared on the screen behind him showing photos of Hilary Clinton. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R). MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. President Joe Biden. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). billionaire George Soros. former First Lady Michelle Obama. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. and others.  These people are going down!  Polny exclaimed as the audience cheered and clapped.  These people who think they are pharaohs! Present-day pharaohs who you shall never see again!  This is coming with the greatest wealth transfer in human history.  he continued. making sure to plug his business.  Gold and silver are going to explode in value…  Polny s hit list. which included many of the MAGA movement s stated political opponents. was taken from  Julie Green Prophecies.  according to the graphic on the projector. Green. a fixture of the Great ReAwakening tour. is a  prophet  whose prophecies are reliably pro-Trump. They are sometimes violent too. like her prophecy that God — any minute now — is going to strike down Democratic politicians  for their planned pandemic. shortages. inflation. mandates and for stealing an election.  She has also falsely alleged that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  loves to drink the little children s blood  and that the federal government is performing  human sacrifices.  She nevertheless enjoys a close relationship with Mastriano. The GOP nominee for governor once shared a video of Green prophesying that Pennsylvania is a  hornet s nest of corruption  but that  I. the Lord. am cleansing your state.  Mastriano has been photographed with Green and once invited her to give a prayer at a campaign rally. At the Patriots Arise conference in Gettysburg — where Mastriano accepted his sword — Green delivered another prophecy.  Yes. Doug. I am here for you. and I have not forsaken you.  Green said. speaking as God.  The time has come for their great fall. for the great steal to be overturned. So. keep your faith in me. I knew all this about Green when she took the stage at the Great ReAwakening in Manheim. I did not expect to witness how much her followers adored her and how excited they were to watch her reveal prophecies on stage. Says God. ‘you can t stop my son. who is the rightful president. and his name is President Donald Trump…  she said. as the crowd broke into hysterical cheers.  He is on his way back. and how he takes his position back on center stage. you will never see that coming because you won t see me coming. And I am with him.  Green said that Trump s return to the White House might happen before 2024.  God said he can take this country back in unconventional ways. He doesn t need an election to do it.  she added.Later. I saw Green wafting around the conference like a celebrity. She. at times. placed her hands on people s heads. casting out their demons. causing her followers to break down in tears and even collapse. She and other  prophets  performed these rituals frequently. They claimed to heal the sick. A woman in a wheelchair stood up and walked. saying this Great ReAwakening was the first time she d done so in 13 years. Valeri Boland. who coordinates volunteers for Mastriano s campaign in Dauphin County. told me I had a demon. I had been watching the failed U.S. Senate candidate Kathy Barnette speak on stage when Boland sat next to me. She had seen my tweets about the conference. She whispered in my ear that they were  trash  and  full of lies.  pointing her finger toward my chest. She said she would pray for me to have a  radical encounter with God  so that the  demons inside me  causing me to lie would leave. She went back to her seat. Twenty minutes later. she found me again and apologized. offering to pray with me. an invitation I declined. She was joined by Francine Fosdick. the QAnon believer from Gettysburg who had gifted Mastriano the sword. The pair both wore  Mastriano  pins on their shirts and launched into a series of conspiratorial rants that they asked me not to record — including about the COVID vaccine and the Georgia Guidestones — while trying to convince me to accept Jesus into my heart. I walked over to where various MAGA vendors were hawking their wares. There were prophetic paintings. one of Jesus hugging an American flag and another of a lion. surrounded by American flags. and the text:  What storm Mr. President? You ll find out  — an apparent reference to the QAnon  storm  prophecy that Trump will mass-arrest his political enemies one day. Other vendors sold $100 metal crosses. handbags shaped like guns. and  Trump is still my president. but Christ is King  sweatshirts. There were various questionable health supplements for sale. vitamins and anointing oils. and a blanket that purportedly protects you from 5G s radioactive waves. One woman. who had hurt her wrists working as an Amazon delivery driver. showed me the bottle of  micronic silver  she had just bought. which she claimed instantly stopped her pain. Mastriano s campaign had a booth amidst all this snake oil where supporters could sign up to volunteer. A nervous campaign worker moved aside as I took photos of the booth. stacked with literature about Mastriano s pledge to restore  voting integrity.   end mask and vaccine mandates.  and  put parents in charge of education.  I asked the campaign worker if Mastriano would still speak at the conference. and she said probably not. He was too busy. Clark. the conference organizer. kept telling me that Mastriano was still on the schedule.  I identify as a man today — is it OK to be in here?  a man in the men s bathroom loudly joked as he used a urinal. with three other grown men next to him guffawing. (Nearly every speaker at the conference had gone after transgender people. some calling gender dysphoria the work of the devil.) Outside. I found Pennsylvania state Rep. Dave Zimmerman. who I d interviewed a few weeks prior at a small rally for Mastriano in Harrisburg. At that rally. he had admitted to being subpoenaed by the FBI. likely over his involvement with Mastriano s scheme to install fake electors after the 2020 election to give the presidency to Trump. I showed Zimmerman a photo of the  angel of death  prophecy that had been projected on stage. making sure it was close enough so he could read the text above the faces of the 24 people prophesied to die in the next couple of months:  Angel of Death coming for them by year-end.  TREASON will be written on them for ETERNITY.  Is this OK? I asked Zimmerman. He demurred.  I don t know what was said. But there s no question there s. you know. there s good things. and there s bad things happening in our country. and some individuals promote good things. and some individuals promote bad things.  I asked him:  Do you believe in modern-day prophets who have a direct line to God?  You know. throughout the Old Testament. New Testament scripture. God used prophets. and I m sure he s using prophets today as well. There s clearly prophets that can talk to God. I m sure.  Zimmerman said.Outside the building. I eavesdropped as about a dozen attendees smoked cigarettes while chatting about their favorite far-right media personalities. I go to sleep listening to InfoWars.   That BS with the Sandy Hook lawsuit fucked him over.   We were listening to Ben Shapiro on local radio — he talks too fast. though.   Tucker Carlson — he is so funny sometimes. He just cracks me up. And that laugh of his! Lisa. from Elizabethtown. lit a second cigarette after agreeing to explain her  Save The Children  T-shirt to me. The Illuminati. she said. are harvesting adrenochrome from the blood of sex-trafficked kids in underground tunnels. She d seen video evidence of these rituals via DuckDuckGo — a Pennsylvania-based search engine. She turned around so I could see the back of her shirt. replete with a map of  THE TUNNEL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES. This conspiracy theory is at the heart of QAnon. the authoritarian fantasy that one day Trump will destroy this cabal of pedophiles. who incidentally are his political foes. Support for QAnon was evident at the Great ReAwakening — with one speaker leading the crowd in reciting the movement s slogan.  Where we go one. we go all.  But it was far less pronounced than it might ve been at a MAGA event two or three years ago. I called Thomas LeCaque. an associate professor of history at Grand View University who studies apocalyptic religion and political violence. to ask him whether this was because QAnon s brand. with all of its wild prophecies and numerologies. and its association with the Jan. 6 insurrection. had simply become too toxic.  I think it s much worse than that.  he said.  I think QAnon became so normalized in the far right that you don t need the specific banners of Q to announce it s already there. When you peel away all the  genuinely batshit crazy prophetic aspects.  LeCaque explained. QAnon at its core is a  mass murder fantasy  about the coming  storm  when all of the MAGA movement s enemies will be arrested and lynched.  The ideology that your enemies are literal monsters and that something needs to be done about them — that part has unfortunately become far too mainstream.  LeCaque said.  I think that s the part that should worry us a lot more. Like it s really easy to make fun of QAnon in its purest state. but QAnon s actual core is that you need mass murder to save America. and that part hasn t died.  Inside the conference. there was excitement about the arrival of Trump s adult son.  Does anybody in this room not think that we won Pennsylvania?  Eric Trump asked the crowd after taking the stage.  It was the biggest fraud.  He then gave a speech similar to the ones he s given at other ReAwaken tour stops — the election was stolen. Christianity is under attack. liberals are indoctrinating your kids in schools — before taking out his phone and calling his dad. Eric Trump held the phone to the microphone so the crowd. growing ecstatic. could hear the former president say.  We love you. We re going to bring this country back because I think our country has never been in such bad shape as it is now. The crowd started to chant:  Trump! Trump! Trump!  Then Eric Trump thanked Clark. the conference s organizer. who had joined him on stage.  I love you guys.  he told Clark.  the job you ve done…  The crowd started to cheer loudly for Clark. I was close enough to the stage to see the tears welling up in Clark s eyes. Clark is a far-right podcaster and business consultant from Tulsa. Oklahoma. who believes that a 2013 prophecy from a self-anointed Christian  prophet  named Kim Clement about  a man by the name of Mr. Clark and… another man by the name of Donald  was about him and Trump. He interpreted this prophecy as a call from God to launch the Great ReAwakening. holding the show s first iteration in Tulsa last April. He has used the tour to push the unhinged conspiracy theory that the COVID vaccine is a trick by billionaire Bill Gates to alter our DNA. making the number of genes a variant of the devil s number — 666. also known as the  Mark of the Beast.   The shot. the injection. the bioweapon. what is being called the vaccine —everyone needs to look this up — it s called SM-102.  Clark said.  A core ingredient of the shot. SM-102. also contains a technology called luciferase—Lucifer race. Now. here he was being thanked by Eric Trump in front of thousands of people.  He doesn t need to be doing this crap. and neither do I. frankly.  Eric Trump said of Clark.  But the guy doesn t stop because he loves this nation. and he loves everything this country stands for. And you are incredible at everything you put together.  After Eric s speech. many in the crowd started to filter out of the Spooky Nook complex. walking back to their cars as the sun set. A middle-aged white couple named Carl and Lori were driving a red. white and blue pickup truck covered in decals spelling out.  Doug Mastriano For Governor.  He s gonna do all he s gonna say he s gonna do.  Carl said of Mastriano.  No same-sex marriage. no killing babies. that s the main thing. and taking care of the schools and not having teachers teaching what they re teaching. All this transgender goings-ons and all that crap.  Carl loved all the speakers at Great ReAwakening. Lori particularly liked the prophet Julie Green.  She s a very good. strong Christian woman.  Lori said.  God speaks to her.  On day two of the Great ReAwakening. I met Micki Witthoeft. the mother of Ashli Babbitt. the woman fatally shot by Capitol police as she tried to crawl through a shattered window into the Speaker s Lobby during the insurrection. Witthoeft carried a small. 19-year-old dog named Fuggles in a backpack as she walked around the conference. She wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the letters  J4J6  — Justice For Jan. 6 — next to a photo of her daughter outside the Capitol building.  That s my daughter an hour before she was murdered by the United States government.  Witthoeft said. This was her fourth time at a Great ReAwakening event. She was here with Randy Ireland. who led the New York chapter of the Proud Boys. a violent neo-fascist gang that played a major role in the insurrection. She and Ireland had joined forces to raise awareness about the mistreatment of Jan. 6 prisoners. who they said were being  robbed  of their due rights under the Constitution. Every month they host a candlelight vigil outside the prison in D.C. where a few dozen alleged insurrectionists are being detained.  We pray.  Witthoeft said.  We sing hymns. We have call-ins from the prisoners that we put out over livestream through a microphone and the telephone. and then at nine o clock. we all sing the National Anthem.  I asked her how she felt about the Great ReAwakening.  I think there s a lot of different people here with a lot of different messages. but one consistent message is we need God in this country. We need God in our lives. We need God to move us forward in our paths. individually and collectively. And so I believe. you know. it s a feel-good moment for a lot of people that are here.  Nearby people lined up to be healed by prophets. to have their demons cast out. Over on the main stage. a murderer s row of bigots. grifters. COVID-deniers. and QAnon influencers gave speeches. It became clear that Mastriano wasn t going to show. He was speaking at a rally up in Scranton and likely wouldn t have time to get here. Not that he was going to sway any voters here. anyway. He had their votes. His campaign workers packed up their booth and walked out of Spooky Nook. In his scheduled time slot. Donné Clement Petruska. the daughter of the late  prophet  Kim Clement. took to the stage and played videos of her dad  prophesying  Sept. 11. the rise of ISIS. and the election of Trump. The crowd oohed and aahed. The next morning at LifeGate church in Elizabethtown. Pastor Pete Ogilvie used part of his sermon to talk about the Great ReAwakening conference.  It was like drinking water from a firehose. the release of all the information and things — I couldn t take it all in.  he said.  It was a disturbing conference.  he said.  It was lovely and disturbing all at once.  I had come to LifeGate because of its close ties to Mastriano and its involvement with the GOP. Lancaster Online. the local newspaper. had reported that four LifeGate members. including one with direct ties to an armed militia. had been working as a security team for Mastriano on the campaign trail. One of them. Jim Emery. along with two other LifeGate members — Stephen and Danielle Lindemuth. who were at the Jan. 6 rally that turned into the insurrection — also won seats on the local school board. The church was making real inroads into local politics. I noticed Emery sitting in the back of the church during the sermon. holding the sword that had recently been in Mastriano s Harrisburg office. Emery raised the sword aloft when he felt moved by the pastor s words.  These are the things that we come against in the name of Jesus. that we wage war with. and these are the things that we will declare victory over today!  Ogilvie declared. On the wall behind him. a projector displayed a long list of the church s enemies: Mail-in Ballots. Dominion Machines. Election Day lasting longer than a week. Stolen elections. An illegitimate Administration in the WH….Human-Trafficking. Fentynol flooding our country. opioid addiction rampant. sexual immorality being the standard. Greed. Satanic Worship… Doctrines of demons. Critical Race Theory in our schools. Porn in our libraries. Boys competing in girl s sports. pronoun protocols. Liberal media lies and canceling the conservative voices… Ogilive clicked through to the next slide:  Medical Tyranny. Mask mandates. Vaccination Mandates. Covid Testing… Clause Schwab. George Soros. Fauci. Bill Gates. Hunter Biden. Nancy Pelosi. Chuck Schumer. Tom Wolf. Richard Levine. Gerry Nadler. the Jan. 6 Committee. Liz Cheney. The rest of the swamp in Both Parties. and Both Houses of Congress and the Senate…. Then he began to pray.  Lord. we believe that all these enemies of Your Word will fall. all your enemies will cower.  Ogilive said. Someone in the back of the church blew through a shofar.  Lord. we thank you. we only have enemies because you have enemies.  he added.  All your enemies are under your feet. and therefore they re under ours.  ,Politics News

OKMULGEE. Okla. — In a year when Republicans are buoyed by historical trends and poised to possibly retake control of Congress. Democrats are seeing a bright spot in an unlikely place: the governor s race in deep red Oklahoma. Kevin Stitt. the hard-nosed Republican incumbent. is beset by a series of scandals and facing a tough challenge from the state s school superintendent. a Republican-turned-Democrat named Joy Hofmeister. It s a real contest.  said Pat McFerron. a veteran Republican pollster in the state.In a state where Donald Trump took 65% of the vote and won all 77 counties. Stitt has had to get last-minute help from the Republican Governors Association. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R). He has also loaned his campaign $1.9 million of his own money.In contrast. Hofmeister received an unprecedented joint endorsement from the five biggest tribal nations of the state s 39 federally recognized tribes. seen poll numbers that show her  aggressively moderate  message may be working and nabbed the endorsement of former congressman and Oklahoma Sooner football star J.C. Watts. a Republican.She has also harnessed the energy and money of two key constituencies that have long had Stitt in their sights: many of the state s Native American tribes and the state s teachers. I want to see action that leads to the best optimal results. and you have to have collaborative leadership to get that done. And this governor is incapable.  Hofmeister told HuffPost. I m a bridge builder. He s a bridge burner. Polling on the race has been erratic. showing either big Stitt leads or narrow Hofmeister advantages. The most recent reputable poll. by Emerson College. put Stitt up 52% to 43%. Another poll. released Wednesday by an Oklahoma City TV station. though. showed Stitt with only a 1-point lead. within the margin of error.McFerron pointed to Stitt s personal loan as proof of the race s competitiveness. I don t think you have somebody. an incumbent governor. reaching into his own pocket if it s not a legitimate concern about the outcome.  he said.Hofmeister has portrayed herself as a reluctant warrior. switching parties only after Stitt had  hijacked  the Republican Party and. she said. became too divisive politically.At the top of that list is education. Stitt s support of a school voucher bill in 2021 that the state s biggest teachers union said would mean the closure of many rural schools. combined with Hofmeister s background in elementary education. made Hofmeister the obvious pick for teachers.To help deal with the voucher plan backlash. Stitt posted a video to Twitter Oct. 27 extolling his support for rural schools. Let me be clear — I will do nothing to harm our rural communities. our rural schools and our way of life.  Stitt said directly to the camera in the video.  I will stand for our way of life. our rural communities. like I ve done for the last four years. With almost 4 million people. Oklahoma has 509 separate school districts. each with its own cadre of teachers. administrators and support staff. And. according to the head of the state s biggest teachers union. they cannot wait to vote against Stitt. Our two candidates are starkly different.  said Katherine Bishop. president of the 18.000-member Oklahoma Education Association. We have one that is a champion for public schools and wants to make sure that we are doing everything to make sure that the public schools are a core service and receive everything they need to have. And then you have another candidate that wants to bring in all kinds of voucher schemes to dismantle our public schools.  Despite a 2018 boost in support brought about by teachers walking out. Bishop said Oklahoma s schools were still digging out of a deep financial hole. The National Education Association ranked Oklahoma 34th in teacher salaries and 45th in per pupil spending in its most recent rankings.At a debate in Oklahoma City. Stitt said he had put more money into education than any previous governor and  I m going to stand for parents over big unions. Aside from teachers. the other major group upset with Stitt are the state s tribal nations. Stitt got off to a bad footing with them when he proposed unilaterally renegotiating the compact agreement between the state and tribes on gambling revenues to increase the state s share. Citing tribal sovereignty. the tribes took Oklahoma to court. where they ultimately won.It was the start of an ongoing series of fights. the biggest of which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2020. the court. led by Justice Neil Gorsuch. said Congress failed to dissolve the reservations of several large tribes in the state s eastern side when Oklahoma became a state in 1907 and thus they remained legally intact.The victory was seen as the biggest win for Indigenous people at the court in decades.But after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. one of the five votes for the tribes. Stitt succeeded in getting the court to reverse itself on a major portion of the so-called McGirt decision regarding state prosecution of crimes on Native lands.The leaders of the state s five biggest tribes — the Cherokee. Muscogee (Creek). Choctaw. Chickasaw and Great Seminole nations — endorsed Hofmeister on Oct. 11. It was the first time the tribes had jointly endorsed a state candidate and may mark a new. more aggressive stance by the tribal governments.McFerron said the tribes have been active in state politics for much of the state s history (the tribes  presence predates the state by almost 100 years) but they were more out front now.Stitt. whose campaign did not answer requests to be interviewed. has also suffered from a series of self-inflicted political wounds in the form of scandals that have led to accusations of corruption.They include:All of that still may not be enough to help voters get past the  D  next to Hofmeister s name on the ballot. though.  Oklahoma is very deep red. It is difficult existing as blue here.  nail salon owner Sarah Embrey-Wellinghoff. a 29-year-old independent from Okmulgee. told HuffPost.On the other hand. a victorious statewide vote in 2020 to expand Medicaid may point the way for Hofmeister. That expansion squeaked through with a margin of about 6.500 votes out of approximately 667.000 cast.It won in only seven of the state s 77 counties. but they included the most populated ones and those with big college or tribal presences. More important. the pro-expansion advocates avoided getting totally blown out in the rural counties. allowing for big margins but not so big the votes in the denser counties could not offset them.One of those rural places Hofmeister will be trying to keep Stitt s victory margin down is Okmulgee County. about 30 minutes south of Tulsa. Just 15 minutes south in Henryetta. Gwen Kearns. an 87-year-old registered nurse. said she won t be voting for Hofmeister. even as she s not fond of Stitt. She s a Democrat. Is there anything else?  she said.  I don t particularly like women in political office. being a woman. Embrey-Wellinghoff. the nail salon owner. said she won t be too disappointed if Hofmeister loses. But she said liberals like her needed to vote. The more Democrats that vote. they re going to be able to be like. ‘Wow. the tide might be shifting. people might actually be changing or something.   she said. Whereas if you just sit at home and you think red is going to win anyway. so there s nothing I can do about it. you have to still vote to show that it s closer than people — hopefully — think. ,Politics News
BOUNTIFUL. Utah ― If Mitch McConnell winds up failing to regain control of the Senate next week. it may not be because of Pennsylvania or Arizona or Georgia. but because of people like the mad-as-hell retired game warden in a purple Utah Jazz T-shirt a few miles up the interstate from Salt Lake City. It s time to get rid of Mike Lee.  the 68-year-old said. asking that his name not be used as he slid his ballot into a drop box outside the small. white brick Davis County branch library.  I m a staunch Republican. but I m sick of him. DemocratsDonald TrumpTrump s  fake elector  schemeThat distaste over the fake electors. layered atop a more general critique that Lee has accomplished little in his 12 years in office. has presented an opening for former Republican Evan McMullin to join the Senate as an independent ― where he could well hold the key vote on both legislation as well as control of the chamber itself.U.S. SenateLee won his general election by 29 points in 2010 after successfully unseating fellow Republican Bob Bennett at the state convention and won his 2016 reelection by 41 points. His campaign publicly insists it has nothing to fear and that he is leading with a double-digit margin. Carson Jorgensen. chair of the Utah Republican Party. said their polls show Lee with a steady lead of between 7 and 14 points. I truly don t think he s got a race on his hands.  Jorgensen said.Oct. 11 appearanceAnd last week. he invited former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to campaign with him in Draper. Gabbard in the past has defended both Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and is now a favorite among Trump followers.Put Utah FirstWhere the race actually stands is unclear. Utah has not hosted a competitive general election Senate race in half a century and has never had an independent candidate running with the open support of Democrats. who opted to give McMullin a clear shot by not nominating a candidate of their own.And if he wins. he will do so running a campaign that ― unlike most Democrats who have retreated to safer  kitchen table  issues ― has unabashedly made support of democracy itself the central theme. Senator Lee. that was the most egregious betrayal of our nation s constitution in its history by a U.S. senator.  McMullin chided Lee at their sole debate last month regarding Lee s attempt to help Trump overturn his election loss.  I believe it will be your legacy. Lee. like so many of Trump s current Republican supporters. started out appalled that his party was in danger of being taken over by a vulgar game show host from New York City who had a history of donating money to Democrats.At the 2016 GOP convention. in fact. Lee was among the leaders of a movement to strip Trump of the nomination by changing the party rules and allowing all the delegates to  vote their conscience  rather than abide by their state s primary or caucus results. When his attempt to persuade fellow members of the party s Rules Committee failed. Lee took the fight to the convention floor itself. urging delegates to abandon Trump and instead go with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. the delegate count runner up.That effort also failed. but Lee s opposition to Trump continued. When the  Access Hollywood  tape was leaked in which Trump bragged that his celebrity allowed him to get away with grabbing women by the genitals. Lee was among those Republicans publicly urging Trump to drop out. A month later. on Election Day. Lee made a show of voting for neither major party candidate. but for an independent: McMullin. who wound up taking a fifth of the vote in Utah and helping hold Trump to below 50% in the state.After Trump won though. Lee. like most other Republicans. quickly moved to get on his good side. In early 2020. as fellow Utahan Romney voted to convict Trump on his impeachment for extorting Ukraine. Lee sided with every other Republican senator to let him remain in office.Later that year. as Trump campaigned for reelection. Lee appeared at a rally in Arizona. where he briefly took the stage to exhort his fellow Latter Day Saints church members to support Trump. and even compared him to a hero in the Book of Mormon. To my Mormon friends. my Latter Day Saint friends. think of him as Captain Moroni.  Lee said.  He seeks not power. but to pull it down. He seeks not the praise of the world or the ‘fake news.  but he seeks the well-being and the peace of the American people. The comment offended many Mormons. who pointed out that Moroni was a selfless leader who cared more about the welfare of his people than himself ― the exact opposite of Trump. If that didn t turn every LDS against him. they haven t read the Book of Mormon.  said Doug Mortensen. 72. and a retired trial lawyer. after voting early at the Salt Lake County government center earlier this week.offered an apology of sorts If a very small handful of states were to have their legislatures appoint alternative slates of delegates. there could be a path.  Lee wrote in a text to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows that was obtained by the House committee investigating Jan. 6.That effort bothered even Republicans in Utah. who were never crazy with Trump to begin with. In 2020. Biden won a larger share of the Utah vote ― 38% ― than any Democrat going back to 1964. Sen. Lee s involvement in that whole thing ― it really is concerning.  said Edwards.  It did resonate with people. and people were deeply concerned. Tony Saint. a 49-year-old self-described independent who served 19 years in the Navy. said he will definitely vote against Lee. and that his Jan. 6 involvement was a big reason why.  Any time you try to overthrow the government … there s a lot wrong with that.  he said.If Republicans earlier this year failed to recognize the danger than an independent run by McMullin posed. they have been fully aware of that threat in the final stretch.The conservative Club for Growth and an affiliated  Crypto Freedom PAC  poured millions of dollars into ads that dovetail with Lee s own attacks on McMullin as a closet Democrat. whom Biden could count on as a certain vote for his proposals.While it is true that McMullin endorsed Biden in 2020 because he considered Trump to be a threat to the republic. his actual background is what until recently was considered mainstream Republican.McMullin. like Lee. is a member of the LDS church and a Brigham Young University graduate. He opposes abortion and favors gun rights. In interviews. he explains how he became fascinated with the CIA after watching the Robert Redford movie  Three Days of the Condor  with his family as a teen. and how as a high-schooler he dialed directory assistance to call CIA headquarters to find out how he could join.That childhood fascination wound up as a first job after Brigham Young and an overseas assignment in the clandestine service after Sept. 11 to hunt down Al Qaeda operatives. After 11 years with the CIA. he went to work as a policy staffer for the House Republican conference. but broke with the party after it nominated Trump in 2016.He worked to recruit a Republican to run for the White House as an independent to deny Trump the presidency but ultimately took on the task himself. managing to get on a dozen state ballots and winning 732.000 votes nationally ― with 244.000 of those coming from his home state. Utah. Indeed. he and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton between them combined to receive more votes than Trump. who won the state with just 45.5%.That result. nonetheless. demonstrated a path to defeat an unpopular Republican in Utah. and among McMullin s first steps after building out his own independent campaign was to persuade Democrats not to mount one of their own.One of McMullin s biggest allies on that front was Ben McAdams. the former Democratic congressman from Salt Lake City. who hosted a dozen house parties. inviting Democratic party activists. about 30 at a time. to convince them that the best chance of removing Lee was by not fielding a Democrat on the November ballot and instead backing McMullin. We could put forward a candidate. knowing that candidate will lose. or we could be part of a coalition.  McAdams said.  It was about making Utah Democrats relevant. And here we are. In April. the state s Democratic delegates went along with the plan at their convention. McMullin also persuaded the United Utah Party not to field a candidate of their own either. and to throw their support behind him. too. There is a coalition of Utahans here that I believe are committed to American democracy.  McMullin said.To win. that coalition would need a significant share of Republican voters to turn their irritation or disappointment or anger with Lee into an actual vote for McMullin. and it is unclear whether that is possible.A more recent poll for Put Utah First found that 33% of Republicans disapprove of Lee. If all of them voted for McMullin. he would almost certainly win ― but some percentage of those appear to be voting for Lee despite their misgivings.At the Wasatch County administration building in the shadow of towering peaks already capped with snow. Karl Christopherson dropped his vote for Lee into the collection box on the floor outside the elections office. I know Mike Lee has his problems. But the other guy has even bigger problems.  said the 56-year-old product designer and recent transplant to Heber City from western New York. He said that Democratic support for McMullin would translate into McMullin s support for their agenda.  He would get his orders from them. Thirty miles to the west in the Salt Lake valley. semiretired real estate developer Lou Nield also voted for Lee. I think he sometimes puts his foot in his mouth. but I think he s an honest guy.  said Nield. 72. during a visit to the Salt Lake County government center to pay a tax bill.  The important thing is to not put a Democrat in there. and the other guy running is a Democrat. McMullin. at a pep talk a few miles away for his volunteers about to head out for an evening of door-knocking. said that accusing him of being a Democrat is all Lee has. given his inability to defend his pre-Jan. 6 actions or his overall voting record. That s just incorrect. If I wanted to be a Democrat. I d be a Democrat.  he told HuffPost.In a conference room at the Glendale branch library. McMullin reminded the group that Republicans disaffected with Lee are an important piece of his support. if he is to win. He urged them not to get upset by new polls that show Lee leading ― and closing. once again brought it back to the central message of his campaign. Our democracy is really at risk right now.  he said. but added that defeating a Trump apologist like Lee would send a powerful message.  The eyes of the nation are on us. We can do a tremendously good thing for the country. ,Politics News

This article is part of HuffPost s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.With Election Day only a few days away. the emerging consensus within the political class is that things look bad for the Democrats.As this thinking goes. Democrats are almost certainly going to lose control of the House. with as many as a few dozen seats flipping. and they are probably going to lose the Senate too.The new consensus is a reaction to some very real trends in the polls. and to signs that Democrats are shifting their resources toward protecting presumably safe districts and states. and away from races where they d hoped to pick up seats.Those decisions tell us a lot. because party leaders have access to private information. including internal polling and reports from their staff on the ground. They wouldn t be moving money to shore up safe seats if they didn t suddenly think those seats were vulnerable.But party leaders can be wrong. just as the polls can. And even the polls tell a relatively nuanced story ― about Senate. House and statewide elections that remain very close and could go either way. depending on idiosyncratic factors. last-minute campaign decisions and the always-present possibility of polling error.So with all of that in mind. here s a take on the state of the race from one reporter-analyst: me. It s based on what I am seeing in the polls. as well as what I ve observed from my own reporting in a key swing state. It s also based on what I m reading and hearing from my colleagues who have been covering this campaign on a daily basis for most of the past year. from locations across the country.When it comes to polls and putting them in context. it s hard to do better than the FiveThirtyEight prediction model. which attempts to weight surveys by recency and track record. then adjusts based on other factors like historical trends. Its House forecast has been moving in a Republican direction since late September and. as of this writing. pegs chances of Republicans capturing the House at 84%. Its Senate model puts Republican chances of getting the Senate at 54%. On Oct. 30 ― i.e.. less than a week ago ― the model still had Democrats as slight favorites to hold the Senate.And it s not just an overall trend. The forecasts for specific races are shifting in ways that also suggest Democrats are in trouble. In the Georgia Senate race. polls now show Republican nominee Herschel Walker pulling ahead of Raphael Warnock. the Democratic incumbent. In the New Hampshire Senate race. surveys are picking up trouble for incumbent Democrat Maggie Hassan. who once enjoyed a comfortable lead.It s a similar story on the House side. where seats once thought safe now appear to be in jeopardy. One of those belongs to Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.). who is chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The Cook Political Report just shifted its forecast for that district from  lean Democrat  to  toss-up. One reason for the change. as my colleague Daniel Marans detailed in a recent dispatch. is fundraising. Maloney s campaign has raised more money than the committee for his Republican opponent. Assembly Member Mike Lawler. But outside money from Republican super PACs has overwhelmed the money coming from their Democratic counterparts. That s also the story nationally. as Daniel and our colleague Kevin Robillard explained in a separate article. The GOP super PACs  have massive fundraising and spending advantages over their Democratic counterparts  in this cycle. they wrote.Democrats have reacted by putting more money into those suddenly vulnerable districts. which has inevitably meant spending less in more contested districts where they once hoped to pick up seats ― producing what a recent Politico report described as a  shrinking battlefield. It s easy enough to put together a coherent narrative for why Democratic prospects are suddenly looking so much worse than they did just a few weeks ago. It goes like this: Voters punish the incumbent party when they re worried about the economy. and polls suggest inflation is the No. 1 issue on minds of voters ― even more so than it was earlier in the year. when the Supreme Court s decision to overrule Roe v. Wade was fresher in everybody s minds.And in the final weeks of the campaign. Republican-leaning voters who d been describing themselves as undecided are rallying around their party s candidates. even those who. like Walker. have been dogged by controversies and questions about their basic fitness for office.But a sensible-sounding narrative can still be wrong. partly or entirely. And so it s worth considering why the apparent public opinion shifts and reports about party-level decisions might not be such good predictors of the final outcome.The place to start is with the polls themselves. and a closer look at where they are as of this writing. Pay particular attention to the Senate. where control is likely to come down to the outcomes of four races: Arizona. Georgia. Nevada and Pennsylvania. Democrats probably need to win three of those to hold the majority. (I say  probably  because the number could go up or down if other races defy expectations.)In FiveThirtyEight s model. Arizona still looks pretty good for the Democrat. incumbent Mark Kelly. with his chances of holding the seat at 66%. And in Pennsylvania. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman remains the slight favorite at 54%. Democrats are now underdogs in Georgia and Nevada. but the Democrats in those races (Warnock and. for Nevada. incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto) still have chances above 40%. The poll numbers for Georgia and Nevada are the main reason the prediction models are now tipping toward Republican control of the Senate. But the margins in those and several other races are still relatively small. enough so that routine polling errors could change the outcome.Conversations about polling error frequently focus on the misses in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. when surveys and models underestimated support for Donald Trump. That could certainly happen again. But polling errors can run in both directions. and there are plenty of recent examples of polls underestimating Democratic strength ― a point that a handful of analysts. including Tom Bonier and Simon Rosenberg. have been making on social media.Bonier is CEO of TargetSmart. a Democratic-aligned consulting firm. Rosenberg is CEO of NDN and the New Policy Institute. a left-leaning think tank and advocacy organization. But less partisan analysts have also been urging caution in using their forecasts.DemocratsRepublicansfew percentage points off the final marknormalClose margins also mean that outcomes can depend on late. seemingly minor swings in public opinion or ticks in turnout. Those swings can go in either direction. so that s not a reason to assume prospects for Democrats will improve in the final few days before Election Day. But it s also not a reason to take for granted that every thin Republican margin will hold.As regular readers of this newsletter know ― or may have guessed ― I work out of Michigan. where I ve lived for more than 20 years. It s a politically divided state that voted for Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. and where control of state government is now up for grabs. Gretchen Whitmer. the Democratic governor. is up for reelection. as are the other statewide offices including secretary of state and attorney general. (HuffPost s Travis Waldron wrote about that here.) Control of the state legislature is in play. thanks to nonpartisan redistricting that ended a severe Republican gerrymander. (Travis covered that topic here.) There s no U.S. Senate race. but there are several closely contested House races ― including the contest between Democratic incumbent Elissa Slotkin and Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett. reportedly the most expensive in the country.The forecast for Democrats here is brighter than in some other parts of the U.S. Whitmer has been ahead of her GOP opponent. former right-wing commentator Tudor Dixon. in nearly every poll. Slotkin has been the narrow favorite to win again. while another Democratic candidate. former Justice Department attorney Hillary Scholten. is the slight favorite to win in what had (pre-redistricting) been a Republican-leaning area.The same caveats and cautions about poll misses that apply nationally should apply here. These races have all gotten tighter in the past few weeks. and it s easy ― very. very easy ― to imagine Democrats losing some or all of them. But having spent the past few weeks covering the governor s race closely ― for an article that will appear very soon ― I haven t seen the kind of indicators I ve seen in previous campaigns when one candidate was surging. Dixon s events draw bigger crowds than Whitmer s. but they re not overwhelming and Whitmer hasn t been advertising hers as broadly. The Dixon supporters I ve met and interviewed (and encountered in daily life) have been longtime Republicans. not recent converts.A key factor is reproductive rights. which is central to the election here because Michigan has a 1931 law banning abortion in nearly all cases. A series of state court rulings have blocked enforcement for now. but that could change depending on who gets control of state government ― and whether a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution passes.There are indications (starting with the record-breaking number of signatures that the initiative s sponsors collected) that the amendment. and abortion access more generally. will drive up turnout among Democrats. helping them to meet or outperform their poll numbers. And it s entirely possible the same thing will happen in other states where abortion is a live issue.Of course. it s also possible that Michigan voters are souring on the amendment. thanks to a massive (and deeply deceptive) propaganda campaign by its opponents. and that the polls are undercounting Republicans here just as they did before. For that matter. it s possible that what I m seeing and hearing firsthand isn t indicative of broader trends. here or (especially) in other parts of the country. Things certainly don t look as promising for Katie Hobbs. currently secretary of state in Arizona and the Democratic gubernatorial nominee there. s HuffPost s Liz Skalka recounted last weekBut in many ways. that uncertainty about individual races and the overall national trend is the point ― or my point. anyway. The clues we have about what will happen in this year s election are real. but we don t always know what they mean or how important they are. That s a good reason not to jump to feeling overly confident about anybody s predictions. And if you feel strongly about how the election turns out ― as you should. given the enormous stakes ― then that s also a good reason to keep advocating for your causes. and to make sure you vote. ,Politics News

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An Indianapolis doctor who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio is suing Indiana s attorney general. seeking to block him from using allegedly  frivolous  consumer complaints to issue subpoenas seeking patients  confidential medical records.The lawsuit targeting Attorney General Todd Rokita was filed Thursday in Marion County on behalf of Dr. Caitlin Bernard. an Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist. her medical partner. Dr. Amy Caldwell. and their patients.It alleges that Rokita has issued subpoenas seeking the medical records of patients based on complaints from people who have never been a patient of either Bernard or Caldwell and  who lack any personal knowledge of the alleged circumstances giving rise to the complaints. The suit contends that Rokita has  completely ignored  a state requirement that his office first determine that consumer complaints have  merit  before he can investigate physicians and other licensed professionals and that his conduct  violates numerous Indiana statutes.  The Attorney General has wholly ignored the General Assembly s fine-tuned structure for handling consumer complaints regarding licensed professionals and has engaged in precisely the type of overbearing. harassing conduct that the General Assembly sought to prohibit.  the suit states.she gave an interview to The Indianapolis Star about the 10-year-old girlU.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

It also seeks such injunctions to block him from issuing subpoenas related to an investigation based on a consumer complaint  without first making a valid and proper determination that the consumer complaint has merit.  and to prevent Rokita from  violating confidentiality provisions imposed by law. The suit names as defendants Rokita and Scott Barnhart. the chief counsel of the state attorney general s office and also director of its office of consumer protection.It alleges that the  improper conduct  by Rokita and Barnhart  threatens patients seeking legal abortions that their most personal and private medical records and health care decisions could be exposed as part of a meritless investigation.

In the final stretch of the heated Georgia Senate campaign. Republican Herschel Walker has been letting people know an important fact: He has never met Barack Obama. The former president held a rally last Friday for Walker s Democratic opponent. incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock. and seemed to enjoy dunking on Walker as an unqualified celebrity candidate. An apparently stung Walker took to a radio show hosted by Fox News  Brian Kilmeade on Tuesday to respond.  I m not sure why he came here just to go after me.  Walker said.  Yet he said I m a celebrity. but all he hung out with was celebrities. He never hung out with me so I can t be a celebrity. The following day. the former NFL player joined Kilmeade on air at Fox News and repeated his line. specifying he had never even met the 44th president.  I ve never met him before. and if I m a celebrity. I would ve met him because all he did was hang out with celebrities.  Walker said.These claims are contradicted by one key person. however: Herschel Walker. During a commemorative celebration for Martin Luther King Jr. at Austin College in 2020. Walker told a story:  You know what is so funny. I used to play basketball with President Obama. He smokes. I don t know if y all know that but he smokes.  he said.  I used to let homeboy school me up. Let s be real. only because he had a lot of security.  Walker added while laughing. He repeated the same tale nearly word-for-word a year earlier at a suicide prevention month event hosted by the military in Tacoma. Washington. on Sept. 11. 2019.This time. Walker included more detail. describing an alleged one-on-one game.  I used to let homeboy post me up. post Herschel Walker up. I m serious. I used to let him post me up. make a lay-up and stuff and he would talk a lot of trash. I don t know if y all know that but he would talk a lot of trash.  Walker said as the crowd laughed. In 2017. while visiting Fort Benning in Georgia. Walker again recounted that he played basketball with Obama. let the former president  post him up.  and teased a possible future game.  So we re playing again.  Walker said.  I m calling his butt up. We re going to play another. and I m going to let him know what time it is. It is not clear whether Walker was wrong this week. or in 2017. 2019 and 2020 when he described a pickup basketball game and suggested he had Obama s phone number. Walker s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. nor did Obama s post-presidential office. There are no mentions of Walker on Obama s archived White House webpage. and HuffPost could not turn up any press mentions of Walker at any event with Obama. Walker did appear at one White House exercise event ― but it was in 2018 when Donald Trump was president. ,Politics News
Last year Democrats boasted about a new monthly allowance they d created for households with kids. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it  a life-changing victory for families  and described it as tantamount to  Social Security for children.  President Joe Biden made a similar comparison and said it was one of the things he would be  most proud of  when his term ends. But the allowance lasted only six months. and the triumphant messages have been largely absent from the campaign trail ahead of next weeks  midterm elections. in which Republicans stand a strong chance of winning one or both chambers of Congress. Democrats have instead mostly campaigned on protecting abortion rights. which are under threat after the Supreme Court declared an end to the federal right to abortion access over the summer. while Republicans have leaned on messages about crime. inflation and Biden.When it comes to economic policy. Democrats have been more likely to talk about the original Social Security ― the beloved retirement benefit for seniors ― than the monthly benefit parents received last year through the expanded child tax credit. Democratic campaign ads have highlighted the party s support for reducing costs for the middle class. and any mention of  middle class tax cuts  could semi-plausibly be a reference to the child tax credit. since the monthly payments the IRS sent out last year technically were. in fact. tax credits. But out of hundreds of campaign ads this cycle. few mention the child tax credit by name. According to a new analysis of campaign ads published Thursday by the Wesleyan Media Project. just 0.2% of federal campaign ads in the general election have mentioned the child tax credit.Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley hit his Democratic challenger. Mike Franken. for opposing the child tax credit because he favored repealing the 2017 Republican tax cuts. which expanded the credit before Democrats built on that expansion last year. Another ad. from a super PAC boosting Evan McMullin. the independent challenging incumbent Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). calls out Lee for having opposed the Democratic child tax credit last year. Neither of those got into any specifics about the child tax credit. From July through December. most parents in the U.S. received as much as $300 per child each month. a taste of the kind of child benefit that other developed countries have long provided. As a result of the payments. child poverty fell to nearly half its rate before the cash payments began. But reducing child poverty. apparently. does not make great campaign fodder. The payments were modestly popular. but much less so than empowering Medicare to negotiate cheaper prescription drugs ― another. more recent Democratic policy achievement that has been the centerpiece of plenty of campaign ads.And the payments stopped at the end of 2021 after Democrats couldn t get Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to agree to an extension. They could argue that electing Democrats would bring the payments back. but many Democrats have decided that it s simpler to argue that electing Republicans could result in cuts to Social Security. since a handful of GOP lawmakers have suggested they d like to trim those retirement benefits. Another factor might be that Democrats are wary of touting any of the party s domestic policy accomplishments given Biden s unpopularity and voters  dissatisfaction with inflation.More than half of likely voters see  the economy and inflation  as their top concern when deciding whom to vote for. according to a poll CNN commissioned in late October. Half of those same voters said they trust Republicans more than Democrats to solve their top concern.In some of their advertisements. Republicans have also seized on the fact that stimulus payments went to convicted felons. (Republicans have not bothered to mention that they. too. supported two rounds of stimulus checks that did not exclude felons.)It s possible that Republicans could have also depicted the expanded child tax credit as a welfare handout to undeserving families. They already criticized the short-lived benefit for lacking a work requirement for eligibility.Manchin. the most conservative Democrat in the Senate. objected to extending the credit on the grounds that it would encourage welfare dependence. He told his Democratic colleagues last year that he fears recipients of the additional cash would spend the money on drugs rather than on family necessities.Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet. who is the Senate s chief champion of the expanded Child Tax Credit. is perhaps the one Democrat who has made the policy a central part of his campaign. Bennet touted his work getting the expanded tax credit into the American Rescue Plan Act in an April 2021 TV ad that still does not mention the policy by name. Bennet is  getting answers: putting $3.000 in the pockets of Colorado families. cutting child poverty nearly in half. and making sure our economy works for all of us.  the narrator in the ad says.Addressing a crowd of Democratic supporters in Pueblo on Sunday. Bennet said that he mounted his short-lived campaign for president in 2019 in order to pass the legislation. and was proud of its inclusion in Biden s COVID-19 economic rescue package. We demonstrated that we don t have to accept this level of childhood poverty as a permanent state of our economy or a permanent state of our democracy.  he declared.  And I can tell you. the main reason I want to go back there is to make that permanent. That s what we have to do. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. an independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats. is not up for reelection this year. But in his efforts to campaign for the party to maintain its hold of the House and Senate. Sanders has emphasized the expanded child tax credit.The GuardianBennet and many other Democrats have also said they ll try to bring back the child tax credit by leveraging their support for a host of expiring business tax cuts during the lame duck session of Congress. before newly-elected lawmakers are sworn in. It remains unclear how they would get Manchin or any Republicans on board with that strategy. however. Bennet believes that the expiration of the expanded child tax credit after less than a year is a key reason why Democrats are reluctant to run on it. There s a conventional wisdom that it s a complicated situation because it was here and then went away.  he told HuffPost in an interview after his event in Pueblo.  And that s a hard thing. It s hard to explain to people how that happened. ,Politics News

BRADDOCK. Pa. ― John Fetterman has no shortage of fans in the small steel town where he served as mayor for 13 years. The Democratic Senate nominee s most dedicated supporters often have stories of his gallantry. When Marcie Gans was fired from a home health aide job a few years ago. she fell $1.200 behind on her mortgage. To avoid foreclosure. Gans began selling her worldly possessions in a yard sale. Gans invited Fetterman to check out her sale items. but he offered to lend her the money. rather than purchase items he didn t need. Months later. having recovered financially. Gans tried to pay Fetterman back. He refused. He said. ‘It s nobody s business. but I live off a big trust fund. and I help other people with it. And I appreciate you. Help somebody with your money.   Gans recalled.  That s the type of person he is!  heavily subsidizedDenise McClinton. a resident of neighboring Rankin. remembers Fetterman s work helping her children graduate from high school and get jobs while he was running a program for high school dropouts prior to becoming mayor.  He did more than anybody else would for them. Rodney Surratt. who owns a small landscaping business in Braddock. credits Fetterman with giving him paid work to beautify the town.  He got my vote ― I wish I could vote again and again. After more than three terms as mayor. Fetterman was elected lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in 2018. He now faces Republican Mehmet Oz in the U.S. Senate contest.Fetterman s tenure as Braddock mayor has been a cornerstone of his pitch for higher office. He promises to champion Pennsylvania s forgotten cities and towns because. he says. he already has the experience of reviving a borough that much of the state had written off as irreparable.Fetterman used his family wealth to found a nonprofit. Braddock Redux. that circumvented the local government to buy up and revive abandoned properties that could then be leveraged for additional private and public investment. The result is a revived downtown artery. Braddock Avenue. the arrival of popular community services like the Free Store erected by Fetterman s wife. Gisele Barreto Fetterman. and a national interest in the town that has even lured new employers. There has been some change since he was here.  Hope Pickens. who grew up in neighboring North Braddock. said after Sunday services at the Holliday Memorial AME Zion Church in Braddock on Oct. 16.  There s light and traffic and people moving around. and you can go shopping and go into a store. But some residents say that Fetterman generated more hype for his achievements than they deserved. especially given the persistence of poverty and crime in the town. The gentrification that you see around has never really reached the people. so that there are people here who are still struggling while there are businesses that are thriving.  said Demetrius Baldwin. a diversity. equity and inclusion consultant who grew up in Braddock and still lives here.Growing up. Annette Baldwin. 84. remembers Braddock Avenue as a bustling strip of commercial activity. There were three movie theaters.  shoe stores galore.  and plenty of places to dine and enjoy an adult beverage. On at least one occasion. Frank Sinatra performed at one of the night clubs. according to Baldwin. a retired school district secretary and Democratic Party activist. Everybody came to Braddock because it was here.  Baldwin. who is Demetrius s grandmother. told HuffPost over coffee after services at the Holliday Memorial AME Zion Church.Braddock thrived for so many years as a hub for neighboring boroughs along the Monongahela River ― a region known locally as the  Mon Valley  ― thanks to its central place in the steel industry. In 1875. Andrew Carnegie chose Braddock as the site for his Edgar Thomson Plant. his first steel mill.As the steel industry declined. Braddock s fortunes fell as well. first gradually and then precipitously. in 1978. when the Carrie Blast Furnaces in neighboring Rankin ceased operation. Braddock is now home to just over 1.700 residents ― down from its peak of nearly 21.000 in 1920. About 70% of the town s residents are Black descendants of Southerners who migrated north for opportunity in the early and middle 20th century. The plumes of smoke that emerge periodically from U.S. Steel s Edgar Thomson Plant. which operates with a fraction of the workforce it once employed. are the last living remnant of Braddock s storied industrial past.It was this Braddock where Fetterman arrived in 2001 in the hopes of helping disadvantaged kids. He started a GED program for the community s high school dropouts.Fetterman. a conspicuously tall white man from central Pennsylvania. encountered his fair share of skepticism. When he first came here. he came kind of with a black cloud.  recalled Lisa Baldwin. an Allegheny County employee and real estate broker. who was also at Holliday Memorial AME Zion Church. (Lisa is Annette s daughter. and Demetrius  mother.) This is a Black town.  she said.  And so here s another white male coming into our town ― like. ‘Who is this?  But Fetterman slowly won residents over through his dedication to the young people and his use of his family s insurance industry fortune to host giveaways of Christmas gifts. school supplies and bicycles for Braddock s children.When two of Fetterman s GED students were gunned down. Fetterman decided to run for mayor in 2005. He ended up surpassing Virginia Bunn by one vote in the Democratic primary. (Both candidates outperformed incumbent Mayor Pauline Abdullah.)The structure of Braddock s borough government does not give mayors much power beyond overseeing the police department and breaking tie votes on the council. Once elected. Fetterman nonetheless came into conflict with members of Braddock s political establishment. who saw him as a self-interested white interloper. Rather than work with them. he used his Braddock Redux nonprofit. erected with his share of the family fortune. to circumvent them. The nonprofit would buy up properties that were either abandoned or in disrepair and use them to subsidize private development or turn them into community spaces.Some locals resented that Fetterman s plans were not the product of a democratic process. For example. in 2009. Fetterman agreed to let Levi s Jeans film some TV ads in the town that made the town s decaying infrastructure seem like an exciting frontier of American reinvention. Rather than pay the borough government for the privilege of filming. Levi s contributed more than $1 million to Fetterman s nonprofit. The money went toward the funding of a community farm. the town library and the renovation of an old church that opened as a community center in 2010. There was no community discussion of where that million dollars was going to go.  said Tony Buba. a filmmaker who grew up in Braddock and now lives in neighboring Braddock Hills. More community input might have prompted Fetterman to prioritize making the building accessible for people with disabilities over restoring the old church s stained-glass windows. Buba lamented.beginning in 2004The building does lack complete wheelchair accessibility and is undergoing additional renovations to become more wheelchair accessible.Referring to the members of the borough council during Fetterman s early years as mayor. Gans said.  These are people who finally got on council and did nothing ― nothing! The community center is now home to Aunt Cheryl s Café. a lunch spot that opened in 2016. Cheryl Johnson. a former Braddock resident who now lives in Penn Hills. would not be able to sustain the business without the discounted rent she receives from Fetterman s nonprofit. which still owns the community center building. For several years prior. Fetterman had allowed her to use the space free. He s done a lot in a short time.  Johnson said.Walking down Braddock Avenue. there s now an Italian restaurant at the entrance to town and a boutique brewery farther down.The old Ohringer Building. a shuttered furniture store with a classic neon sign. has become housing for artists. with a gallery on the ground floor. The building that once housed Hollander s drug store has become the Hollander Project. a co-working space and business incubator founded by Fetterman s wife. Gisele. And. of course. even Fetterman s harshest critics admit that the Free Store ― another Gisele brainchild ― is one of the lasting achievements of Fetterman s mayoralty. The store. housed in recycled shipping containers. is a depot of donated clothing and other household items ― from dog food to baby formula ― that provides all comers a chance to walk away with whatever necessities catch their eye. free of charge.When HuffPost visited the Free Store on Oct. 18. there was a line of people waiting outside on an unusually cold day to peruse the day s offerings as Gisele Fetterman and other volunteers organized the items and tended to customers.Following her husband s nearly fatal stroke in May. Gisele campaigned in his stead while he recovered for a few months and she continues to engage with the press frequently on behalf of the Senate campaign.In an interview just outside of the store. Gisele. an immigrant from Brazil. told HuffPost that she came up with the idea to start the Free Store in 2012 because when she first arrived in the United States. she had been a  dumpster diver  and  curbside shopper.   I just knew that that could help so many other people as well.  she said.  So I wanted to create a space where all that can happen and be a really loving. supportive and dignified space. For Terrance Murtaza. a retired school bus monitor. who walked away with several items. the Free Store also provided an essential gathering place. And while the facility is Gisele s brainchild. Murtaza identified it as a part of her husband s legacy as well. He accomplished a sense of unity within the community where people can come out and not only come to the Free Store. but they can come out and help each other and they can also see exactly what s going on with people. how bad things are for them. especially older people.  he said.Other Fetterman family projects have elicited a rockier reception. In 2013. Fetterman began collaborating with star chef Kevin Sousa to launch what. at the time. would have been Braddock s only sit-down restaurant. He agreed to give Sousa free use of part of a former Superior Motors car dealership for the business. (Fetterman and his family live in a separate part of the shuttered car dealership compound.) After several delays. the restaurant. simply named Superior Motors. got up and running in 2017. Sousa. who agreed to train and employ Braddock residents. served small and pricey haute-cuisine dishes that catered mostly to more affluent diners from outside of the borough. Braddock residents were entitled to a 50% discount on every dish. but few Braddockites who spoke to HuffPost seemed aware of that.  Superior Motors was a failure.  said Shayla Wolford. who works at Aunt Cheryl s Café and was otherwise extremely positive about Fetterman s tenure.  People that live here can t afford it. Amid the strain of a COVID-19-related closure. Sousa severed ties to the restaurant in August 2021. Despite some indications from the project s investors that the restaurant would reopen in a new form. nothing has yet taken shape.Starting around 2009. Fetterman began getting national attention for his work in Braddock. Rolling Stone called him the  mayor of hell.  The New York Times used the gentler moniker  Mayor of Rust.  And The Atlantic hailed Fetterman s  record of success in revitalizing Braddock.  The magazine profiles. along with some TV segments. tended to exhibit a kind of lurid fascination with Fetterman. a 6-foot-8 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who wore Carhartt and Dickies apparel because he was a man of the people. Fetterman s forearm tattoos with Braddock s ZIP code and the dates of violent deaths that occurred on his watch as mayor. also figure prominently in those accounts. The audience was enchanted.  the Times wrote of the reception to a speech Fetterman delivered at the 2010 Aspen Ideas Festival.  Here was a guy in biker boots bringing the Park Slope (Aspen. Marin. Portland. Santa Fe) ethos — organic produce. art installations. an outdoor bread oven — to the disenfranchised. Fetterman s aesthetic and knack for public relations were unique. But in some ways. he was simply taking a trendy model of local governance in post-industrial towns to new heights.In the absence of a national economic development strategy for struggling municipalities or the ability to deficit-spend their way onto sounder fiscal footing. cities and towns are forced to compete with one another for corporate investment or financing from nonprofit benefactors.  That s the menu of options that Fetterman or anyone else in his situation has at their disposal.  said David A. Banks. a lecturer in geography and planning at the University at Albany.That predicament is especially acute in the Mon Valley. where there are myriad small and impoverished municipalities that sustain their own public services rather than pooling their resources for maximum efficiency.Fetterman himself acknowledged the reality of courting philanthropists with whatever tools he had.Praising Levi s for its contribution to Braddock through his nonprofit following the filming of their TV ads. Fetterman told NPR in 2010.  If someone wants to give me $100 million. I ll kiss their ass and call it ice cream.  These small towns  only competitive advantage that can t be outsourced is fundamentally their own history and identity.  said Banks. author of the forthcoming book  The City Authentic.  which examines how cities commodify their history to woo young professionals.  Braddock being very central to the history of manufacturing. and specifically steel. in the United States. Fetterman found a way to both turn that into a positive by taking that history and making it a theme that artists and restaurateurs could use to do the things they re already doing. But if Fetterman was simply playing the hand he was dealt as mayor of a troubled small town. the criticism his approach elicited is also a common reaction to these public relations-fueled development strategies. Part of the strategy of attracting private or nonprofit investment in a town like Braddock is to play up its mystique in the press and paint a picture of the town in the imagination of investors. nonprofit donors and prospective newcomers that is not necessarily the same as the reality experienced by longtime residents. Any mayor in these sorts of situations will always take more credit than they re due. It s part of the job.  Banks said.  A lot of it is faking it  til you make it. Rev. Vincent Martin. the pastor of Holliday Memorial AME Zion Church and a resident of Pittsburgh. described having mixed feelings about the credit that Fetterman received for his mayoralty. He suggested that Fetterman s identity as a white man had helped draw attention to Braddock that it had not previously received. That was ultimately a positive thing. even if the reasons for it were unfair. according to Martin. There ve been workers and people trying to do things. but it never broke through until he became the face of that thing and that became a point of recognition for the outside.  Martin said.Years after his mayoralty. though. some Braddock residents told HuffPost that they tire of media outlets continuing to depict Fetterman as a larger-than-life white rescuer.  A reporter asked me. ‘What is it like to be rescued?   said Chardae Jones. who succeeded Fetterman as mayor of Braddock from 2019 to 2021 and is supporting his bid for Senate. They were serious.  she recalled.  And I was like. ‘Have you ever seen the interior of Braddock? Because it s like ‘The Twilight Zone.  It s been the same forever.   Indeed. even as Braddock Avenue became a livelier thoroughfare for commerce under Fetterman s leadership. the town s progress on core human-development indices has been mixed at best. Braddock s population declined from more than 2.000 people in 2010 to just over 1.700 people in 2018. the last year of Fetterman s tenure as mayor. Over that same period. the percentage of people in the town with incomes below the federal poverty level declined modestly. according to census data. But when the poverty rate drops from 37.4% in 2010 to 35.7% in 2018. economic hardship remains so prevalent that some residents do not see much progress.Braddock Inclusion ProjectIn her interview with HuffPost. Gisele Barreto Fetterman mocked the idea that her husband had moved to Braddock in 2001 with a scheme to leverage his work there into a career in higher office.  Four terms he spent as mayor ― that was his long-term plan. right? He came here to teach GED so that one day he could run for lieutenant governor.  she mused sarcastically.  I think it s important to look at who the critics are and what their motives are. but it s a free country.  open the mansion s pool up He never left.  observed Annette Baldwin.The Fetterman family s commitment to the town is simply something that cannot be faked. according to Gans. Why would he pick us? He didn t have to live here in Braddock.  she recalled replying to Fetterman s skeptics on the borough council.  Why would he come slumming if he didn t have an interest in us?  Fetterman has touted his success in reducing violent crime in Braddock more than any other aspect of his 13-year tenure as mayor.From the moment Oz. his Republican Senate opponent. began accusing him of trying to free too many convicted criminals as chair of Pennsylvania s board of pardons. Fetterman shot back with TV ads recounting how two of his GED students  murders inspired him to run for mayor in the first place. I worked side by side with the police. showed up at crime scenes.  Fetterman says in one 30-second spot.  We did whatever it took to fund our police ― and stopped gun deaths for five years. Braddock indeed went more than five years. from 2008 to 2013. without a murder in its boundaries.  I am a Democrat that is running on my record on crime.  Fetterman has taken to saying in his stump speech.Today. when asked about Fetterman s public safety legacy. people living in and around Braddock focus on the same tattoos marking local deaths that have become an indelible part of his national image.Some Braddock residents told HuffPost that they fondly remember Fetterman s efforts to make the town safer simply through his constant presence on the town s streets. He just did the work.  Shayla Wolford said.  He was out here all the time ― crime scenes. things like that. funerals ― he was there. He tried to make everybody else care. But Fetterman s zeal for reducing violence in Braddock led to the biggest scandal of his political career. While standing outside with his son on a late afternoon in January 2013. Fetterman heard what he describes as a  crushing burst of gunfire  coming from an area known as a hub for gun violence. Spotting a man jogging nearby with a face mask. Fetterman. armed with a shotgun. pursued him in his pickup truck and detained him until the police arrived. The man. Christopher Miyares. was Black and turned out to simply be jogging. unarmed.Miyares claimed that Fetterman pointed the shotgun at his chest. but Fetterman denied it. Fetterman has refused to apologize for his actions. claiming that he was trying to faithfully execute his duties as mayor and that due to Miyares  attire. which concealed most of his skin. he was unaware of Miyares  race when he decided to pursue him. I made a split-second decision to call 911. get my son to safety and intercept an individual. the only individual out running from where the gunfire came. and intercept him until our first responders arrived as Braddock s chief law enforcement officer and as the mayor.  Fetterman said in a Democratic primary debate in April. shortly before his stroke.Most people with whom HuffPost spoke in Braddock were either ambivalent about the 2013 incident or outright sympathetic to Fetterman.Lisa Baldwin characterized herself as  right in the middle  between his critics and his fiercest defenders.  I understood why he did it. but at the same time. had it been a white guy. would you have done it?  she wondered.  Because that s always in the back of our minds. Gans believes that Fetterman responded reasonably. If I couldn t take the crime … and I live way up on the border [of town]. how do you think he felt. and he had young kids?  asked Gans.But Chartia Worlds. Miyares  sister. is still angry about the incident ― and Fetterman s response to it. The problem is. he didn t get in any trouble.  she told HuffPost.  He didn t apologize. Worlds. a food service worker. grew up in Braddock but now lives with her kids in neighboring Turtle Creek. She still frequents the Free Store from time to time and describes Gisele as  lovely. Worlds is not sure she can bring herself to vote for Fetterman. though. If she does cast a ballot for him. she won t do it enthusiastically. You just pick the lesser of two evils.  she said.  That s how I feel. ,Politics News

Oath KeepersDonald TrumpJoe BidenThe acquaintance. Jason Alpers. claimed he could get the message into Trump s hands through an  indirect  pipeline.Rhodes typed up the letter. which was entered into evidence at the Oath Keepers  seditious conspiracy trial in federal court on Wednesday. after Alpers became a government witness. You must use the insurrection act and use the power of the Presidency to stop him.  Rhodes urged Trump. according to prosecutors.USA Today reportedrepeatedly pushed the dubious ideaAlpers reportedly thought Rhodes  words were too extreme. I am here for you and so are all my men. We will come help you if you need us. Military and police. And so will your millions of supporters.  Rhodes allegedly wrote.If Trump did not act. Rhodes allegedly warned. the results would be grim. If you don t then Biden/Kamala will turn all that power on you. your family. and all of us.  the letter read.  You and your children will die in prison. And us veterans will die in combat on US soil. fighting against traitors who YOU turned over all the powers of the Presidency to. Rhodes allegedly urged Trump to  be a Churchill. not a Chamberlain (the British Prime Minister who wanted to appease Hitler). Rhodes and four other Oath Keepers have been on trial for weeks on charges of seditious conspiracy. which carries a potential 20-year prison sentence. for their role in the Capitol attack. A handful of Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty to the charge. while others face trial next month.Attorneys for Rhodes and the others have largely sought to portray the Oath Keepers as a security force that tried to help law enforcement on Jan. 6. 2021.No cameras are permitted in the courtroom.On Wednesday. prosecutors shared messages between the group members that were sent after the riot. In the messages. Rhodes instructed his followers to  sit tight  and  prepare yourselves. your gear. your teams. and above all your community  while he worked on his plan to keep Trump in office.

Alpers testified that he wore the wire for his own  protection.  to make sure he got the message right.On the recording played in court.

He ll go down in history as the greatest president since George Washington if he does the right thing. If not. we re gonna have a slave uprising. Throughout the recording. Rhodes appears convinced that Biden. as president. would use the Insurrection Act to throw Trump supporters in prison. At another point. Rhodes lamented that the group did not bring their high-powered rifles to Capitol Hill.

Sara Campos remembers being inspired to start skateboarding after playing Tony Hawk videogames on the California family s PlayStation 2.Campos. 23. who uses they/them pronouns. never dreamed they would be part of Tony Hawk s charitable work. But last month. Campos was selected for the first class in The Skatepark Project s fellowship program. The program trains 12 diverse skateboarding enthusiasts in community organizing and project management to be able to build a skatepark in their neighborhoods. Not only does the program hope to create a new gathering place in minority communities. It also aims to support and train young minority leaders. It s almost like a dream come true.  said Campos. who used to draw skatepark designs on printer paper to show their parents.  Getting to do that again. but for real this time. is one of those things you didn t actually think would happen. It s almost exactly what Hawk hoped for when he launched this initiative. With this program. we are engaging these kids — not only to advocate for a skatepark for their use but also to realize that their voices can matter. that they can effect change.  Hawk said.  If you re a city looking for more projects that are inclusive. that are diverse. I think skateboarding is at the top of the list these days. Hawk. who won 73 championships by age 25 and was world champion of vert skating for 12 straight years in the 1980s and  90s. noted that the sport has changed dramatically over the years. He no longer hears people shouting.  White boy sport.  at him while he s on his board.He now sees a wide array of races and genders when he visits skateparks. It s a shift that he hopes to foster with his nonprofit work. My style was so mechanical that I became an outcast within the skate community. but I did find my own sense of identity and community at the skatepark.  Hawk said.  It s an individual pursuit. but you are bolstered by the community around you. And then they support you in your endeavors. Neftalie Williams. a sociologist and expert on skateboarding culture as well as a provost postdoctoral scholar at USC s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. said he is excited by the prospect of having skateparks built through the fellowship program. These young people care passionately about skateboarding and are now getting training to be able to carry out their mission and get the work done.  Williams said.  It s not just getting the skatepark built or getting knowledge within these young people s hands. They re gonna have generational knowledge that s going to passed down and there are very few things that allow that. The Skatepark Project – which began as the Tony Hawk Foundation in 2002. funded by Hawk s $125.000 win on the celebrity edition of  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  – saw the fellowship as a response. of sorts. to the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Hawk said he believes the fellowship can help address racial inequality as well as provide opportunities for a new generation of minority leaders.Williams. who is also on The Skatepark Project s board of directors. recalled Hawk and his team saying:  How do we do more? There s a racial reckoning that s going on. There needs to be more representation (in skateboarding) for LGBTQ+ communities. There needs to be more work for Indigenous folks. How do you take this platform and really take it to the next level. really empower the next generation? Creating a new generation of skateboarding advocates who also understand the mechanics of community organizing is part of the answer.Nicole Humphrey. program coordinator for the fellowship. wants each fellow to create a skatepark that reflects their community and its needs. while also being economically sustainable. But she also wants them to feel that they can apply what they learn in this fellowship to future projects beyond skateboarding. from building other public spaces in their communities to making their voices heard on issues that concern them. What I learned very early is there wasn t a book or anything to reference.  said Humphrey. a community organizer who also co-founded the nonprofit Black Girls Skate. dedicated to supporting minority skateboarders.  There s nothing like it. We re really honestly building it from scratch. and it s been fun. But I think my entry point was really just being in the organizing space. Though the Skatepark Project fellowships began only in September. Campos. a communications and digital marketing specialist at Utopia PDX. has already learned much about what they need to do to build a skatepark in Northeast Portland. one that can be  a space where once you show up. you just feel like you belong there. Campos also received plenty of information they can use for Queer Skate PDX. the nonprofit they co-founded to support women. LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming people getting started in skateboarding by offering them needed equipment and sponsoring events to meet other skaters. As a person of color who lives in a state that is predominantly white. it makes it a little bit harder to find community groups that you can relate to.  said Campos. whose family is from Guam.  I had the idea of trying to prioritize and uplift all of these marginalized communities. as well as serving everyone as a whole. Campos said the fellowship has given them a deeper knowledge about the history of skateboarding as well as what the sport has done for them. Skating has brought me a group of friends and connections and community that I would not have if it wasn t for skating.  Campos said. adding that they also met their partner. Rochelle. through the sport.  It s taught me a lot in terms of falling down and getting back up. It s taught me a lot about courage. _____https://apnews.com/hub/philanthropy,Politics News

A chorus of economic experts have warned [that] hiking interest rates again is a recipe for millions of Americans receiving pink slips. yet the Fed has decided to triple down on what is not working.  said Liz Zelnick. a spokeswoman for the liberal group Accountable.US.Claudia Sahm. a former Fed economist. said that more rate hikes will eventually  push financial markets to a breaking point. wrote in a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome PowellAt a press conference Wednesday. Powell suggested they he would be willing to slow the economy to a crawl if that s what it takes to control inflation. And he suggested workers have excessive bargaining power because there are too many job openings.  The labor market continues to be out of balance. with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.  he said.he central bank announced that it had once again hiked interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point. continuing the highest pace of rate increases in decades in order to bring down the worst inflation in decades. Higher interest rates make money more expensive to borrow. which makes people spend less. which ideally forces corporations to offer lower prices. But the whole economy slows down as part of the process.Everyone agrees that price increases result from a mismatch of supply and demand. The Fed s strategy is controversial. however. because the mismatch has been caused partly by supply problems that Powell has acknowledged cannot be fixed by interest rates. The current bout of inflation also stems partly from simple profiteering. as companies take advantage of consumers  continued willingness to pay higher prices. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard noted in a speech last month that it would  meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures  if corporations could accept slightly smaller profit margins. Powell didn t take any questions about corporate profits on Wednesday.Despite the growing criticism of the Fed. there s a bipartisan consensus that the central bank s strategy is sound. And the Fed has no shortage of high-profile supporters. such as Harvard University economist Larry Summers. who on Wednesday likened stopping the rate hikes to prematurely stopping a course of antibiotics. Powell said Wednesday that it s better for the Fed to hurt the economy too much. and then to try to heal it later. than to relent in its campaign against inflation. And he said that economic data have signaled that the economy needs more pain than previously thought. Job openings fell dramatically in August from near-record highs. for instance. but then rose again in September. according to the latest data this week.  Incoming data since our last meeting suggested that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected.  Powell said. Powell acknowledged that the odds of avoiding a recession — a so-called  soft landing  — have gone down. The inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year without question.  he said.  That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive. and that narrows the path to a soft landing. ,Politics News

A Tennessee woman has gone viral for her impassioned speech defending the LGBTQ community at a county board of trustees meeting last week.resignationFox resigned after months of backlash from certain community members over the library s Pride Month LGBTQ book display. He also upset some people by hosting a family-friendly drag brunch last year at a brewery he runs.The Daily Beast reported I ve never been sexually assaulted at a drag show. but I have been in church. twice.  Graham told the board.  The men in that church told me it was my fault. She denounced the  vile and disgusting  homophobic rhetoric taking root in the county.  I m sick of it!  she said.   Jesus didn t go anywhere and condemn people!  she said.  He did not ever walk into any place and spew hatred and lies and completely annihilate a group of human beings who just want to exist.  It is child abuse to immediately tell your child that he is wrong for feeling like he doesn t belong.  she added. Critics of the Pride Month display were reportedly unhappy that the LGBTQ books were in the same vicinity as the part of the library where children s books were kept. as well as an area where a children s free lunch program was taking place.In social media posts. opponents suggested the display was a threat to children and attacked Fox for supposedly pushing a  Gay Pride Month agenda  to minors.The library board accepted Fox s resignation. though it unanimously supported him staying on as director.Throughout Graham s speech. attendees at the meeting were heard applauding and cheering her on. Various videos of her remarks on social media have each been viewed over a million times.wage culture wars,Politics News

BUCKS COUNTY. Pa. ― It all started with COVID.When the coronavirus began spreading in the United States. the 23 schools in the Central Bucks School District were forced to shutter to keep students and staff safe. When students eventually returned to classrooms. they were still following safety measures like masking and social distancing.Many parents in the wealthy. majority-white Bucks County refused to accept the new reality — and they made their opposition known at school board meetings. We had this fairly active group that was coming in to make public comments. speaking at every meeting.  Karen Smith. who represents some of the towns that make up the district for the board. told HuffPost.  And they were adamantly opposed to wearing masks. The battles over masks and COVID safety measures — which Smith saw as commonsense steps to keep kids and staff safe — became so heated that they inspired her to become a Democrat after six years on the school board as a Republican.As time went on. Smith noticed school board meetings that were supposed to be about pandemic policies veering in very different directions: primarily. toward anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and panic over  critical race theory. Residents would come to public meetings and read excerpts from books they wanted to ban. cherry-picking explicit passages so they could accuse the libraries of having pornographic material. They take ‘Genderqueer  and they open it up to the page where there is a dildo blow job. but they don t talk about the rest of the book or what the book is even about.  Smith said. referring to Maia Kobabe s bestselling book that describes their journey to figuring out they re nonbinary.When the school board election rolled around in November 2021. and five seats were up for grabs. the divide was clear. Democratic candidates generally ran on COVID safety. while Republicans candidates bolstered their campaigns by claiming the mantle of  parental rights.  which included anti-masking. vitriol about gender identity and outrage about CRT. a college-level academic theory that conservatives claim is being taught in public schools and used to teach white children to hate themselves.The parental rights crowd won out. and the Central Bucks school board became a 6-3 conservative majority. With that came a tangled web of proposals designed to silence anyone who isn t white. straight. cisgender and conservative. including rules to dictate what teachers can wear and how students can express their gender identity and sexuality.Conservatives may be preaching about specific issues — like so-called sexually inappropriate library books being made available to students — but the whole movement is about destabilizing public institutions like schools.This dynamic is playing out in school districts across the country. especially in reliably red states. But in perennially purple Pennsylvania. the moral panic over social justice and books with LGBTQ themes is happening against the backdrop of critical midterm races that could determine the state s political leanings for years to come. Republican Mehmet Oz. a TV doctor who is vowing to fight cancel culture. is facing Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) in a tight Senate race. And for governor. far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano. a Christian nationalist who has advocated for banning books is up against Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro. About eight months after the conservative majority took over the school board. dozens of Bucks County residents gathered before a vote on Policy 109.2which lays out the criteria for removing books from school libraries and. critically. allows anyone in the district to challenge any book and potentially get it pulled from circulation.More than two dozen people made public comments during the meeting. mostly to voice their opposition to the proposed policy. An apology to the three of you who are trying your damnedest to live up to your oath and protect the lives of children.  English teacher Stephen Albert said to the Democrats on the board.  But to the majority: At long last. have you no sense of shame? The room erupted in applause.But the conservatives weren t swayed. and the policy passed. There was scattered applause in the room. as well as a few boos. Meeting attendees yelled  Shame!  and  Shame on you!  as they filed out. Look at the adults we have in the room.  a Republican board member said sarcastically. reprimanding the people opposed to the policy. Policy 109.2 was enacted in July. but educators. staff and residents are still waiting for the board to clarify who will be in charge of determining the fate of challenged books.Smith was one of the votes against the library proposal.  No. absolutely not.  she said when she stepped up to vote.The evidence of Smith s new liberal leanings are clear both inside and outside of her home: She has a big rainbow flag flying outside. pro-reading bumper stickers on her cars and a tote bag declaring  READ BANNED BOOKS  next to her desk. These are human rights issues and the rights of our students.  Smith said.  I m not going to be quiet about that. During the public comment section of one school board meeting last November. two residents made transphobic and antisemitic statements. Smith tried to cut off a man making antisemitic comments. but other board members pushed back and said she was infringing on residents  First Amendment rights. Many of those same conservative school board members were throwing their support behind the book-banning and censorship policy just a few months later.Kate Nazemi. who has two children in Central Bucks schools. is in staunch opposition to the new book policy. In September. she organized a parade against book banning.Like Smith. she noticed a shift on the school board when the pandemic began. When experts said masking and social distancing would keep staff and students safe. conservatives pushed back and said they were wrong. When school librarians chose books with care for their students. the conservative majority said those books were inappropriate or pornographic. I called it the COVID formula: Belittle the experts in the field. and then say we don t need to listen to them. we can figure it out our own way.  Nazemi said while sipping coffee in a busy cafe in Doylestown. the county seat.  There s this narrow worldview that is being applied to all 17.500 kids. It s limiting kids  access to books. materials and discussions in the classrooms.  she added.  How are these kids supposed to think critically about issues and develop as humans. if they are so limited in what they re able to read and discuss and learn?  Earlier this month. the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania filed a complaint against the school board on behalf of seven students. alleging widespread discrimination and hostility toward LGBTQ students. In the complaint. the lawyers say that the school board does things that actively harm LGBTQ students. including removing Pride flags and directing teachers not to use preferred names. They specifically call out the library book policy. saying it s  a thinly disguised effort to censor LGBTQ+-themed materials.  The school board president responded by asking the ACLU to reveal the names of the students filing the complaint.The U.S. Department of Education has opened up an investigation. The board members are not interested in a democracy.  Nazemi said.  What they want are either one of two things: public schools with Christian values. or public schools that fail so badly that we can then use our tax dollars to pay for private school. Some parents are worried that schools will be more likely to go down this path if Mastriano is in the governor s mansion.At an October hearing at the statehouse. parents from all over Pennsylvania testified in support of a parental rights bill that Mastriano had put forth. The bill says it aims to give parents more say in how public schools are run. but critics say it s an attempt to silence and bully LGBTQ students and families. His supporters showed up with campaign buttons on their clothing. Mastriano. who was present at the Jan. 6. 2021. riot but maintains he did not enter the U.S. Capitol building. is running a far-right campaign that aims to stoke fear of immigrants. liberals and transgender people among his fan base. What s happened to us where bureaucrats get to decide how your kids identify? Pronoun games have no place in schools.  Mastriano said at the statehouse forgetting that grammar is a core part of schooling.  This has to end. Madness has come in. Parents have the last say. period. parents expressed similar thoughts.  School administrators all over the country. including Pennsylvania. have decided parents should be excluded from vital conversations with regard to their child s education and well-being.  said Megan Brock. a parent from Bucks County. Democratic state Sen. Maria Collett represents the 12th District. which includes CBSD. She didn t participate in the parental rights bill hearing. even though she is a member of the state government committee. The people of the 12th District elected me to use my time. energy and resources to better their lives.  she said.  Not to legitimize horseshit.  She is unabashed in her criticism of the conservatives leading the charge in the outrage over books.  They distract. they deflect. and they make up a story about a boogeyman that is trying to lure your kid into an alley with a pornographic book.  Collett said from her office desk. which features a photo of herself and President Joe Biden.  They don t have answers to the problems that are plaguing Pennsylvania.  she added.  That s why they re so fixated on identity politics. Collett said her constituents aren t calling her to complain about library books or rainbow flags in schools — they re more worried about issues like Social Security benefits and unemployment plans.Evidence of the  anti-lockdown  to  critical race theory panic  to  book-banning  pipeline can be found all across the country. What began as the idea that wearing a mask was an affront to freedom morphed into a panic about teaching kids about racial privilege in the wake of George Floyd s murder. then seamlessly became an effort to censor books with racial justice or LGBTQ themes.The book bans came first as a trickle. then as a storm. According to PEN America. the past year saw a record number of book challenges in schools and libraries across the country. State lawmakers proposed bills and made lists of books they wanted to ban. parents claimed that schools and libraries were filled with sexually explicit books. and that anyone who didn t stand with them was aiding and abetting child abuse.Why are books in school libraries the latest target for conservative ire? Books are democratizing. They help students expand their worldview. And if your end goal is control over society by any means. having a well-read and well-educated public is not in your best interest.Although the Bucks County border is just 10 miles from Philadelphia. more than 80% of the 646.000 residents are white. The wealthy suburb typically leans Democratic. but the school board has lurched to the right in just one election cycle ― and some residents worry that the shift will only continue. especially considering Mastriano s influence on the state. Even if he loses the race. Mastriano and the CBSD are setting the stage for Pennsylvania to become a blueprint for conservatives in other states. not unlike how conservative education policies in Florida and Texas have provided a playbook for Pennsylvania s GOP.  We will still have like Mastriano-style politics here on the school board until the next election.  Nazemi said.And if Mastriano does win. the effects are sure to be felt across the state. On the campaign trail. he has vowed to turn Pennsylvania into the Florida of the north. We have one of the candidates saying. ‘I want to model us after a state we ve seen pass really damaging legislation that is hurting children. teachers and parents.   Collett said.  If we don t stand up and say. ‘No. not on my watch.  then we all become complicit. ,Politics News

PHOENIX (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday ordered armed members of a group monitoring ballot drop boxes in Arizona to stay at least 250 feet away from the locations following complaints that people wearing masks and carrying guns were intimidating voters.U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said members of Clean Elections USA. its leader and anyone working with them are also barred from filming or following anyone within 75 feet (23 meters) of a ballot drop box or the entrance to a building that houses one. They also cannot speak to or yell at individuals within that perimeter unless spoken to first.The temporary restraining order was requested by the League of Women Voters of Arizona after Clean Elections USA. encouraged people to watch 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County. Arizona s most populous county. It is paramount that we balance the rights of the defendant to engage in their constitutionally protected First Amendment activity with the interest in the plaintiffs and in voters casting a vote free of harassment and intimidation.  Liburdi said.A second set of defendants in rural Yavapai County — groups known as the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness team. who are associated with the far-right anti-government group Oath Keepers — were dismissed from the case on Monday after they pledged to stand down their operations.Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people. some armed. watching 24-hour ballot boxes in the two counties as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained alleging voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos. and followed voters.Sheriff s deputies have been providing security around the two outdoor drop boxes in Maricopa County after a pair of people carrying guns and wearing bulletproof vests showed up at a box in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. The county s other 24-hour outdoor drop box is at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in downtown Phoenix. which is now surrounded by a chain link fence.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. a Republican. has called on voters to immediately report any intimidation to police and file a complaint with his office. Arizona s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs last week said her office received six cases of potential voter intimidation to the state attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice. as well as a threatening email sent to the state elections director.The U.S. attorney s office in Arizona has vowed to prosecute any violations of federal law but said local police were at the  front line in efforts to ensure that all qualified voters are able to exercise their right to vote free of intimidation or other election abuses. The temporary order issued by Liburdi on Tuesday will be in effect for two weeks and the cooperation from the monitoring group  shall not be construed as an admission they have engaged in any of these activities.  the judge added.The 250 foot (76 meter) perimeter around drop boxes also applies to group members wearing body armor.Other stipulations include the groups post on their websites and social media that it is untrue that dropping off multiple ballots is illegal in all cases. Exceptions are allowed for family members. members of the same household and caregivers.Alexander Kolodin. the lead attorney for the defendants. said the League of Women Voters of Arizona ultimately failed to completely shut down the monitors  mission. Still. the groups are not happy about the limits. since he said they could prevent them from discouraging ballot box stuffing. They re worried they can t record what happens within the 75 feet. They may have missed an opportunity to deter unlawful conduct.  Kolodin said.  Today s order may make drop box voting a little less secure. An Associated Press review this summerThe League of Women Voters of Arizona encouraged voters to keep using the drop boxes. Today s U.S. District Court decision is a victory for the voters of Arizona who have the right to cast their ballots free from intimidation. threats. or coercion.  Pinny Sheoran. the group s president. said in a statement.This lawsuit was folded into another case before Liburdi.the judge said Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.  the judge wrote.Liburdi concluded that  while this case certainly presents serious questions. the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.  The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society. a conservative legal organization.Department of Justice on MondayLuke Cilano. a Lions of Liberty board member. said the organization had dropped its  Operation Drop Box  initiative last Wednesday  due to being lumped in with people who don t adhere to the law and our rules of engagement. The Lions of Liberty are not associated with Clean Elections USA. he said. They are connected to the Yavapai County Preparedness Team. But he says the team was not involved in ballot box monitoring. 2000 Mules There s no evidence for the notion that a network of Democrat-associated ballot  mules  has conspired to collect and deliver ballots to drop boxes. either in the 2020 presidential vote or in the upcoming midterm elections.___This story has been corrected to show that the order does not apply to the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness Team. groups that were dismissed as defendants Monday after agreeing to stop their activities at drop boxes.____https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionshttps://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections,Politics News
With days to go before the midterm elections. a funny thing is happening with GOP congressional candidates in Oregon: They re pretending they re moderate. reasonable people after months of fueling election conspiracies in plain sight.Take Alek Skarlatos. For the last year and a half. he s refused to say that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. fair and square.He had  no comment  in May 2021 when asked who he believed won the election. He was asked again last month to  state without equivocation who won the 2020 presidential election.  He wouldn t. Instead. he said only that Biden is the president. without addressing the validity of the election ― a common dog whistle among Republicans who don t want to anger former President Donald Trump s base of supporters by saying Biden fairly beat him.in May 2021at least seven people dead$1.5 million of damageRepublicansin competitive racesA quick review of Skarlatos  Twitter feed shows that he s been liking posts that suggest the 2020 election was stolen. a lie pushed by Trump after he lost.Among the tweets Skarlatos has liked in recent months: an August tweet that states  The FBI rigged the 2020 election.  a July tweet fueling a conspiracy theory that a federal informant staged the Jan. 6 insurrection. another July tweet fueling that same conspiracy theory. and a June tweet mocking whistleblowers as  con artists  and  professional liars  who credibly testified about Trump s abuse of power against Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and about Trump s efforts to instigate the Jan. 6 insurrection.But when HuffPost asked Skarlatos last week if he believed that Trump won the election or that the FBI rigged it. he responded as if the question was absurd. Let me be clear: Joe Biden won the 2020 election.  Skarlatos said in a statement.  And like Barack Obama. if he offered me a meeting in the Oval Office. I would accept that invitation to discuss solutions to help our country.  I also oppose all violent protests.  he added.  including Black Lives Matter and January 6th. Skarlatos  mention of Obama is intentional: He s featured the former Democratic president in his ads to suggest he is moderate. Skarlatos. a former Army National Guardsman. met Obama in 2015. after he and two friends stopped a terrorist on a Paris-bound train. At the time. Obama said the three  represent the very best of America. But Obama s team last month publicly rejected Skarlatos  ads. calling them  purposely misleading  and saying Skarlatos is  deeply out of step  with Obama s positions on climate change and the Affordable Care Act.Fellow Oregon GOP congressional candidate Lori Chavez-DeRemer has spent months casting doubts on Biden s 2020 win and on the events of Jan. 6 ― and would like you to forget about all that now. She s in a dead heat with Democrat Jamie McLeod-Skinner.In a Q&A published last week with Oregon Public Broadcasting. Chavez-DeRemer was asked directly if she believes there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. She wouldn t answer. Instead. like Skarlatos. she said only that Biden is the president.She wouldn t give a clear answer back in April either. when OPB asked her if she believed Biden won in 2020. I think that there s some question to what people felt.  Chavez-DeRemer said. despite there being zero evidence of widespread voter fraud.  People were. at least voters I talked to. they felt like it was unusual. She avoided answering the question yet again in an April story in The Oregonian. when asked if she agreed Biden was the winner of the 2020 election. The fact that there are millions of Americans that doubt the integrity of the 2020 election should concern all of us.  she said.  According to the Heritage Foundation. Oregon is ranked 48th in the nation in election integrity.  (Oregon leaders are actually very proud of their long-established mail-in voting system.)Chavez-DeRemer has also appeared to sympathize with the Jan. 6 insurrectionists and blamed the press for playing a role in the attack that day. When you feel like your vote no longer matters and you re being disenfranchised as an American. and we have a protected right for people [sic] peaceful protesting. we should have been allowed to do so.  she said of the rioters behind the attempted coup. during an April candidate debate.  So I think the media had something to do with all of that. What is  even more shocking  than an attempted coup. she added. is that some of the rioters may have been held in jail without due process. (All of the Jan. 6 defendants were arraigned and had bail hearings. so it s not clear what violations she s referring to).a combative debate last month What I do not believe are the attacks on our democracy that she has supported.  said McLeod-Skinner. referring to Chavez-DeRemer.  She has supported the Jan. 6 insurrectionists who attacked our Capitol. resulting in the death of several Capitol police officers.  That s just nonsense.  Chavez-DeRemer replied. without addressing any of the previous claims she s made on this topic.  That s an outright lie. When McLeod-Skinner again accused her of sympathizing with the Capitol rioters. Chavez-DeRemer replied.  It s an outright lie. I just can t even believe that you say that. I don t even know where you got that from. Their debate ended with Chavez-DeRemer saying of course she believes that Biden is the president. which. again. is not the same thing as saying the election was legitimate and free of widespread fraud. which it was. We know that President Biden is the president of these United States.  said Chavez-DeRemer.  I know that. My opponent knows that. McLeod-Skinner pointed out that. again. with Chavez-DeRemer s choice of words.  There was reference to Biden. but never an acknowledgement he actually won. Chavez-DeRemer s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether she believes Biden fairly won the 2020 presidential election. on what she meant when she said the people behind the attempted coup had a right to peacefully protest. and why she thinks the media had something to do with causing the violent attack.Then there s Oregon s GOP congressional candidate Mike Erickson. who is really hoping people don t remember how much he used to prioritize the issue of election fraud.Erickson. an enthusiastic Trump supporter. prominently featured language about election fraud on his website ― until he won his primary in mid-May. at which point he scrubbed all of it.A web archive of his homepage from late April shows that it used to list  guaranteeing free elections that are untainted by fraud  as a top priority.

Fox Newsa new studycould benefit from campus interactionsOn Tuesday s broadcast of  Outnumbered.  co-host Emily Compagno kicked off the panel s freakout over the findings by snarking that college students have it  so rough these days.  From climate anxiety to just the idea of a conservative speaker on campus. it is all so stressful.  Compagno sniped.  Well now. thankfully. a new study has found that interventions with cats on campuses may help stressed-out students. I guess the taxpayers picking up their student loan tab wasn t enough. It was  just another example of how we are raising snowflakes.  chimed in Julie Banderas. who went on to suggest that people who need emotional support animals may be better off dropping out of college. I don t think these kids need cats. I think they need discipline. I think they need a slap in the face.  Compagno responded. before pivoting to a slew of right-wing talking points. These are the same kids that get a professor fired for being too hard on their way to medical school. These are kids that can t even listen to a conservative viewpoint. They shout out speakers. They chase them off campus.  she said.  But a cat will make everything better. That doesn t work in the real world. Kayleigh McEnany. a former White House press secretary for Donald Trump and now an anchor on the conservative network. called the concept of students petting cats  a distraction for kids who don t want to study.  I don t need to be coddling a puppy. I need my organic chemistry book — this is insanity.  McEnany declared.  Give me a cup of coffee. a cookie. a stack of books and I m set.

Joe BidenDonald TrumpDemocratsmidterm electionIn a final-week sprint for Democrats before Election Day. Biden will campaign in New Mexico on Thursday. California on Friday and Pennsylvania on Saturday.By many accounts. Democratic control of Congress and several statehouses is in peril. and Biden is trying to stem that tide.In Florida. a state famously popular among retirees. he focused on federal programs for elderly people and the less well-to-do. He declared that the current crop of GOP candidates  ain t your father s Republican party  and said that he prayed God would deliver his opponents  some enlightenment. gubernatorial candidate Charlie CristCrist and Senate candidate Val Demings.At the event for Crist. Biden made the stakes personal against DeSantis. a major adversary of the Biden White House. Biden suggested DeSantis was just another version of former President Trump and criticized him for  demonizing the LGBTQ population.  This to me is one of the most important races in the country.  Biden said.  Charlie is running against Donald Trump incarnate. wouldn t commit Governor DeSantis only cares about the White House. he doesn t give a damn about your house.  Crist told the audience.doing a  good job But Tuesday in Florida. Biden took shots at DeSantis.At one point. during his evening remarks at Florida Memorial. Biden recalled that Crist — who previously served as governor from 2007 to 2011 as a Republican —  was a great governor before and will make an even greater governor again because of who he is going to be replacing. Minutes later. Biden noted that the nearby Port of Miami recently received a $16 million federal grant due to one of his biggest legislative wins: the $1 trillion infrastructure legislation. He then pivoted toward DeSantis. I m sure your governor will take credit for it somewhere along the line.  Biden said.The president also blasted Republicans who made light of the attack against Paul Pelosi. the husband of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He asked how such a political assault could happen and  nobody in that party condemns it for exactly what it is. In Hallandale Beach. he dinged Demings  Republican Senate opponent. incumbent Marco Rubio. for failing to back his Inflation Reduction Act. passed in August by the Democratic-led Congress.It includes several health care provisions popular among elderly people and the less well-off. including a $2.000 cap on out-of-pocket medical expenses and a $35 monthly cap per prescription of insulin. It requires companies that raise prices faster than overall inflation to pay Medicare a rebate. Not one single Republican voted for it in the United States Senate.  Biden told a crowd at a Hallandale Beach community center.  Every single solitary Republican in Congress voted against these savings. including Sen. Rubio. Biden s appearances with Crist and Demings came after some of the Democrats  most embattled candidates. including Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. have opted not to appear with him.Still. the president s advisers insist he can be helpful by talking about GOP policies they believe voters find objectionable.Meanwhile. Republicans are bullish on their prospects across Florida as voter registration trends and demographic shifts suggest the state will continue moving to the right.Democrats are particularly concerned about the trend in Miami-Dade County. home to 1.5 million Hispanics of voting age. It has been a Democratic stronghold for the past 20 years. but the GOP made significant gains in the past presidential election. Republicans. including Lt. Gov.

Nancy PelosiDavid DePape was ordered held without bail during his arraignment Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court. His public defender entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. It was the first public appearance since the early Friday attack for DePape. a fringe activist drawn to conspiracy theories.In court papers filed Tuesday. prosecutors detailed the attack in stark terms as part of their bid to keep DePape behind bars. Paul Pelosi was knocked unconscious by the hammer attack and woke up in a pool of his own blood. the filing said.DePape allegedly said he had other targets. including a local professor as well as several prominent state and federal politicians – and members of their families. This case demands detention.  Jenkins wrote in the court filing.  Nothing less. Wearing orange jail clothing. DePape only spoke to tell Judge Diane Northway how to pronounce his last name (dih-PAP ). The 42-year-old defendant is scheduled to return to court Friday.After the hearing. DePape s public defender Adam Lipson said he looks forward to providing DePape with a  vigorous defense.  He also said he met DePape on Monday night for the first time and had not seen the police reports yet. We re going to be doing a comprehensive investigation of what happened. We re going to be looking into Mr. DePape s mental state. and I m not going to talk any further about that until I have more information.  said Lipson. who noted that a no-bail detainer in state court is a moot point because DePape also has been placed on a federal hold in the case.He later said he was pleased that Paul Pelosi was improving and expected to make a full recovery. adding he urged the public  not to pass judgment on what he called a complicated situation.  From experience. I can say that there s always more to the story than what is initially reported.  he said. noting  there are a lot of rumors and speculation about this incident that will need to be sorted out in court once we review the evidence.  Mr. DePape is entitled to a vigorous legal defense. and we intend to give him one.  he added.He also said DePape s shoulder was dislocated during his arrest and that he was wearing a sling under his jail clothing during the hearing.The Pelosi family had asked for a Zoom link to be able to watch Tuesday s proceedings but the judge said she did not get the request ahead of time.midterm electionsThreats against lawmakersDePape faces state charges of attempted murder. burglary and elder abuse.

TwitterElon MuskMusk has said he won t make major decisions about content or restoring banned accounts before setting up a  content moderation council  with diverse viewpoints. But his own behavior as a prolific tweeter has signaled otherwise.He s engaged directly with figures on the political right who are appealing for looser restrictions. including a Republican candidate for Arizona secretary of state who credits Musk with enabling him to begin tweeting again after his account was briefly suspended Monday.Musk even changed his profile to  Twitter Complaint Hotline Operator  — with a photo of himself when he was a toddler holding a telephone. But it is almost impossible for those outside of Twitter to know what strings he is pulling or whose accounts have been suspended: The company has stopped responding to media questions. except for the few that Musk answers by tweet.started last week on his first full day as Twitter s owner.It continued when the daughter of Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson. whose provocative critiques of  politically correct  culture and feminism are popular with some right-wing activists. appealed for Musk to restore her father s account after a tweet about transgender actor Elliot Page that apparently ran afoul of Twitter s rules on hateful conduct. Anyone suspended for minor & dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail.  Musk pledged. He had months earlier said in reference to Peterson that Twitter was  going way too far in squashing dissenting opinions. pay $8 for a coveted verified blue check markThe check mark has been criticized as a symbol of elitism on the platform. But its primary purpose has been to verify that accounts in the public eye — such as politicians. brands and journalists — are who they say they are. It s been a tool to prevent impersonation and help stem the flow of misinformation.a flood of online toxicitycontained baseless rumorsNancy PelosiIn a text exchange with The Associated Press. Mark Finchem. the Republican running to become Arizona s secretary of state. said his access to the platform was restored quickly after reaching out to Musk via his personal Twitter handle. Asked why his account was suspended. Finchem said:  Perhaps you should reach out to Elon Musk. We were banned for an unknown reason. we reached out to him and 45 minutes later we were reinstated. Finchem. who questions the results of the 2020 presidential election and was at the Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021. has drawn national attention for his statements about election security and his ability to change election rules if he wins the state s top election post next week.Donald Trump Thank you @elonmusk for stopping the commie who suspended me from Twitter a week before the election.  Finchem wrote in the Tweet.  Twitter is much better with you at the helm. Jared Holt. a senior research manager at The Institute for Strategic Dialogue. said big social media companies have typically operated on the whims of their owners. But  that problem is especially glaring when somebody like Elon Musk takes the reins and kind of establishes himself as king of the platform. rather than an owner trying to run a coherent business.  Holt said.At the same time. Musk has sent mixed signals about his intentions. Despite overt examples of appealing to conservative calls and complaints about Twitter s policies. there s also plenty of evidence that the platform s policies on combating misinformation are still in effect. Separately. Musk has defended Twitter s ongoing head of trust and safety. Yoel Roth. after some conservative users called for his firing over past comments expressing liberal views.Roth remained on the job this week after other top executives were fired or resigned. And apart from Musk. he appeared to be the chief public voice of Twitter s content moderation. explaining that the company spent the weekend working to remove a  surge in hateful conduct  following Musk s takeover. We ve all made some questionable tweets. me more than most. but I want to be clear that I support Yoel.  Musk tweeted in response to a complaint from another conservative commentator.  My sense is that he has high integrity. and we are all entitled to our political beliefs. Some longtime Twitter observers have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of Musk s planned content moderation council. In part. that s because Twitter already has a trust and safety advisory council to address moderation questions. Truly I can t imagine how it would differ.  said Danielle Citron. a University of Virginia law professor who sits on the council and has been working with Twitter since 2009 to tackle online harms. such as threats and stalking.  Our council has the full spectrum of views on free speech.

Alexandra Rojas. executive director of Justice Democrats. said in a statement.unsuccessfully trying All we re doing is opposing a future anti-Israel squad member.  the spokesperson. Patrick Dorton. told HuffPost.  One race in a Democratic district in Pittsburgh is not going to determine control of the House. Elections in the 12th should be sleepy: President Joe Biden would have won the district. which includes parts of Pittsburgh and its suburbs. by roughly 20 percentage points in 2020. But the Republican nominee in the seat happens to be named Mike Doyle — the name of the retiring Democratic congressman who represented much of the area for over two decades.The possibility of voter confusion over Doyle s identity. along with the post-redistricting inclusion of some deeply conservative areas in the district and the generally sour political environment. has led some Democrats to fret about the seat. only adding to House Democrats  problems in a midterm election year when they are heavily favored to lose control of the chamber. United Democracy Project said their polling of the race found the contest to be competitive. As a super PAC. United Democracy Project can raise and spend unlimited sums provided it does not directly coordinate with candidates. It s received multimillion-dollar donations from Republicans. including Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and hedge fund manager Paul Elliott. but also has the backing of Democratic media executive Haim Saban. in a tweetDorton shot back. contending Sanders was simply bitter about losing two of his progressive allies. both of whom lost primaries in which UDP spent heavily against them.  Bernie and others on the fringe left are running a smear campaign against us because they re mad Andy Levin and Donna Edwards lost.  he said.National Democrats still consider a GOP win in the district unlikely but are concerned enough that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee plans to spend six figures on a coordinated advertising buy to help lock up the race. On Tuesday night. the DCCC threw some cold water on worries about Lee s standing. releasing an internal poll showing Lee leading Doyle 54% to 40% among likely voters. The survey. which was conducted on Sunday and Monday by the committee s analytics department. found little difference between Lee s standing and the generic congressional ballot. which clocked in at 57% Democrat to 38% Republican.Lee s campaign first became concerned about GOP attacks when the Congressional Leadership Fund. a super PAC controlled by allies of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. began airing an ad attacking Democrat Chris DeLuzio for contributing to one of Lee s state legislative campaigns. DeLuzio. who is in a tight race in a neighboring district. is the nominal target of the ad. which features a video clip of Lee declaring.  policing as we know it is no longer necessary.  But the spot is airing in the Pittsburgh media market. which includes both Lee and DeLuzio s districts.mailerThe television ad the group is airing hits similar notes. From hitting Lee as disloyal to aiding GOP attempts to defeat her. the turnaround was not lost on national progressives. many of whom have long hoped to distance the party from AIPAC s hardline. unquestioning support of Israel s occupation of Palestine.  It s crazy that AIPAC spent money in the primary calling Summer Lee a bad Democrat and is now spending money against her and helping election deniers.  said Adam Green. the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.  Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leadership need to speak out against this. This can t be the new normal. UDP attacked her during her comeback bidmore than $500.000UDP is open about supporting candidates in both parties who share its view that the United States should grant Israel discretion regarding how to approach its security concerns. By that logic. attacking Lee as a disloyal Democrat in a primary — and later working to sink her against a Republican — is a legitimate way to dispatch with a political adversary. We re a single-issue organization.  Dorton said.  We support Democrats and Republicans that are pro-Israel. Lee has said little about U.S. policy in Israel and the Palestinian territories. She does not support the Boycott. Divestment. and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. Still. she supports leveraging U.S. aid to pressure the Israeli government to end its occupation of Palestinian lands conquered in 1967.However. her greatest offense in the eyes of right-leaning pro-Israel groups is being affiliated with the left wing of the Democratic Party. first-ever super PACbeat backIf elected. Lee is expected to make common cause with the  Squad  of left-wing House Democrats whose ranks include Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib are the only two BDS supporters in Congress. Sure enough. Reps. Omar and Tlaib — as well as fellow  Squad  Reps. Jamaal Bowman (N.Y.). Ayanna Pressley (Mass.). and Cori Bush (Mo.) — co-hosted an online fundraiser for Lee on Sunday evening.  She is being warmly embraced by some of the most vehement. anti-Israel members of Congress.  Dorton said.  She is looking forward to being part of the anti-Israel ‘Squad  group of Democrats in the House. AIPAC had already raised cries of outrage on the left for its endorsement of more than 100 congressional Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. J Street. a more liberal pro-Israel group. reiterated criticism of that decision on Monday. At a critical moment for American democracy. with election denial. antisemitism and far-right extremism on the rise. AIPAC continues to make clear that its top political priority is to target and defeat progressive Democrats.  Laura Birnbaum. J Street s national political director. said in a statement.AIPAC notes that it has also endorsed 148 Democratic House candidates. That list of endorsees includes Democrats locked in competitive general elections. including Reps. Elaine Luria (Va.). Vicente Gonzalez (Texas). Susie Lee (Nev.). Steven Horsford (Nev.). and North Carolina state Sen. Don Davis. who is running for an open House seat. Those endorsements come with donations from AIPAC s political action committee and bundled individual contributions from AIPAC activists. We are proud of our political involvement in supporting pro-Israel candidates — both Democrats and Republicans — and opposing detractors of America s alliance with the Jewish state such as Sumner Lee.  Marshall Wittmann. spokesperson for AIPAC. said.  An important aspect of our political involvement has shown that being pro-Israel is completely consistent with progressive values. Wittmann added:  We will continue to work to build broad bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.  What makes UDP s intervention in the race new and notable. however. is that unlike AIPAC s formal endorsements of Republicans. this spending could determine control of the House. While bundling donations can help members win reelection. super PAC spending on attack ads — not subject to standard contribution limits — is a far more direct intervention.That raises the question of whether top Democrats like Pelosi — and the many Democratic incumbents and candidates on the receiving end of UDP s largesse — will speak up against UDP s opposition to Lee.more than $2 millionWhen asked whether UDP is concerned about how its spending choices could affect its relationship with Pelosi and other top Democrats. Dorton declined to comment. remained silentSenior Democrats  refusal to speak up now about UDP is especially galling to progressives whom the Democratic establishment has admonished for mounting primary campaigns against sitting Democrats and otherwise failing to demonstrate adequate party loyalty.

abortionThe study. which waspublished Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. analyzed requests for medication abortion across 30 Republican-leaning states using data from Aid Access. an Austria-based telemedicine service that mails abortion pills to people in the U.S.Researchers found that requests for the pills ― already the most common abortion method in the U.S. ― went from an average of 83 per day to 137 per day after the court s draft decision on abortion access was leaked to the public in May. In the two months after the court released its formal decision in June. those requests averaged around 214 per day. Every state. regardless of abortion policy. showed a higher request rate during the periods after the leak and after the formal decision announcement. with the largest increases observed in states enacting total bans.  the researchers found. with Louisiana. Mississippi. Arkansas. Alabama and Oklahoma seeing the biggest upticks. In states that enacted total abortion bans. patients overwhelmingly said they were seeking out medication abortion because of laws stopping them from terminating pregnancies. Sixty-two percent of patients who requested abortion pills after the court s decision cited  current abortion restrictions  as their reason for needing them. compared to 31% before the leak.as abortion providers warned would happenRequests for medication abortion have skyrocketed even though many states have made it illegal to provide them. But Aid Access has been able to circumvent this. The group uses only doctors in Europe to provide virtual abortion care for patients in states that ban the pills. and those doctors face little legal risk for violating a U.S. state law from outside the country. U.S. patients can receive the pills in one to three weeks for about $100.state laws against medication abortion61 cases,Politics News

U.S. Capitol Police is requesting more resources in order to better protect lawmakers. in response to a man assaulting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s husband after breaking into their California home to try to hurt her.Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger released a statement on Tuesday stressing the urgent need to escalate security for members of Congress given the increasingly violent political environment. Manger brought up how the agency made security improvements after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) and the 2017 shooting of Rep.

A federal affidavit said DePape told police he wanted to hold the speaker hostage and  break her kneecaps.  so her visible injuries would send a warning to other members of Congress.The attack came just over a week before tense midterm elections. in which a number of fringe candidates are running for office and instigating such violence. The assault has already been mocked in conservative and far-right media and used as a talking point on crime by even some senior Republican leaders. Many Republican lawmakers have refused to condemn the violence and conspiracy theories around it.Manger said the Capitol Police department has implemented several improvements to security since followers of Donald Trump stormed the building on Jan. 6. 2021. to try to overturn the election Joe Biden won. Part of that security plan involves strengthening Capitol Police s partnership with law enforcement agencies across the country to provide security for lawmakers when they are traveling outside Washington. Manger said that assistance is  crucial  to ensure lawmakers  safety. During this time of heightened political tension. we continue to monitor thousands of cases across the country — in an effort to stop potential threats before they make headlines.  Manger said. adding that in the past five years. about 12% of cases in which Capitol Police identified someone making threats have been prosecuted. Federal prosecutors have charged DePape with influencing. impeding or retaliating against a federal official by threatening or injuring a family member. He is also federally charged with attempted kidnapping of a U.S. official on account of the performance of official duties. DePape is expected to face state criminal charges as well after he was arrested Friday on suspicion of attempted murder. elder abuse and burglary. The USCP is working tirelessly to keep everyone safe during this tense time in American politics.  Manger said.  We understand the urgency of today s challenges and remain committed to our mission. ,Politics News
Lindsey GrahamGeorgia investigationDonald TrumpThe court left no legal impediments in the way of Graham s appearance before a special grand jury. now scheduled for Nov. 17.GrahamThe South Carolina senator. a top Trump ally. had argued that a provision of the Constitution. the speech and debate clause. shields him from being forced to testify.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had told the justices that  the delay resulting from a stay would be unavoidably harmful  to the grand jury investigation.Lower courts had rebuffed Graham s pleatemporary hold that Justice Clarence Thomas had placed on the testimonyJoe BidenWillis wants to question Graham about two phone calls he made to Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election.During those calls. Graham asked about  reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump.  Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony.Graham also  made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia. consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign.  she wrote. She said in a hearing last month that Graham may be able to provide insight into the extent of any coordinated efforts to influence the results.Raffensperger said he took Graham s question about absentee ballots as a suggestion to toss out legally cast votes. Graham has dismissed that interpretation as  ridiculous.  Graham has also argued that the call was protected because he was asking questions to inform his decisions on voting to certify the 2020 election and future legislation.Lower courts already have told Willis that she  may not ask about any investigatory conduct.  which is protected under the Constitution.The justices wrote Tuesday that their intervention is unnecessary because the courts  have held that Senator Graham may not be questioned about such activities. He also can return to federal court if disputes arise over the questioning in front of the grand jury. the justices wrote.Thomas initially dealt with Graham s appeal. but involved the rest of the court in Tuesday s order. as is customary.Virginia  Ginni  ThomasGinni Thomas. a conservative activist and staunch Trump supporter. attended the Jan. 6  Stop the Steal  rally on the Ellipse and wrote to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks following the election encouraging him to work to overturn President Joe Biden s victory and keep Trump in office.She also contacted lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election. though no evidence has emerged that she contacted Georgia officials.she stood by the false claim,Politics News

second woman to accuseHershel WalkerThe woman alleged last week that Walker. the staunchly anti-abortion Republican nominee in the Georgia Senate race. had pressured her to end a pregnancy. The woman did not share her name or show her face at last week s press conference. saying she was protecting her identity  for fear of reprisal against myself. my family and my livelihood.  The woman appeared on camera for the first time during an interview that aired Tuesday on ABC s  Good Morning America.  The woman ― who was referred to as Jane Doe and remains anonymous ― said she got pregnant in 1993 during a six-year affair with Walker. At the time. the former NFL star was living with his wife in Dallas and playing for the Cowboys. He  was very clear that he did not want me to have the child.  the woman told  Good Morning America.   And he said that because of his wife s family and powerful people around him that I would not be safe and that the child would not be safe. Walker has denied the allegations that he paid for abortions. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new interview.The woman said she didn t want to go through with the procedure. but that Walker talked her into it. She said she felt  threatened  and  manipulated.  He came to my house and picked me up and drove me to the clinic.  she said shakily.  I went in alone and he waited in the car while I went in and had the procedure. And then I came out and he drove me to the drugstore. and then he took me home. She said Walker gave her cash to pay for it. Afterward.  everything shifted. He distanced himself from me almost immediately.  the woman said.She provided evidence to support her claims. including photos of the two together and letters and cards signed with Walker s signature flourish of the letter H.Donald TrumpWalker is unfit to be a U.S. senator because  honesty matters.  she said on  Good Morning America. another woman said Walker reimbursed her for the procedureend a second pregnancyRepublicans have maintained their support for Walker and polling shows the Georgia race to be extremely tight despite the mountain of scandals amassed during the candidate s campaign.

In June. Wyoming s secretary of state came out forcefully against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell s effort to spread lies about the 2020 election. Then-Secretary of State Ed Buchanan (R) said Lindell was  NOT the purveyor of election integrity truth  but rather a  peddler of pillows and promises.  Buchanan quoted Socrates and painstakingly detailed all of the ways Lindell had avoided providing any evidence of his claims.  No credible candidate for any office in Wyoming can say that Wyoming lacks election integrity.  Buchanan said. Things have changed in the state. Buchanan left the office last month for a state judgeship. leaving behind an interim secretary. Now. the race to become Wyoming s top election official is uncontested: State Rep. Chuck Gray (R). a Donald Trump-endorsed election denier who has referred to the 2020 race as  clearly rigged.  is next in line for the job.Gray is part of a wave of red state candidates for top election jobs who are bringing Trump s election lies with them into office. Outside of nationwide media attention and the checks of a bipartisan state government. they may end up with more political leverage to act on Trump s lies than others in more closely watched states like Michigan and Nevada. In Indiana. Republican Secretary of State candidate Diego Morales has denounced the 2020 election as a  scam  and called for  every Hoosier vote in-person  with only limited exceptions. In Wisconsin ― which could elect a veto-proof Republican legislative majority this year ― Republican Amy Loudenbeck has campaigned on taking election authorities away from the state s bipartisan election commission. and gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has said there were  certainly illegal ballots  in 2020. In Wyoming. Gray is the clearest example of what those beliefs would mean in practice. As a state legislator. he wanted Wyoming to join Texas  lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election results. as a candidate. he has held screenings of the repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory film  2000 Mules.  saying it  clearly demonstrated how the woke. big tech left has stolen elections with ballot drop boxes.  He has promised to ban drop boxes as secretary of state. claiming they  open up our elections to ballot harvesting fraud.  And. after a visit to the shambolic  audit  of 2020 votes in the Phoenix area ― a review that found no fraud. but did somewhat inexplicably examine ballot paper for bamboo fibers ― Gray pushed to give the Wyoming legislature audit authority and signed a letter saying the election had been plagued by  corruption and mismanagement.  calling for the results to be decertified where they were  inaccurate.  Some of Wyoming s clerks. who administer elections at the county level and work closely with the secretary of state. are bracing for impact.  It does make it difficult at times when somebody questions your integrity.  said Malcolm Ervin. the clerk of Platte County and president of the state s County Clerks Association. Ervin said he has spoken to Gray and that he was hopeful Wyoming s county clerks could keep up their already-close relationship with the secretary of state s office. But one fact is unavoidable: None of Wyoming s county clerks think the state s elections have been tainted by fraud.  We just hope that we have the opportunity to convince him that in Wyoming. at least. there were no administration issues in 2020 or any election before or since.  Ervin said. Others aren t so optimistic.In August. the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported that unnamed Republicans had approached the political consultant Rebekah Fitzgerald in an unsuccessful effort to scout candidates for an independent challenge to Gray. And Gray s colleagues in the legislature even considered removing election responsibilities from the secretary of state s office altogether. in favor of sending them instead to an office overseen by multiple state officials.  The alarm bells went off for most everybody who doesn t share the belief that the 2020 election was stolen.  said state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer (R). the co-chair of the legislature s joint elections committee who authored the proposal and has been Gray s colleague in the Wyoming House for five years.  It was the first time in anyone s memory that you actually had someone running to be the secretary of state who doesn t believe in the sanctity of the election and that things were above board. Gray s not alone in his red state election denialism: In April. three months after Joe Biden took office. Morales. Indiana s GOP secretary of state nominee. wrote.  If we count every legal vote. President Trump won this election.  A year later. he referred to the election as  the wound that will not heal until it is honestly addressed.  Morales — who previously worked as a staffer in the Indiana governor s office when Mike Pence. Trump s vice president. led the state — has also called for cutting Indiana s early voting days in half. requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote. and creating a task force to investigate  shenanigans.  the Associated Press reported. It is not voter suppression. it is just common sense. we need to limit absentee ballots.  he told Steve Bannon in January.In Wisconsin. Republican Secretary of State nominee Loudenbeck has not been as explicit with her pronouncements about the last election.she said last yearduring a radio interviewMost important for Wisconsinites. Loudenbeck has campaigned on transferring some responsibility from the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to the secretary of state s office. even though Wisconsin Republicans previously stripped the office of most of its authority. she told Wisconsin Public Radiotold NBC Newsface criminal chargesa veto-proof supermajorityneck-and-neckhas saidfalsely saidtold PBS WisconsinIn Wyoming.

There is a chance that the economy will slide into recession next year and that Congress won t do anything to help. The Federal Reserve has been trying to tame inflation by deliberately slowing down the whole economy. So far the labor market has proved resilient and unemployment remains low. but the central bank s efforts could eventually result in millions of layoffs. Normally. when the economy sours and the unemployment rate rises. Congress temporariladds extra weeks of federal unemployment compensation to supplement the standard six months of benefits provided by states. The extra spending shores up people s finances and also helps prop up the economy as a whole. But it s not clear Congress would uphold that tradition if Republicans control the House of Representatives. which polls suggest is a likely outcome of the Nov. 8 midterm elections.  The Republican narrative is that when government helps people. we make them lazy.  Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) told HuffPost. Beyer has been one of the top proponents of overhauling the state-federal unemployment system so that more workers are covered and states have less leeway to slash benefits. Beyer and like-minded Democrats also favored a system that would automatically augment benefits in bad economic times. But Democrats did not include changes to the unemployment system when they considered broader changes to the social safety net. We lost that battle.  Beyer said.  It s not in the law right now. So I think [the tradition of extending benefits] is pretty much at risk if. in the worst case. Republicans take back the House.  The three Republican lawmakers ― Vern Buchanan (Fla.). Jason Smith (Mo.) and Adrian Smith (Neb.) ― vying to be chair of the House Ways and Means Committee in a GOP-controlled House have not laid out an agenda for unemployment insurance. which is one of the programs the committee oversees. Their spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. House Republicans have. however. signaled they ll go all out next year to cut federal spending. suggesting they d even demand cuts to Social Security and Medicare.People laid off from payroll jobs through no fault of their own are typically eligible for unemployment benefits. which are provided by state workforce agencies at levels determined by state lawmakers. Thanks partly to years of cutbacks at the state level. fewer workers are covered. The percentage of workers receiving benefits has fallen to 26% this year from highs of around 40% in the 1950s. according to a new report by The Century Foundation. a progressive think tank. The average weekly benefit is $386. Two dozen states pay benefits amounting to less than the federal poverty level for a two-person household.  At a time of growing economic uncertainty. one thing is clear: the nation s system of unemployment benefits is inadequate and inequitable even during good times. let alone being wholly unprepared for another downturn.  TCF s Andrew Stettner said in a statement. A recession is not a certainty. though the Federal Reserve has said it expects its actions to push unemployment above 4% next year. The national rate stood at a historically low of 3.5% as of September.It s possible that unemployment could rise next year while inflation remains elevated. Since Republicans have blamed price instability on economic relief spending approved by Democrats last year. including extra unemployment benefits. it s not hard to imagine them opposing new relief spending on benefits next year. In a scenario with high inflation and high unemployment. plenty of economists would tell lawmakers that more federal spending would make things worse. After all. the Federal Reserve s entire strategy for fighting inflation hinges on making people poorer.  From the macroeconomic perspective. the best thing might be to sort of weather it out.  Marc Goldwein. senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. said in an interview. Republicans supported a massive expansion of the federal government s role in the unemployment insurance system in 2020 as part of the economic response to the coronavirus pandemic. They had a political incentive to do so. since they wanted to keep a Republican in the White House and economic misfortune often gets blamed on the incumbent president.Congress provided not only extra weeks of benefits. it also boosted weekly payments by $600 and expanded eligibility rules to include categories of workers. such as the self-employed. who are typically shut out. The expanded benefits were essentially a prototype of how Democrats would permanently reform the system. But the pandemic unemployment programs and the crush of claims overwhelmed state workforce agencies. whose vulnerabilities were exploited by fraudsters. including international criminal organizations. House Republicans harped on the billions in fraudulent payments during a September hearing about the administration of the unemployment system ― a likely preview of future attacks on proposals to expand benefits.  The mistakes made during the pandemic should not be repeated. and taxpayers should never again be cheated out of billions of dollars.  Rep. Rick Allen (R-Ga.) said. ,Politics News

Republicansa measureelectionsOhioU.S. SenateRepublican Secretary of State Frank LaRose. the state s elections chief. is championing State Issue 2. a proposal advanced by Ohio s GOP-led state Legislature. It would make a tiny but pivotal wording change to the Ohio Constitution. from guaranteeing voting rights for  every citizen  of the U.S. who meets certain criteria to  only citizens  of the U.S. who do.noncitizen voting in federal and state elections It s a bad idea to callously give away the right to vote to people that haven t earned it.  LaRose said at an October news conference touting the issue.  I think that citizenship has value. citizenship has status. So many of our ancestors worked so hard to earn that citizenship. As of 2020. six states — Alabama. Arizona. Colorado. Florida. Minnesota and North Dakota — adopted the  only citizens  alternative in their state constitutions. according to the group Americans for Citizen Voting.Legal immigrants fighting for the right to vote in local elections invoke a similarly patriotic rallying cry. this one from the American Revolution. They say they pay taxes. yet can t vote on offices such as mayor or city council or on levies for their kids  schools.passed in Januaryput on hold by a judge So if my monies are going to be going into a system to fund and make changes in my immediate community. or wherever I teach or I work or I socialize. then I — and other individuals like myself — should be able to put our voice behind individuals that align with your philosophy.  she said.In Ohio. only one small town in modern times — liberal. 3.700-resident Yellow Springs — has approved a charter amendment allowing noncitizen voting on local candidates and issues. The amendment passed by referendum in 2019. but it was stopped by LaRose. who asserted that the program violated both the state and federal constitutions.Village leaders disagreed. said City Council President Brian Housh. but they didn t have the resources to mount a legal challenge. They would have argued that expanding voting to noncitizens falls within Yellow Springs  rights to home rule and local control. he said.LaRose said at the news conference that. besides defying one of the key privileges of citizenship. allowing noncitizens to vote would create  a huge administrative lift and burden  for local boards of elections. That s something Housh also disagrees with. He said the Greene County Board of Elections told the village it was  quite confident  it could handle offering and counting ballots for the estimated 30 noncitizens who could have been added to the rolls.Housh views the anti-immigrant rhetoric around the ballot issue as a scare tactic to drive GOP voters to the polls and generate campaign contributions. We ve been accused by Secretary LaRose of disrupting the election process and being un-American.  Housh said.  I get it. Most communities in Ohio would probably not enfranchise non-U.S. citizen residents to vote. But that fits our community. Our citizens value that diversity and think people who contribute to the community should be represented. Yellow Springs took its cue from Maryland. which has 11 of the 15 municipalities in the U.S. that have approved noncitizen voting. New York. San Francisco and two towns in Vermont round out the list.Barney Rush. the mayor of Chevy Chase. Maryland. said his suburban Washington. D.C.. community has a number of residents who are foreign-born and working at embassies or for international organizations — and they wanted a say in local life. These are longstanding town residents. they have a very keen interest in town affairs. many of them owned property and so they had a vested interest in how the town conducted itself.  he said.  For us. it was really just a matter of recognizing people living in the town. He estimated roughly 20 noncitizens were added to the rolls in a community of about 1.000 homes. and said the program has been without incident since it was passed in 2018.RepublicansSan Francisco allows noncitizen parents and guardians of schoolchildren to vote in school board races. About 13.600 students come from families whose second language is English — one possible indicator of how many thousands of people might be eligible. The city doesn t know for sure. said elections director John Arntz. but so far only 63 noncitizens have registered.In New York. more than 800.000 noncitizens and  Dreamers  — those brought to the U.S. as children — would be empowered to vote under its new law. A similar proposal is on the November ballot in Oakland. a city of about 420.000 across the bay from San Francisco. The city council in the District of Columbia. a city of more than 700.000. voted just this month to allow noncitizen voting.State Rep. Bill Seitz. one of the Republican co-sponsors of the Ohio legislation that advanced the noncitizen prohibition onto the ballot. said it is particularly important for Ohio to act because its cities have the ability to tax people who work. but do not live. there. So if these cities pick up the liberal progressive mantra of allowing noncitizens to vote. they will be able to vote not only in their local elections but on increasing the taxes payable by the nonresident workers who commute into the city to work.  he said.  That s why all of us — township residents. folks in the unincorporated area. folks in the rural area — better wake up. Among U.S. citizens who back the Ohio amendment is Luis Gil. a Republican running for county commissioner in central Ohio. Gil moved to the U.S. from Venezuela when he was 18 and said he never believed in shortcuts to the privileges of citizenship.

After the Taliban detained and tortured Safi Rauf. a Naval reservist and former linguist with U.S. Special Forces. he realized how dangerous it was for Afghans with ties to the U.S. to live under Taliban rule. Over the past month. Rauf and other U.S. veterans have been traveling to conservative states to lobby for a bipartisan bill that would make it easier for Afghan evacuees to become legal permanent residents and will help those who are left behind to come to the U.S.  Nobody understands better than me.  Rauf said. remembering what it was like to be held hostage by the Taliban.  I saw Afghans in prison. I saw people from the military. anybody who had worked with Americans and how they were being tortured.  He and his brother were helping at-risk Afghans evacuate the country last December when they were both captured. The U.S. government negotiated their release after 105 days of detention and torture. Rauf came to America in 2010 as an Afghan refugee when he was 17. served with the U.S. Special Forces and worked closely with the Afghans on the ground from 2012 to 2016. He is currently in the U.S. Navy Reserves.Rauf said the Afghan Adjustment Act gives Americans the opportunity to support Afghans who helped U.S. war efforts and ensure that they arrive safely in the states. Veterans. when we left all of those allies behind. suffered moral injury.  Rauf said.  Our military told them that if they support our military. we will get back to help them. and they will have a good life here in America. under democracy.   And the Afghans who are [already evacuated] here. they are very committed to the American way.  he continued.  They are going to be productive and contributing members of society who join the military. become engineers. doctors. scientists. creators.  As a quick fix after the surprise fall of Kabul last year and the ensuing chaos. the United States granted 77.000 Afghans who were able to leave the country temporary status known as Humanitarian Parole. which allowed them to stay in the country for up to two years without establishing a clear legal pathway to permanent residence and eventually. citizenship. Tens of thousands of eligible people who were not lucky enough to fly out of Afghanistan are now waiting for the processing of their Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) ― a program that allows Afghans who worked on behalf of the U.S. government in Afghanistan to resettle in the U.S.But the program is moving slowly. Since the start of the Biden administration through Sept. 30. 2022. the State Department has issued more than 18.000 SIVs to principal applicants and their eligible family members. a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost. The number is far lower to cater to the backlog that has plagued the program.As of May 2022. there were 61.888 principal applications in process and an estimated 259.930 additional eligible family members of those principal applicants. for a total of about 322.000 estimated Afghan SIV applicants. the State Department s Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported. The bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act was introduced in August and its passage can help Afghans in the U.S. to adjust their status and get green cards. and it would also speed up the process and increase eligibility for special immigrant visas for those remaining in Afghanistan.But some Republicansare against the bill. blaming the Biden administration for a disorganized airlift operation and arguing that Afghan evacuees were not sufficiently vetted. A Defense Department report from February only records on 50 Afghan evacuees indicated  potentially significant security concerns. However. the bill includes precise language on new vetting procedures that would need to be met for every applicant. even though Afghans who were evacuated had already been vetted at U.S. bases in the Middle East and Europe before entering the U.S.In September. Rauf was among the advocates and veteran groups pushing for the passage of the bill through a fire watch outside of Capitol Hill. However. the effort to attach the Afghan Adjustment Act to a stopgap spending bill before Congress left for recess in October was unsuccessful. If the bill is included in the omnibus bill that will be voted on in December. it has a chance of becoming a law this year.Taking this opportunity. Rauf and his fellow veterans have been making the rounds in red states. where they hope to win over Republican senators and garner more support from the veteran communities and the public. The group has already stopped at Ohio. Indiana. Iowa. Nebraska. Kansas. Colorado. Wyoming. Montana. Idaho and Utah throughout October. and plans to keep driving south and eastward. We have spoken to some of the most conservative Republicans. and they all seem to be supporting us.  Rauf said.  This is very common-sense legislation. The problem is that there wasn t enough advocacy being done about the information of what this act is about. The bill overall however. has not been fully supported by all Republicans since it was introduced. partly because of their anti-immigration stance. But this is not immigration.  Rauf said.  These people were brought here by the U.S. military and non-U.S. military planes to the U.S. This is about our allies whose lives are at stake. and they will literally get killed if they were to be sent back to Afghanistan. While violence in Afghanistan has decreased since the U.S. completed its withdrawal last summer. reports indicate that the ruling Taliban are still targeting former members of the military and government officials despite a declared amnesty. Women are subject to new stringent rules. and the government has been accused of targeting minorities and imprisoning and torturing journalists. Additionally. the country s economy is in shambles due in large part to the United States  decision to freeze its citizens  assets. in addition to other factors. such as drought.,Politics News

The criminal trial for the Trump Organization began Monday in New York. as the former president s family business faces accusations that it defrauded the city. state and federal tax authorities for 15 years by providing off-the-books financial perks to its executives.Opening arguments started in the high-profile case. with acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan presiding over the trial. Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney s office told jurors that two of Donald Trump s companies — the Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. — participated in a scheme to illegally compensate executives with lavish perks as a way to help them evade payroll taxes. This case is about greed and cheating — cheating on taxes.  said Susan Hoffinger. the head of the district attorney s investigations division.Although it is his company that s currently on trial. Trump himself is not charged with any wrongdoing — though prosecutors have not yet decided whether he could face criminal charges in the future. Trump was not present in the courtroom. nor were his three oldest children who have all held key positions at the company.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg began investigating Trump and his company s financial practices over three years ago. after going to the U.S. Supreme Court twice to gain access to his tax records. The Trump Organization is the holding company for the former president s real estate buildings. golf courses and other assets. Last year. the company and its former chief financial officer. Allen Weisselberg. were indicted in what prosecutors called a  sweeping and audacious  tax fraud scheme. in which Weisselberg was said to have collected over $1.7 million in untaxed income through off-the-books perks.Weisselberg. 75. pleaded guilty to 15 felony charges in August and pinned the blame for the scheme on himself and other top executives. such as senior vice president and comptroller Jeffrey McConney. who is expected to testify Monday. As part of his plea deal that requires him to serve up to five months in Rikers Island jail. Weisselberg agreed to testify against the company. making him the prosecutors  star witness in the trial.The former CFO. who has been at the company for nearly five decades. has intimate knowledge of the Trump Organization s financial matters. But Weisselberg refused to testify against Trump himself. and so is unlikely to implicate the former president or any of the Trump family members when he takes the stand next week. The witness was warned that he could face 15 years in prison should he be untruthful in his testimony.In opening arguments. Hoffinger brought up Weisselberg s perks that he personally received while serving as the company s CFO. pointing out that the extra income was  tax free.  She said evidence will show that Weisselberg evaded more than $900.000 in taxes because of those perks. some of which included rent for an apartment in the Upper West Side. payments for Mercedes-Benz leases. and school tuition for his grandchildren. We all know that corporations aren t people — they can t think or act on their own.  Hoffinger said before explaining that companies act through their employees. particularly the executives with the authority to direct the company s overall conduct. The law requires that prosecutors prove Weisselberg s actions were taken  in behalf of  the company.The prosecutor reportedly mentioned Trump s name almost a dozen times in her opening statement. tying the former president to the scheme by arguing that he personally paid for Weisselberg s grandchildren s tuition. She also said that Trump s companies  finally had to clean up  their fraudulent tax practices when its owner was elected president in 2016.For the Trump company to beat these charges. it will likely have to prove that Weisselberg is lying in his testimony. Defense attorney Susan Necheles argued to jurors that Weisselberg s actions were his personal choices and not taken on behalf of the company. Noting that she will from now on refer to Trump as  President Trump.  Necheles said the former president was unaware his CFO was cheating on his taxes. This case is about Mr. Weisselberg s and those other employees  personal tax returns.  Necheles told jurors. later adding that they  must not consider this case to be a referendum on President Trump or his policies. The jury also heard from Michael van der Veen. who is representing the Trump Payroll Corp. and served on the second Trump impeachment defense team. Van der Veen attempted to explain the law by saying prosecutors must prove Weisselberg s actions were taken on behalf of the company. but Justice Merchan repeatedly told him it is the judge s job to explain the law. Greed made him cheat on his taxes.  van der Veen said.  Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg. ,Politics News

Supreme Courtaffirmative actionIn Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina. white and Asian students claim that the use of race in admissions that helps the enrollment of Black. Hispanic and Native American students unconstitutionally discriminates against whites and Asians by violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in both cases and the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause granting equal treatment to all persons under the law in the North Carolina case.The lawyers for Students for Fair Admissions. a nonprofit group run by conservative lawyer Ed Blum. who is white and has brought numerous cases before the Supreme Court challenging race-conscious policy-making. argued that any use of race was unconstitutional. They asked the court to overrule its prior precedents authorizing the limited use of race to achieve diversity in the 1978 case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and the approval of the limited affirmative action program used by the University of Michigan in Grutter v. Bollinger. Grutter is grievously wrong.  Patrick Strawbridge. counsel for Students for Fair Admissions. said in arguing that any consideration of race in admissions is unconstitutional and  divisive. The court s six-justice conservative supermajority has the votes to overturn Grutter. Justices John Roberts. Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have all previously ruled in favor of ending race-conscious affirmative action programs. While Justices Neil Gorsuch. Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have a limited record on the issue. they all aligned with the arguments made by the plaintiffs on Monday.Indeed. in their questioning of the lawyers in support of the University of North Carolina. the conservative justices set up a lose-lose situation.First. they pressed Ryan Park. North Carolina s solicitor general. and U.S. solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar to explain how the university measures diversity to know when it has reached a point where it no longer needs to have any kind of race-conscious admissions policy. Gorsuch asked Park how the university can know it is reaching its goal of diversity  without taking account of numbers. Alito repeatedly pressed Park on whether the university would believe it met its goal if the percentage of underrepresented racial minorities. like Blacks. Hispanics and Native Americans. met the percentage of those groups in the broader state population. How do you know you re done?  Barrett asked.Since the court banned the use of racial quotas in Bakke. any admission there that the diversity goal was based on a numerical judgment turned it into an impermissible racial quota and. therefore. a violation of precedent.When they refused to state that they have a numerical quota to judge success. the conservative justices then argued that they were stating that there is no endpoint. This would be problematic because both Bakke and Grutter suggested that affirmative action programs must be time-limited. Grutter suggested a 25-year time limit. which would end in 2028. I don t see how you say the program can ever end.  Alito said.The lack of an endpoint was part of the reason why  racial classifications are dangerous.  Kavanaugh argued.With no end in sight. the conservatives would be right to overturn precedent.The three liberal justices pointed out the limited nature of the race-conscious admissions policy used by the University of North Carolina. as the university does not require any applicant to state their race and only uses race as one of many considerations in admissions.The existence of the checkbox allowing applicants to voluntarily note their race was only one factor among many that admissions officers can take into account. There were only 1.2% of admissions where race played a role. according to expert analysis provided by the University of North Carolina.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also made the case that ending these policies will result in the same claims of discrimination brought by the plaintiffs.Strawbridge argued that admissions officers could consider essays about an applicant s family background. but not race. Jackson posed a hypothetical about two applicants. one explaining their family history of attending the university for five generations and the other detailing their descendants being enslaved people who were denied access to the university.Jackson wanted to know: Would this be an impermissible consideration of race if the admissions office used the second applicant s argument in deciding on admitting them? And if not. wouldn t this mean that Black applicants would be disinclined to note their race. family history or life experience when applying to schools?No admission could  hinge on  the use of race. including an essay explaining family history. Strawbridge said.If that were the case. Jackson followed up. wouldn t that mean Black applicants would be disinclined to mention their race or any family history or life experience that could reveal their race and. therefore. face the same problem of discrimination that the plaintiffs argue that whites and Asians face now?Previous studies of states that banned the consideration of race in admissions found that the implementation of race-neutral policies led to a reduction of Black and Hispanic enrollment in the most highly selective colleges and universities.The two cases before the court were originally meant to be heard together. but were split into two separate arguments because Jackson previously served on the Harvard Board of Overseers and recused from the Harvard case.,Politics News

Trump wants the court to order at least a temporary hold on the Treasury Department turning over his returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee.Trump said the handover could happen as soon as Thursday. without the court s intervention.Lower courts ruled that the committee has broad authority to obtain tax returns and rejected Trump s claims that it was overstepping.Trump had most recently sought the justices  intervention in a legal dispute stemming from the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in August.

Ryan Zinke. the former Montana congressman and Trump-era interior secretary. says he  hates  Washington. D.C.. and the so-called  swamp  of bureaucratic insiders. Democrat Monica Tranel wants to do him a favor and keep him from returning to Congress and the nation s capital next year. Tranel. an environmental lawyer and two-time Olympic rower. has run a scrappy campaign for Montana s new U.S. House seat. slamming her Republican opponent as the face of Trump-era corruption and running numerous advertisements comparing him to a snake. Above all. Tranel. who once  is pitching herself as someone who would go to bat for residents of the Treasure State instead of the sort of special interests that she says Zinke has  sold out  to.  I ve asked voters to vote for me the way people voted in Montana when I was growing up. We vote for people. not parties.  she told HuffPost.  I will serve Montana because this is my home and this is who I am. It s what I ve spent my life doing. It s what I know. The race pits an environmental attorney who has battled the state s largest utility on behalf of renewable energy firms and climate advocates against Montana s former at-large U.S. representative and the muscle of the Trump administration s fossil fuel-centric  energy dominance  agenda. The new House district covers the western part of the state and was created last year to account for population growth in Big Sky Country. It is the first time Montana has had two House seats since 1993.Early on. Zinke was widely expected to be a shoo-in for the seat. given his credentials in a state that President Donald Trump carried by 16 points in 2020. But he floundered in the June primary. barely edging out a win over Al Olszewski. a former state senator and hard-line conservative who attacked Zinke as a self-serving liberal who  quit  Trump. Limited polling indicates that Tranel has gained ground down the stretch. One poll of some 800 likely voters early this month. commissioned by a Democratic political action committee. identified the race as a virtual toss-up. with Zinke at 41% and Tranel at 40% support. The third candidate. Libertarian John Lamb. is also polling high for a third-party candidate and threatens to peel conservative votes away from Zinke. Politico reported earlier this month that  Zinke asked Lamb to drop out of the race and endorse him. More recently. Zinke has accused Tranel and Lamb of working together to defeat him. The increasingly competitive landscape has caused several of the nation s top political analysts. including the Cook Political Report and Larry Sabato. to shift their forecasts for the race from  likely Republican  to  leans Republican. Tranel rejects the idea that this district was ever out of reach for Democrats. pointing to the fact that Sen. Jon Tester (D) won it by 10 points in 2018 and Sen. Steve Daines (R) carried it by only 1 point in 2020.  The polling that we ve had has shown it s even. and honestly. I m surprised that it s even.  Tranel said.  I don t think Ryan Zinke should have a chance in this race. I can t believe anybody would vote for him after the ways that he has betrayed us and sold himself to whatever industry will pay him some money. It s not what Montana needs. Zinke s campaign did not respond to HuffPost s request for comment.As in other midterm races across the country. energy and the economy have been hot-button issues. Zinke. who made a small fortune consulting for ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas interests after resigning from his Interior Department post in early 2019. is campaigning on a promise to restore so-called  American energy independence  and bring back $2 per gallon gasoline — a seemingly impossible task for a lone member of the House. Meanwhile. Tranel is appealing to voters as someone well-positioned to help lead Montana and the nation in its transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels. I have done renewable energy projects from soup to nuts.  she said.  I ve represented the landowner. I ve represented the project developer. I ve represented the project operator and owner. The consumer. I ve written the contracts. I ve written the power purchase agreements. I understand how they work. I understand where their money is. I understand how these things are deployed on the ground. Tranel said the Inflation Reduction Act. the landmark package that Congress passed in August and that includes a historic $369 billion in climate and clean energy investments. presents an enormous opportunity for Big Sky Country. The money and the energy transition lies in the future. it lies in renewable resources.  she said.  And smart people are sinking their money in their investments in our future.  We have incredible resources.  she said of Montana.  We have winter-peaking wind. We have solar. We have hydro. I think it s a question of having a person be a bridge between the resources that are available and resources that are on the ground and connecting those up. I can be that person for Montana in a very unique way. Tranel points to her 25-year legal career in Montana. which included working as a staff attorney for Montana s Public Service Commission. a state agency that regulates utility companies. and later at the Montana Consumer Counsel. which represents consumer interests in utility matters before the PSC. Tranel twice ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the PSC. first as a Republican in 2004 and as a Democrat in 2020. Since launching her own private practice in 2016. Tranel has represented renewable energy clients and climate advocates in matters before both the PSC and Montana courts. In one of her higher-profile cases. she represented climate group 350 Montana in successfully challenging a 2003 state law that exclusively gave NorthWestern Energy. the largest power company in the state. the ability to seek pre-approval from the PSC to up its rates to cover costs associated with future projects and acquisitions. A judge struck the law down as unconstitutional earlier this year. ruling that it granted  an exclusive and lucrative financial benefit only on NorthWestern.  Tranel says that legal challenge saved Montana ratepayers $10 million. Zinke. meanwhile. has sought to pin the blame for high energy costs on Democratic policies and. more specifically. Tranel s lawsuit against Northwestern. A recent Washington Post analysis showed public support for President Joe Biden and Democratic House candidates moving in tandem with gas prices. As gas prices went up. approval dropped. and vice-versa.Asked if Democrats have a messaging problem when it comes to the issue of high gas and energy prices. which are driven by a complex set of factors. Tranel took a swing at her opponent.  I reject the idea that Ryan Zinke knows anything about energy. He doesn t.  she said.  He has taken a lot of money from fossil fuel corporations. That doesn t mean he knows anything about energy. Tranel pointed out that Zinke backed Republican-led legislation in 2015 that lifted the 40-year ban on crude oil exports — a move that has led to a surge in U.S. oil and natural gas exports but contributed to higherprices for domestic consumers. The fact that our gas prices are high is a function of the Republican decision to open up our market and compete internationally.  she said.  What I say is. ‘Every time you put gas in your [car]. think how much of that is going into Ryan Zinke s pocket.  That s what we re paying for. We re paying for political pawns like him to do the bidding of the fossil fuel corporations. Zinke s scandal-plagued record at the Interior Department has also been front and center in the race. The former Navy SEAL faced a dizzying 18 federal probes into his conduct and policy decisions. Zinke has done his best to downplay the probes. simultaneously dismissing them as  political hit jobs  while falsely claiming that he was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. And at a recent debate. he slammed Interior Inspector General Mark Greenblatt — whom Trump nominated to the post — as a  political hack.  although he didn t mention Greenblatt by name.At least four separate investigations into Zinke s actions as interior secretary found varying levels of misconduct. including that he misused his office and lied to investigators.Asked about Zinke s various broadsides against the Interior Department s Office of Inspector General. a spokesperson for the office. Erica Paulson. replied.  Our work demonstrates our long track record of conducting fair. objective. and unbiased oversight. This is a fundamental part of Inspector General independence and is consistent with the governing standards followed by the entire OIG community.  If Zinke loses his reelection bid on Nov. 8. it will be in no small part because those scandals followed him home. Tranel has spent a lot of time and resources making sure they do. drawing attention to Zinke s ethical shortfalls during debates and in TV advertisements and handing out copies of Interior Department watchdog reports into his conduct. This week. she released what is at least her fourth snake-themed ad.  We gave Ryan Zinke a chance. He sold us out to line his own pockets.  she says.  After I deal with Ryan Zinke. I m coming for the rest of the snakes ripping us off.  In announcing that it had changed its rating for Zinke and Tranel s race earlier this month. The Cook Political Report wrote that the contest should have been a  slam dunk  for Republicans. but that Zinke s  ethics-clouded exit from the Trump administration and whereabouts since have complicated his congressional comeback bid.  In its own announcement. Sabato s Crystal Ball wrote that Zinke was  plagued by a number of ethics investigations  and  lost some luster  after becoming a national figure in the Trump administration. Tranel and Zinke are both promising to go to war with serpents if elected as Montana s next House representative. They just have very different views about who it is that makes up that proverbial swamp. To Zinke. the snakes are Biden. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and anyone who would support their agendas. as well as so-called  radical environmentalists  and  deep state  bureaucrats. If re-elected to Congress. Zinke has promised that his first piece of legislation would be what he s dubbed the Federal Employee Accountability & Reduction Act. or FEAR Act. a 10-point legislative framework to gut federal agencies of public servants and limit how long a person can hold a federal job.To Tranel. the snakes are special interests and people like her opponent.  There s nothing fake about showing up and answering questions from the people of Montana.  she said. a dig at Zinke s decision to skip more than a dozen candidate forums ahead of the midterm. including one in his hometown of Whitefish.  He thinks he s entitled to win and that people in Montana are just going to vote for him because he has an R behind his name. I have more respect for the people of Montana than that. If elected. Tranel says she d prioritize legislation to address Montana s housing crisis. conserve public lands. protect abortion access and strengthen rights for union workers. And while she d enter Congress at a time of deep political division and. if forecasts prove accurate. part of a Democratic minority. Tranel has every intention of making her mark. She draws inspiration from Jeannette Rankin. the famous women s rights activist from Montana who in 1917 became the first female member of Congress and championed legislation that eventually became the 19th Amendment. granting women the right to vote nationwide.  I say never underestimate the power of a freshman congresswoman from Montana.  Tranel said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated when the Montana primary was held and when Ryan Zinke resigned from Interior.,Politics News

PREDAPPIO. Italy (AP) — Several thousand black-clad fascist sympathizers chanted and sang in praise of the late Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on Sunday as they marched to his crypt. 100 years after Mussolini entered Rome and completed a bloodless coup that gave rise to two decades of fascist rule.March on RomeOn Oct. 28. 1922. black-shirted fascists entered the Italian capital. launching a putsch that culminated two days later when Italy s king handed Mussolini the mandate to start a new government.The crowd in Predappio. Mussolini s birthplace and final resting place in the northern Emilia-Romagna region. also was apparently emboldened by the fact that a party with neo-fascist roots is heading an Italian government for the first time since World War II.Organizers warned participants. who arrived from as far away as Rome. Belgium and the United States. not to flash the Roman salute used by the Fascists. or they would risk prosecution. Still. some couldn t resist as the crowd stopped outside the cemetery where Mussolini is laid to rest to listen to prayers and greetings from Mussolini s great-granddaughter. Orsola. After 100 years. we are still here to pay homage to the man this state wanted. and who we will never stop admiring.  Orsola Mussolini said. to cheers.She listed her great-grandfather s accomplishments. citing an infrastructure boom that built schools. hospitals and public buildings. reclaimed malaria-infested swamps for cities. and the extension of a pension system to non-government workers. She was joined by her sister Vittoria. who led the crowd in a prayer.The crowd gave a final shout of  Duce. Duce. Duce!  Mussolini s honorific as Italy s dictator.Anti-fascist campaigners held a march in PredappioInside the cemetery on Sunday. admirers lined up a handful at a time to enter his crypt. tucked away in a back corner. Each was given a memory card signed by his great-grandaughters with a photo of a smiling Mussolini holding his gloved hand high in a Roman salute.  History will prove me right.  the card reads.Italy s failure to fully come to terms with its fascist past has never been more stark than now. as Italy s new Premier Giorgia Meloni seeks to distance her far-right Brothers of Italy party from its neo-fascist roots.This week. she decried fascism s anti-democratic nature and called its racial laws. which sent thousands of Italian Jews to Nazi death camps.  a low point.  Historians would also add Mussolini s alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II and his disastrous colonial campaign in Africa to fascism s devastating legacies.Now in power. Meloni is seeking a moderate course for a new center-right government that includes Matteo Salvini s League party and Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia. But her victory gives far-right activists a sense of vindication. I would have voted for Lucifer if he could beat the left.  said organizer Mirko Santarelli. who heads the Ravenna chapter of the Arditi. an organization that began as a World War I veterans group and has evolved to include caretaking Mussolini s memory.  I am happy there is a Meloni government. because there is nothing worse than the Italian left. It is not the government that reflects my ideas. but it is better than nothing. He said he would like to see the new Italian government do away with laws that prosecute incitement to hatred and violence motivated by race. ethnicity. religion and nationality. It includes use of emblems and symbols — many of which were present in Sunday s march.Santarelli said the law punishes  the crime of opinion.  It is used as castor oil by the left to make us keep quiet. When I am asked my opinion of Mussolini. and it is clear I speak well of him. I risk being denounced.  Santarelli said.Lawyer Francesco Minutillo. a far-right activist who represents the organizers. said Italy s high court established that manifestations are permissible as long as they are commemorative  and don t meet the criteria that risks the reconstitution of the fascist party. Still. he said. magistrates in recent years have opened investigations into similar manifestations in Predappio and elsewhere to make sure they don t violate the law. One such case was closed without charges last week.To avoid having their message misrepresented. Santarelli asked the rank and file present not to speak to journalists. Most complied.A young American man wearing a T-shirt with a hand-drawn swastika inside a heart and the words  Brand New Dream.  and a fascist fez said he had timed his European vacation to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the March on Rome so he could participate in the march in Predappio. He declined to identify himself. other than to say he was from New Jersey. and lamented there was no fascist group back home to join.Rachele Massimi traveled with a group four hours from Rome on Sunday to participate in the event. bringing her 3-year-old who watched from a stroller. It s historic.  Massimi said.  It s a memory. ,Politics News

A woman yelled out that Barack Obama was  fine  after the former president made references to himself growing older while speaking at a rally for Democratic voters in Detroit on Saturday.  I have to admit that sometimes going out on the campaign trail feels a little harder than it used to.  the 44th president said to the crowd at Renaissance High School.  Not just because I m older and grayer… A woman directly behind Obama responded to the 61-year-old s self-critique by screaming that he was  finer than a mug.  suggesting he was still in pristine form in her eyes.  Mug  is a euphemism for  motherfucker  within the Black community.While the audience laughed at the woman s compliment. Obama asked if she could repeat herself. She said I was still fine.  Obama said into the mic with a smile.  I m not gonna tell Michelle you said that. although Michelle does agree. She knows.  he said. referring to the former first lady.A video of the interaction between Obama and the woman has garnered more than 5 million views on Twitter.Obama was in Michigan to support Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer s reelection on Nov. 8 against her Republican opponent. Tudor Dixon. At the rally. Obama talked about key factors affecting the psyche of voters. including abortion and inflation. while attempting to galvanize them to participate at the polls.While speaking about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s (D-Calif.) husband.

Twitter s new owner. Elon Musk. pushed a false conspiracy theory on Sunday about the life-threatening assault of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s husband days earlier. further amplifying the type of disinformation that can lead to political violence. Musk soon deleted his tweet without explanation or apology.On Friday. a man broke into the Pelosis  San Francisco home and beat 82-year-old Paul Pelosi with a hammer. resulting in a skull fracture and other severe injuries that required surgery. The attacker reportedly confronted Paul Pelosi asking.  Where is Nancy. where is Nancy?  before assaulting the politician s husband.San Francisco police. who arrived on the scene during the encounter. identified the suspect as 42-year-old David DePape. He was arrested on charges of attempted homicide. assault with a deadly weapon. elder abuse and burglary. Police told NBC News that Paul Pelosi and DePape were the only people in the home. clarifying earlier statements authorities made on Friday that indicated there was a third person in the home who opened the door. Online posts that appear to be from DePape show evidence of right-wing radicalization. sharing conspiracy theories related to voter fraud and QAnon. as well as content about pedophilia. Jews. Black people. transgender people and Democrats.The attack on Paul Pelosi resulted in an outcry from mostly Democratic officials. including President Joe Biden. about the normalization of dangerous. threatening rhetoric among the right that is more frequently evolving into political violence. The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking. but not surprising. that violence is the result.  former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted on Saturday. linking to a Los Angeles Times article about DePape s apparent far-right associations.  As citizens. we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow. Musk initially responded to Clinton s tweet:  There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.  attaching a link to an article falsely claiming that Paul Pelosi s attacker was a lover he met at a bar in the middle of the night. The claim is not credible by any means and further threatens the safety of not only Pelosi and her family but also those in the LGBTQ community. Police confirmed to NBC News that Paul Pelosi and the suspected attacker did not know each other prior to the attack. debunking the conspiracy elevated by Musk.Musk s tweet was deleted hours later.The article in question was in the Santa Monica Observer. a right-wing outlet known for publishing disinformation and outlandish conspiracy theories. The website once went as far as to peddle an outrageous conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton had died and that the Democratic nominee running for president against Donald Trump in 2016 was actually a robot.Musk s amplification of the far-right conspiracy about the Pelosis comes just two days after he took the helm as Twitter s chief. a move that has worried users and officials about the future of the platform and its anticipated elevation of disinformation. The billionaire s tweet on Sunday was further evidence of that concern.On NBC s  Meet the Press.  Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told host Chuck Todd that she does not trust Musk to run Twitter ethically. Klobuchar. who chairs the Senate committee overseeing federal elections. said she endorses reducing social media companies  Section 230 immunity. which would allow them to be sued for making money off of amplifying election disinformation and hate speech. I think you have to have some content moderation. because when you look at what this guy was looking at. he was looking at just horrendous things you don t even want to talk about on your show. He was posting antisemitic tropes. He was showing memes that showed violence and all of this election-denying. pro-Trump MAGA crowd rhetoric.  the senator said of the reported online footprint of Paul Pelosi s attacker. That s what we re dealing with here. And if Elon Musk has said now that he s going to start a content moderation board. that was one good sign. But I continue to be concerned about that.  she continued.  I just don t think people should be making money off of passing on this stuff that s a bunch of lies. You couldn t do that on your own network. Chuck. … You guys look at commercials and you decide if they are false or not. That is not a requirement of these companies and we have to change the requirements on these companies. They are making money off of us. They are making money off of this violence.

Two-and-a-half hours after polls closed in every state in the 2020 election. then-President Donald Trump declared victory and said he was going to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to stop states from counting any more legally cast ballots. We want all voting to stop. We don t want them to find any ballots at four in the morning and add them to the list.  Trump said before adding.  Frankly. we did win the election. As the hours turned into days before the presidential election was finally called for Democrat Joe Biden. Trump built his lie that the election was stolen from him. The late-counted. or  overtime.  ballots (generally mail ballots and provisional ballots) cast in heavily Black and Latino counties favoring Democrats were deemed fraudulent. Election workers had switched real votes for fake ones. whether by USB drive or ballot drop boxes. Trump and his allies claimed. And on and on. The claims referred to the presidential votes only. though. while Republican victories from the same ballots were accepted.Of course Trump was going to contest the results — at the time he was still disputing the outcome of an election he d won. He repeatedly claimed he actually won the popular vote in 2016  if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.  In 2018. he lied that Democrats were involved in a  big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud.  when ballots counted after Election Day favored Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). who ultimately lost. He also falsely declared  electoral corruption  and called for a  new Election  when Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) defeated incumbent Republican Martha McSally after ballots counted after Election Day came in.In each case. Trump s lies revolved around the mechanics of election administration: how voters cast their ballots and how states counted them. The counting of ballots after Election Day turned into evidence of fraud in his imagination. And though none of his claims were true and all were fact-checked by the press and election law experts and readily dismissed from the courts. the Republican Party grasped onto them and won t let go.This presents the possibility of yet another nightmare following Election Day on Nov. 8. Little has changed in how the votes will be cast and how they will be counted in key states across the country. The same scenario that Trump used to lie about the election results in the past three elections will happen again. The only difference is that this year there are hundreds of Republicans who endorse his lies running for offices up and down the ballot.Since Trump left office. Republicans have been seeding the idea that all elections they do not win would have been necessarily corrupted by fraud. I m going to win the election. and I will accept that result.  Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. who claims to not believe Biden won the 2020 election. said Oct. 16 on CNN while pointedly refusing to state whether she would accept the results if she lost. We ve an absolute right to have it proven to us that the election was fair. If it is fair. Kari Lake s going to win.

Minnesota and Nevada all believe that the 2020 election was illegitimate and refuse to accept the 2022 results ― if they lose. of course.Doug Mastriano. the far-right election-denying GOP gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania. led Trump s efforts to overturn the presidential election results in the state and has refused to say whether he would accept the results of his own election.These repeated claims. from GOP politicians and the movement s media superstars. have conditioned the base to believe in widespread voter fraud. a recent poll showed two-thirds of Republican voters do not accept that Biden fairly won the 2020 election. So when there s another delayed count in the upcoming midterms. all hell may break loose once again. 2013 political science paperreport by the MIT Election Data + Science LabNot only was the blue shift comparable to the 2016 election. but most states reported vote totals quickly with only 10 states and the District of Columbia not reporting 90% or more of their final vote 48 hours after the polls closed. In almost every state. the presidential victor was clear within five hours of polls closing.  the report states.  In the few exceptions. the problem was not wild gyrations in reported election results. but the simple fact that the vote count was close. What mattered. ultimately. was that the vote totals were close enough in states like Arizona. Georgia. Michigan. Nevada. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to delay major outlets from calling the results ― and thus the final outcome of the presidential race. And then Trump was eager to lie about election fraud.The Republican Party s current embrace of Trump s lies are paramount here. It plans to claim election fraud even if the party wins. just as Trump did in 2016.Election protection workers point to Arizona. Michigan. Nevada. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the key states where they are concerned about false claims of fraud post-election. These are among the same states that featured closely fought races and took longer to report over 90% of their vote totals — and now feature GOP candidates running who will refuse to accept the results if they lose. This promises to create a chaotic situation after the polls close.In Michigan. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. the high rate of late-counted ballots can be chalked up to both the refusal of Republicans in state legislatures to pass bills allowing mail ballots to be processed prior to Election Day and the fact that votes were counted at centralized locations in the counties. requiring the ballots to be transported.Mailed ballots need to be processed before they are counted. Ballot processing can involve opening the envelopes. removing the ballots from their envelopes and doing a signature match or entering the ballots into a tabulation machine. By allowing already returned ballots to be pre-processed. states can ease the burden placed on election workers on and after Election Day.In the last election. Michigan and Pennsylvania saw their largest counties. which contain the largest share of Democratic voters. take much longer to report their ballots. Eight hours after the polls closed. only 47% of the vote was reported in Wayne County. Michigan. and 53% for Philadelphia County. Pennsylvania. The vote total for Pennsylvania didn t hit 90% of the final vote until more than 24 hours after the polls closed. This could have been caused by the centralization of vote counting at the county level. rather than the municipal. according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab report.election clerks notedThis may relieve some of the crush. but those ballots would still need to be counted on Election Day while any mail ballots returned on Election Day would still need to be processed and then counted.Republicans in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania continued to refuse to allow any time for ballots to be pre-processed after 2020. We were saying. in Pennsylvania you have to pass something to deal with pre-processing.  said Sylvia Albert. director of voting and elections for Common Cause. a nonprofit active in monitoring elections.  To me. at this point. it is purposeful. They want chaos. If you refuse to pass laws. you are asking for what s next. Rolling StoneSo far. Democrats account for 70% of requested mail ballots and 72% of returned mail ballots. The total could account for about one-quarter of the vote total for Democratic candidates if turnout winds up somewhere in between the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election.told reporters on Oct. 11Arizona. where every Republican running statewide claims the 2020 election was riddled with fraud. was among the 10 states that did not report more than 90% of their total vote within 48 hours of the polls closing. Recent statewide elections in the state have been incredibly close. Biden defeated Trump by a little more than 10.000 votes. Kelly won his 2020 race by around 70.000 votes. and Sinema won her 2018 race by less than 60.000.The state has since become a hotbed of election-related conspiracy theories. with the state legislature voting to audit the vote in Maricopa County. which holds 60% of the state s population. after Biden won it in 2020. The partisan audit was highly contentious but ended by showing that there was no widespread fraud in the election. (Biden actually gained votes in the audit s final tally.)Most Arizona voters cast their ballots by mail. and the state does allow election workers to pre-process and count those ballots ahead of Election Day. But a large number of voters return their ballots on Election Day. The  late early votes.  as they re called in the state. make Arizona one of the states with the largest overtime vote count. Arizona also allows voters to correct any errors on their ballot up to five days after the election. If elections are close. it might be a week or more before we have solid results.  said Alex Gulotta. Arizona state director for All Voting Is Local. a nonprofit voting rights and election protection group.  And that s in the normal course. Like Arizona. Nevada did not report more than 90% of its vote until over 48 hours after polls closed. The high overtime vote in the state is likely chalked up to its rules around mail voting. All voters are provided a mail ballot. which can be accepted up to four days after the election if it is postmarked on or before Election Day. Voters are also given up to seven days after the election to cure any errors found on their ballots. Nevada has a tight Senate race between incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) and GOP challenger Adam Laxalt. who has refused to answer multiple questions from local media about whether he will accept the midterm election result but did tell The New York Times and The Washington Post that he would accept the results. While the 2020 overtime vote in Arizona actually provided a  red shift.  in which Trump gained votes in the days after the election. the state saw a blue shift in 2018 that put Sinema in the lead in her race. In Nevada. the overtime vote first tilted to Republicans as rural counties were reported before tilting back toward Democrats as more ballots were counted in Clark County. which includes Las Vegas.The lies Republicans spread about the post-election vote count highlight a mostly overlooked aspect of elections: that they do not end on Election Day. Ballots must be processed. counted. canvassed and certified. When elections are extremely close. recounts may be in order depending on each state s recount laws. In the past. election protection broadly has been about focusing on how we are preparing up to the election ― the day before and the day of the election.  said Quentin Turner. director of Common Cause Michigan.  But in the past couple years. that has changed. The days leading up to and on Election Day are the pregame. The work continues on in just as an intense way after the election. And that is where the most opportunities are for people who want to sow discord or doubt in the process. Just as Trump put pressure on each hinge point in how the Electoral College votes are cast. so too can Republicans who reject the outcome of their elections this year apply pressure in their states.driven out of office by election-denying conspiracistsThese kinds of intimidation campaigns could go into a higher gear after the election. If a race is close. pressure could be applied to officials counting or certifying votes to change the outcome. And just as the outcome on Jan. 6. 2021. hinged on Vice President Mike Pence not following Trump s orders. all of the processes that provide an opportunity for mischief rely on the officials overseeing them to act in good faith.In Michigan. Turner said that the most worrying period is the 14 days after the election. when county totals are canvassed and certified by local boards of canvassers. In 2020. two Republican members of the Wayne County board of canvassers initially attempted to vote against certifying the totals from the largest county in the state after being pressured by Trump and his supporters.said he would not have certified the 2020 election We don t know how the boards of canvassers are going to end up voting.  Turner said.  Hopefully. they all do their jobs like they re supposed to. 10 counties in Nevada. New Mexico and Pennsylvaniatime-consuming and error-prone processcease its hand countElections officials of Cochise County. Arizona. also tried to count their ballots only by hand. but they agreed to abide by a court order telling them to stop on Thursday. It is fairly likely that some election administrator somewhere in the country is probably going to refuse to certify the results in their jurisdiction for some reason.  said Adav Noti. legal director of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. which is engaged in election protection efforts.numerous other state and local racesThis change would extend the amount of time when the final outcome of a close race would be either unclear or open to debate possibly into December. This could potentially give one of the many election-denying Arizona candidates extra time to whip up paranoia about the election results and put increased pressure on election workers. That is a difference from 2020 that is very dangerous.  Gulotta said.Republican National Committee and former Trump adviser Steve BannonPoliticoElection protection groups and legal allies are anticipating a flood of activity on and after Election Day. And with many key races neck-and-neck in the polls. another post-election frenzy of litigation is expected. Republicans may very well be as unsuccessful as they were in the courts and the streets in 2020.But the rot in American elections appears to be setting in. Trump s lies have taken hold of the Republican Party. Every election now features figures who do not believe in the function of democratic elections. unless they win them.And if they do win in 2022. then they will be in a position to ensure Trump has the crucial allies he lacked in 2020 when he called for  all voting to stop. ,Politics News

On Friday. just hours after news broke that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s husband. Paul. was the victim of a violent attack in their home. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was speaking at a Republican campaign rally in his state. The situation was serious. An intruder broke into the Pelosis  house and beat Paul with a hammer. Youngkin took the opportunity to say that he didn t condone any sort of violence ― but he still decided to make the Democratic leader a punchline.  Speaker Pelosi s husband. they had a break-in last night in their house. he was assaulted. There s no room for violence anywhere. but we re going to send her back to be with him in California.  Youngkin said.  That s what we re going to go do. Pelosi actually did return to California on Friday ― to be with her husband. who was undergoing surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands. Youngkin s comment may have been tactless. but it wasn t out of the ordinary for Republicans. who have made Pelosi their leading bogeyman for years. In speech after speech. and in ad after ad. Republicans have demonized Pelosi and at times used violent rhetoric in discussing her. She has long been the target of conservative ire ― and. at times. actual violence. David DePape. the 42-year-old man who has been arrested in the attack. came to the house looking for the speaker and shouting.  Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?  Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the incident. but DePape s internet presence suggests an obsession with far-right conspiracy theories. Nancy Pelosi has some of the thickest skin in politics.  said Faiz Shakir. an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who once worked for Pelosi.  She s taken all kinds of escalating verbal abuse for years and has always understood that if you want to be a leader. there s a certain toughness that has to come with it. It s absolutely horrendous that one of her detractors decided that physical violence was the only recourse to her strength. Pelosi became the first female speaker of the House in January 2007. Her centrality to Republican attacks really picked up in 2010. after Democrats approved the Affordable Care Act.  Fire Nancy Pelosi  became a GOP rallying cry. In the years since then. Republicans have said Pelosi is leading an  assault on your Second Amendment rights  and have accused her of  tyranny.  Tying a frontline Democrat to Pelosi ― a wealthy liberal woman from San Francisco ― is a no-brainer for Republicans in most congressional races. She has become easy shorthand for Republicans to depict the Democratic Party as out of touch with regular Americans. They depict her. quite frankly. as a villain – or. as Donald Trump has called her. a  nasty. vindictive. horrible person.  From 2006 to January 6. she s been the target of every kind of right-wing conspiracy and hate. You can t feed people poison for years and then be surprised when what they do is toxic.  said Jesse Ferguson. a former top official at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. There have been many threats to her life. There was the North Carolina man who threatened to shoot Pelosi and came to D.C. with multiple guns and. according to the FBI. roughly 2.500 rounds of ammunition in 2021. That same year. an Arizona man called her Washington office and threatened to kill her. A Minnesota man also called her California office and threatened to inflict  pain in every way.  Then there was the Florida man who threatened to behead her in 2019. On Jan. 6. 2021. as a violent mob of Trump supporters overtook the U.S. Capitol. police evacuated Pelosi because her life was at risk. Federal officials arrested a man who broke into her office. rifled through papers and took pictures of himself with his feet on a desk.Nevertheless. Republicans have repeatedly sought to blame her for the attack on the Capitol. centered on inaccurate claims that she was personally responsible for the failure in security on Jan. 6.And conservative media like Fox News regularly features segments and images like this: Republicans continue to feature Pelosi in attack ads this election cycle. In fact. as I m sitting here writing this piece. a campaign commercial popped up during the World Series game tying Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) to the liberal speaker. The rhetoric is not always violent. but sometimes it is.  I want you to watch Nancy Pelosi hand me that gavel. It will be hard not to hit her with it.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters in August. discussing the GOP winning back the House in the November elections. His spokesperson said he was  obviously joking.  Pelosi has long been concerned about the effects of violent political rhetoric. In 2009. HuffPost s Jonathan Nicholson. then a reporter with Bloomberg Government. asked Pelosi about whether she was worried about violence from the burgeoning tea party movement. She invoked the assassination of city Supervisor Harvey Milk in San Francisco in 1978.  I have concerns about some of the language that is being used because I saw this myself in the late  70s in San Francisco. this kind of rhetoric. ... It created a climate in which violence took place.  she said. adding.  I wish we would all curb our enthusiasm in some of the statements and understand that some of the ears that it is falling on are not as balanced as the person making the statements may assume. ,Politics News
Abdelnasser Rashid was one of the dozens of American Muslims who ran for office in 2018.It was dubbed the Muslim blue wave. where more than 90 American Muslims ran for office up and down the ballot. emboldened to push back against then-President Donald Trump s hateful rhetoric and policies toward their community.Rashid. a 33-year-old Harvard graduate. ran for his local county commissioner office but lost by 1% to the incumbent.He didn t give up. In 2020. Rashid ran for a position on Illinois  Cook County Board of Review. a property tax administration role. He didn t land that one either.Now. Rashid is taking everything he has learned and making his third run ― this time for state representative.During the 2018 midterms. American Muslims jumped into politics in record numbers. The candidates were mostly young. mostly inexperienced: long shots. in other words. Many of them didn t run again after their losses. or left politics entirely.But then there were candidates like Rashid. who hasn t stopped fighting for his chance to formally serve in public office. Four years later. a number of American Muslim candidates are still running — now with years of experience under their belts. We re seeing fewer long-shot candidates running and many more serious candidates running.  said Mohammed Missouri. the executive director of Jetpac. a nonprofit that works to increase Muslim representation in U.S. government and politics.This time around. rather than running as a direct response to Trump. Muslim candidates are aiming for long-term gains with more diverse policy platforms.They have developed mature political strategies and are focusing on securing seats in local and state politics. It s about running for positions where policy is being decided on a local level that impacts our community. and having a voice at the table and influencing those policies in a positive way.  Missouri said.A record 181 candidates who identify as Muslim were on 2020 ballots across 28 states and Washington. D.C.. according to a report by Jetpac. the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Mpower Change. a social justice organization. The report. released Wednesday. analyzes the 2020 campaigns of Muslim American candidates. 80 of whom were ultimately elected to office. By contrast. 49 Muslim candidates were elected to public office in 2019. and 57 were elected in 2018.Rashid s work in politics began years before Trump ran for president. in 2008. when he took a semester off from Harvard to work as a field organizer for Barack Obama s general campaign in Michigan. After graduating in 2011. Rashid went on to work for an immigrant rights organization. helping pass immigration reform legislation at the state and federal levels.He later joined Rep. Jesús García s campaign as a field director when García. an Illinois Democrat. ran for mayor of Chicago in 2015. The following year. Rashid was the deputy state director for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders  presidential campaign in Illinois.After working in local politics in Cook County for four years. Rashid launched his county commissioner run in 2018. just barely losing to the incumbent. A heartbreaking loss like that is bittersweet. because on the one hand. you lost when it was just almost within reach.  Rashid said.  At the same time. it was so close that you feel like. ‘I can do this again.  Rashid did run again. for the spot on the Cook County Board of Review. but again was unsuccessful. He was unsure if he would run a third time. But motivated by his wife. his volunteers. and local leaders in the American Muslim community. Rashid set his eyes on the Illinois House of Representatives. aiming to represent District 21 as a Democrat. There may be short-term setbacks. but there are learning opportunities.  he said.  It s really important that we are doing this. because we know what we re able to offer to voters. and we have a vision for how we want to see our government. our state. and our country look like. There are currently 29 Muslim state legislators across 18 states. according to Jetpac. New York and Minnesota. with three Muslim state legislators each. have the most of any state. Among the total group of 29. 26 are Democrats and one is a Republican. Only five of them were elected prior to January 2017. Twenty-four of those legislators are up for reelection next month. and most of them are expected to keep their seats.Atlanta s AOCbacking of Reps. Ilhan OmarBut it wasn t enough. After her loss. Islam quickly endorsed her rival. urging others to do the same. and went on to campaign for her. Working in Southern politics and also being a Southern Democrat. we are very familiar with our several losses over the years.  Islam said.  So while it was disappointing that I lost. it was not something that was unfamiliar to me. Islam. a daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants. wasn t jaded. She says the experience made her more determined to cement her place in politics.  When you re not at the table. you re on the menu.  she said.  I refuse to constantly be at the menu and not have our communities have decision-making power over their own lives. Islam is the Democratic nominee this November for Georgia s state Senate District 7. a new seat creating during the redistricting process. She acknowledged that the work can be draining. but urged her fellow candidates from minority backgrounds not to give up. Being a Muslim woman. being a woman of color. you have to work 10 times harder. That s just the reality of things.  Islam said.  You might lose your first time. but that s part of the journey.  We definitely need more Muslim candidates to run for office up and down the ballot. especially when it comes to local governments. because so many of these issues affect our everyday lives.  she added.  It s also about building a bench. Building that infrastructure is key.  There s an actual pipeline of talented people who either work in public advocacy behind the scenes. or on campaigns. or run for office and succeed because they ve actually built relationships over the last four years and built infrastructure. frankly. for themselves.  Missouri said.Armed with experience and community support. Rashid is ready for another opportunity to serve. He is running in support of gun reform. abortion rights and lower property taxes. After two unsuccessful bids. he hopes this is the race that will give him the opportunity to influence the issues he cares about. Sometimes it means waiting.  he said.  Sometimes it means looking at a different opportunity. ,Politics News

Davids. running for her third term. also cited the idea as her most favored Biden policy.But a day later. the Republican candidate partially backtracked on her support. And Davids accused her of being deceptive about supporting the idea in the first place.That kind of back-and-forth over what s a moderate policy and which candidate is the more moderate one has been central in the race to represent this congressional district on the Kansas side of the Kansas City suburbs. The district s heart in Johnson County is a seemingly endless maze of four-lane arterial roads. tidy homes in shady. tree-lined cul-de-sacs and strip shopping centers with ample free parking.It is a district that Davids  supporters say is growing increasingly purple. reflecting its upper middle-class population and one that wants non-ideological. pragmatic problem-solving. The soft-spoken Davids would appear in some ways a perfect fit. playing up a bipartisan approach to governing. But maybe not this year. The district was redrawn. with one state lawmaker saying outright that the goal was to ensure there would be no Democratic House members from the state. Republicans seem to have regained some of their pre-Dobbs decision political momentum. And Davids is facing a rematch with her 2020 opponent. If Democrats can hold Kansas  Third District. it may mean they can hold other. similar districts across the nation. If they lose it. though. it may mean a long night for them.Molly Ramsay. a 64-year-old retired printing worker who attended Davids  early voting kickoff rally Saturday. told HuffPost Davids has done well for Johnson County. We had a Republican candidate for years and she beat him and it s just been a breath of fresh air. Because I do believe Johnson County is becoming much more of a purple county.  she said. They talked about Kansas being so red? Johnson County is pretty darn purple. Backing up that message was a victory in the August statewide referendum on whether to restrict abortion rights. where the almost 60% vote for the  no  position surprised pundits with both the result and the margin.It was a lesson not lost on Davids  campaign. which hopes to replicate its success in November. And it will need to. given her district s new contours. Redistricting saw her lose a Democrat-heavy portion of Wyandotte County and gain two more rural counties well south of Kansas City. It went from a district where Biden won by almost 11 points in 2020 to one where he would have won by only 4.5 points. according to Daily Kos data.And that was by design. While the redistricting process went through a number of steps before being settled by the state Supreme Court. it started with then-Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle saying lawmakers could draw a map that would ensure an all-Republican House delegation. I guarantee you. we can draw four Republican district maps.  she said.Despite that. the race has been categorized as a toss-up or lean Democratic one for some time. The Cook Political Report moved it from the  toss-up  category to  lean Democratic  on Tuesday. And The New York Times on Thursday said a recent poll showed Davids with a 14-point lead.In some ways. though. Davids would seem to be an unlikely match for the district. even before redistricting brought two rural counties into the mix. She s one of first two Native American women to be elected to the House. a former MMA fighter. and gay. I think people here are glad when folks get to see that Kansas might not be the place that you assume that it is.  she told HuffPost in an interview.  We have a lot more diversity here than people think. We have a lot more open-minded people here than people assume.  Davids said.Adkins said she was running again not because of the redistricting. which was only finalized in the spring. but because of how Biden s term has gone so far. I knew that there would be things that occurred that I didn t agree with. but I could never have imagined that we would be where we are today.  she told HuffPost. citing inflation and the likelihood of a recession.Adkins. too. describes herself as  solution-focused and a business leader  reflecting the pragmatic and common sense leanings of the district.Both candidates are seeking to tie the other to unpopular figures to convince voters they are not the right fit. For Adkins. she brings up Biden and Davids  willingness to vote with him 100%. a figure Davids says is based off of a small sample of recorded votes.For Davids. the political albatross she s trying to hang on Adkins  neck is former Kansas governor and U.S. senator Sam Brownback. who was elected governor while Adkins headed the state GOP and later appointed Adkins to head a state board that reviews children s programs and funding. Adkins notes she was not paid by the state of Kansas and was not part of Brownback s administration. Sam Brownback did so much damage to this state. in terms of decimating our public education funding. There were times when some of our public school systems had to go down to four days a week and our credit rating was downgraded.  Davids said. Her attempt to kind of distance herself from some of those things. it s just very clear.  she said.The Davids campaign was quick to jump on Adkins  comments about Medicare drug negotiations the night of the debate. issuing a  fact check  pointing out Adkins supports the fiscal 2022 budget proposed by the Republican Study Committee. the House GOP s biggest intraparty group.The RSC budget opposed  efforts to index drug prices or to impose any price controls on pharmaceuticals. But Adkins herself was quick to say the day after the debate she did not mean to sound complimentary toward the idea. The federal government. as a payer when it comes to Medicare. can and should negotiate on drug prices to get the best possible drug price.  she said. But Adkins said she worried it would mean less research. a line the drug industry took in opposing the idea. In this country. we are capitalists and we have in health care a free market system and what we don t want to do is discourage innovation when it comes to the future of life-saving drugs.  she said.While the rural counties will likely help Adkins. both candidates held events on the first day of early voting within a mile and half of each other in Johnson County. underscoring its importance. Whose voters show up will go a long way toward determining who will win.Jim Hissong. a 75-year-old semi-retired insurance salesman. held a closed-press  Ask Amanda  event for supporters at his house. Afterwards. he said his big issues are immigration and the economy. I have 16 grandkids and I m getting really concerned about their future with what s happening. I don t know how else to say it.  he said.Stephen Nachtsheim. a 24-year-old college graduate student studying biomedical communications. said he was not really  super invested  in either party but cast his early votes for Davids and other Democrats. I know that socially I ve had friends who have had abortions and that are gay or trans and I think that. while I don t believe that either side is kind of doing everything that I think should be done. I think that the Democrats are more in line with what I want to do in regards to personal freedom and liberty.  he said.,Politics News
Mike KellyThursday night debateDonald Trumpemphasized his anger Should it have happened? Absolutely not.  Kelly said of the attack on the Capitol.  The relentless pursuit of this president. regardless of any information that s gathered. should be shocking to any person that lives in this country.   I understand and fully agree: Jan. 6 should have never happened.  Kelly added.  But when you look at some of the people who are still imprisoned with no way of getting out. you ask yourself: Is this really America? Is this really America? Republicansrejected the idea The vast majority of witnesses in those hearings were either Capitol police or actually Republicans.  replied Pastore. a businessman and attorney.  What does he propose? That we simply brush it under the carpet?  It s important that we get to the bottom of it. and that s what we re trying to do in the Jan. 6 hearings.  Pastore added.another point in the debateFBIKelly is one of the 147 House Republicans that voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results later in the day following the Capitol riot. He had previously sued to invalidate Pennsylvania s 2.5 million ballots on the grounds that the GOP-controlled state legislature s passage of no-excuse absentee voting violated Pennsylvania s constitution. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court. which has a Democratic majority. dismissed the lawsuit in November 2020.Pastore pressed Kelly later on to clarify whether he still believes the 2020 presidential election was  stolen  from Trump.Kelly declined to provide a straight answer. emphasizing instead his continued skepticism of the fairness with which it was administered. My opponent can say anything he wants about. ‘He won t accept.  ‘He won t accept.  ‘He won t accept.   he said.  What I won t accept is the destruction of America and the confidence we need to have in our government and in our elections. Pastore heaped additional condemnation on Kelly in a Friday statement provided to HuffPost. calling Kelly an  embarrassment to Western Pennsylvania.  His comments demonstrate that he is unfit to serve in public office.  Pastore said.  I am running for Congress to uphold the law of the land and to support law enforcement. Mike Kelly stands with violent criminals and attacks the men and women of law enforcement who keep us safe.  Mike Kelly thinks it s unfair that violent criminals who attacked the police and tried to overthrow our government are serving time in prison. and that is outrageous.  he added.  Kelly s attack on federal law enforcement shows that he has no respect for the law and those who protect us. Kelly. a six-term incumbent. is the heavy favorite to win reelection in Pennsylvania s 16th Congressional District. which covers the northwest corner of the Keystone State. In 2020. Trump defeated President Joe Biden among the district s voters by more than 20 percentage points.Pastore s struggle to raise large sums of money has prevented him from advertising on television thus far in the race.,Politics News

I had no idea. To think that there would be a Republican with that name ― that was unbelievable.  Asked whether she thought the Republican candidate s campaign had been clear about his political position in its messaging. Gordon replied.  I can t say yes.  Gardner told HuffPost that she believes the Doyle campaign is not going out of its way to make a clear distinction between the Democratic veteran and the Republican newbie. She said that some voters told her they just weren t thinking when they saw Doyle listed as a Republican. because Pennsylvania allows candidates to cross-file to multiple parties in certain other elections. including school board and judicial seats.Democrats for DoyleThe Doyle campaign pushed back on the accusations in a statement.reformtold an opinion columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazettein the same newspaper My name is on the ballot.  he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette two weeks ago.

Bike safety advocates in Pennsylvania have spent the past five years trying to convince lawmakers to change an outdated law to allow for safer bike lanes on state roads. This year. it seemed like they might finally prevail. A bill to amend the state s vehicle code passed unanimously out of the state House and headed to the state Senate. But instead of putting it up for a vote there. Republican lawmakers tied the previously uncontroversial bike lane bill to a completely unrelated GOP policy goal: undermining Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. Republican lawmakers have worked to undermine Krasner since he was first elected in 2017 on a promise to reduce incarceration and dramatically reform the criminal justice system. This week. the GOP s yearslong sabotage campaign reached a dramatic milestone when House Republicans filed articles of impeachment against Krasner. blaming the progressive prosecutor for an increase in crime in Philadelphia — a trend that has been occurring across the state and country. Although Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. they are unlikely to actually remove Krasner from office. which would require support from two-thirds of the Senate. Instead. they have tried to push a series of laws containing sneaky provisions that would strip Krasner of his ability to decide how and whether to prosecute certain crimes. That s where the bike lane bill comes in. Pennsylvania s Vehicle Code currently requires cars to park with their tires within 12 inches of a curb. This prevents the installation of parking-protected bike lanes. which sit between a curb and a parking lane. shielding bicyclists from moving traffic. Even the small number of parking-protected bike lanes that exist as part of a pilot program have been linked to increased ridership and a decrease in crashes and fatalities. according to a recent study. A legislative fix to Pennsylvania s vehicle code was introduced in 2017 but faced persistent resistancefrom state Sen. John Sabatina (D). who represented northeast Philadelphia. Last year. Sabatina resigned from the state Senate after being elected to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. clearing the way for the bike lane bill to pass. After passing unanimously in the state House last year. the bill moved to the Senate. In June. state Sen. Wayne Langerholc (R). who chairs the state Senate transportation committee and represents a district four hours outside of Philadelphia. quietly introduced an amendment just before the bike lane bill was scheduled for a committee vote. The amendment tasked the state s attorney general with appointing a special prosecutor in counties  of the first class  to handle crimes committed on public transportation. A first-class county is defined as a county with a population of 1.500.000 or more. and there is only one in the state — Philadelphia County.  We did not see it coming.  Sarah Clark Stuart. the executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia. said in an interview.  It was never raised in any of the conversations that we had with the senator or his staff.  The bike lane bill was amended again earlier this week to put a panel of judges. rather than the attorney general. in charge of selecting the special prosecutor. In case the intention of the amendment wasn t explicit enough. the special prosecutor cannot be anyone who worked in the district attorney s office during the time that Krasner was DA and cannot initiate any new proceedings after Dec. 31. 2025 — a week before Krasner s term ends. That version passed the state Senate on a party-line vote.If signed into law. the amended bike lane bill would result in a deeply undemocratic scenario in which lawmakers who do not represent Philadelphia voters have stripped a popular elected official of his ability to oversee certain cases. Instead. those cases would be handled by an appointed prosecutor whom voters didn t elect.Consider one example of how this might play out: Abortion is currently legal in Pennsylvania up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. but far-right gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano has previously said women who get abortions should be charged with murder. If Republicans maintain control of the state House and Senate and have Mastriano as governor. it is conceivable that Pennsylvania could pass far more restrictive abortion laws. And even if Krasner declined to prosecute abortion-related crimes in Philadelphia. that decision may be out of his control. If. for example. a woman took public transportation to an abortion clinic. her case could fall within the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor created under the amended bike lane bill. they could no longer support What we saw was a fairly minor redefining of what a curb is in the vehicle code. This is fixing a technicality — and folks made it political.  Scott Bricker. the executive director of BikePGH. said in an interview.  It s very disappointing to us because these types of safe street designs save lives. they encourage more people to ride. they encourage new people to take up bicycling. they prevent injuries. It s really just a shame.  The bike lane bill was one of several pieces of legislation Republican lawmakers have used to try to take away Krasner s prosecutorial discretion. Another bill pushed by the GOP would give the state attorney general the ability to prosecute certain gun cases in Philadelphia County. State Rep. Martina White (R). who announced the filing of articles of impeachment against Krasner earlier this week. managed to pass a similar version of this bill in 2019 by quietly slipping the language into the bill in the final days of the legislative session.  I think the vast majority of my colleagues had no idea this was included.  a state House Democratic lawmaker told The Intercept at the time. However. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro declined to use that law to undercut Krasner. and it expired in 2021 near the conclusion of Krasner s first term. Shapiro is now running for governor against Mastriano. If Shapiro wins that race. there will be a special election for state attorney general. and Republicans will have a shot at replacing Shapiro with a prosecutor who would be happy to strip Krasner of prosecutorial discretion.Republicans also filed an amendment to a previously uncontroversial billthat would require law enforcement to make an effort to contact family members before publicly identifying a murder victim. The amendment. which was never voted on. would have allowed a panel of judges to appoint a special prosecutor to Philadelphia County to handle a broad range of crimes including car theft. illegal gun possession or sales. and  any other criminal matter  if the special prosecutor determines that Krasner has opted not to enforce all or part of a law. It is unclear if either of the current legislative efforts to constrain Krasner will pass this session. But the focus on Krasner provides a convenient way for Republican lawmakers to sell a  tough-on-crime  message to voters days before the midterm elections — a convenient distraction from Republicans  refusal to pass laws to restrict access to the guns used to kill the crime victims they claim to want to protect.  Crime is a serious issue. and the DA takes it seriously ― as do the people who live in Philadelphia. members of City Council. and all others who were elected by Philadelphians to govern there.  said Jessica Brand. a spokesperson for Krasner s office.  It is why they are all begging legislators in Harrisburg to pass common sense gun control and to fund equitable schools.  Brand continued.  It s why they are pushing for more job training and for services in all communities. not just the wealthy ones. That s where the DA hopes the focus can be going forward. because that s how we stop violence and build up communities.  ,Politics News
Joe Biden Can t believe I have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families.  Biden wrote in a post on Twitter.most of any quarteraccording to BloombergBiden has repeatedly slammed oil companies for using their skyrocketing profits to buy back stock and reward shareholders instead of boosting production in order to provide consumers relief at the pump. He furthered that attack ahead of the third-quarter earnings blitz. My message to the American energy companies is this: You should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends.  Biden said during a speech last week at the White House.  Not now. Not while a war is raging. You should use those record-breaking profits to increase production and refining. Invest in America for the American people. nearly $50 billionsurveyedDuring a speech in Syracuse. New York. on Thursday. Biden highlighted that gas prices have come down in recent weeks. but stressed that they d be even lower if not for industry profiteering. There used to be a direct correlation: A barrel of oil goes down. the price at the pump goes down at the same time.  he said.  If we re taking average profits they ve been making over the last 20 years instead of the historic profits they re making today. the price of gas would be down an additional 40 cents today.  And by the way. last quarter. the five largest oil companies made — in the last quarter — $70 billion in profit in 90 days. ,Politics News
When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called a press conference in August to announce illegal voting charges against 20 Floridians with prior felony convictions ― all of whom seem not to have intentionally broken the law. but rather fallen victim to a confusing voter registration system ― a chill went over the state.a constitutional amendment to restore former felons  voting rights We ve already encountered other individuals who have said. ‘Look. I m afraid to vote.   said Mike Gottlieb. a Democratic state legislator who s on the legal defense team for one of the men facing charges.told News Service of FloridaGottlieb said he believed that DeSantis  press conference. held in a courtroom in Florida s bluest county. Broward. was  specifically designed to disenfranchise Democratic voters in Broward County  ― an accusation that a Florida Department of State spokesperson called  blatantly false. Nonetheless. news of the arrests quickly reverberated across the state. It s had a major chilling effect.  Gottlieb said.  I think they ve accomplished their goal. There are going to be people who are not interested in voting because they are concerned that they re going to be arrested. Neil Volz said he has seen a similar response to the arrests. Volz is deputy director at the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. a group dedicated to helping returning citizens ― that is. formerly incarcerated people ― who have prior convictions. We re seeing individuals who. because of the confusion. might not participate this year.  said Volz. who is himself a returning citizen.  It s gut-wrenching to think that the de facto decision somebody needs to make. when they re confused about whether they re eligible or not. is to not vote. After Florida s Amendment 4 passed in 2018. former felons who d completed any sentence. parole or probation for their convictions were automatically granted their voting rights back. with the exception of people convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses. But within months. the Republican-controlled Florida legislature additionally required felons to pay back all fines and fees related to their sentence before they could regain their rights ― forcing returning citizens to navigate a county-by-county patchwork of court records that can feel impossible to untangle. In Alachua County earlier this year. months before DeSantis  press conference. 10 Floridians were charged for voting illegally. although most of them had been registered to vote by county officials during a jailhouse registration drive. All of them owed fines and fees from previous charges. Fresh Take Florida reported. The evidence against one defendant included $494 in unpaid fines that dated as far back as 1994. according to Orlando Weekly.There s no evidence that any of the people who DeSantis mentioned in his August press conference actually meant to break the law. But all of the defendants DeSantis announced had been convicted of murder or felony sex offenses. making them ineligible for automatic voter restoration. Yet no one stopped them from registering.Rather. the defendants say they were told by various parties ― election officials. canvassers. a probation officer and even a sheriff s deputy ― that they were eligible to vote. according to court records reported by the Orlando Sentinel. They were issued voter registration cards by the state. and they used them. Months later. police officers arrived at their doors.Body camera footage published by the Tampa Bay Times last week showed the moments the Floridians realized that they d essentially been misled into thinking they were eligible to vote.  I m like. what the hell? Voter fraud?  Romona Oliver says in one of the videos.  I voted. but I ain t commit no fraud. One of the officers arresting her seems similarly confused.  That s the thing. I don t know exactly what happened with it. but you do have a warrant. and that s what it s for.  he says. Another video shows Florida resident Nathan Hart telling officers that he d been told.  If you can vote. then they ll give you a card. and if you can t vote. then they won t.   There s your defense.  an officer replies.In another video. Tony Patterson stews in the back of a police car:  Why would you let me vote if I wasn t able to vote?  I m not sure. buddy.  an officer responds.  I don t know.  Elsewhere. he says:  I ve never seen these charges before in my entire life.   The ultimate responsibility to ensure compliance with the law lies with the voter. as local and state election officials are obliged to take the word of the voter on the voter application ― affirmations made under penalty of perjury.  Mark Ard. a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State. told HuffPost.  These individuals lied when they registered to vote.  Ard said.A New York Times reviewentered a pretrial diversion programAt the press conference in August. DeSantis painted the prosecutions as an  opening salvo  against voter fraud. promising more prosecutions to come. (Only one other case has been charged since.)And the late Pete Antonacci. who DeSantis had appointed head of his new Office of Election Crimes and Security. claimed without evidence that he was  certain  there had been  plenty of illegal ballots cast  in a recent Democratic primary.Volz. of the FRRC. said the state could spend money on creating a system that actually works to check eligibility on the front end. rather than leaving voters in the dark and arresting people who mistakenly vote despite not being qualified. Instead of spending money fixing the front end of the system. we re spending money on law enforcement and the court system. and we re seeing people s lives upended because of it.  he said.  The state responded to a broken system by criminalizing voting. So far. the prosecutions aren t going well for the state. Last week. a Miami judge dismissed the case against Robert Lee Wood. one of the defendants announced at DeSantis  press conference. because the alleged crime had been committed in just one county. meaning it ought to have been prosecuted by the local state attorney. not the Office of Statewide Prosecution. Local prosecutors probably wouldn t take these cases. because the likelihood of conviction would be low at best.  Larry Davis. an attorney for Wood. told HuffPost.The state has said it will appeal the case. but Davis said he was prepared to argue on the substance of his client s actions:  He had no intent to break the law. Jonathan Olson. a supervisor in the state attorney s office in Lake County. Florida. articulated the same concern this month while declining to take six cases in which the office had verified that ineligible voters had cast ballots.Olson wrote in a statement The evidence fails to show willful actions on a part of these individuals.  Olson wrote.  Therefore. the State is unable to file charges. The state took the opposite route. sending a shock to hundreds of thousands of eligible Floridians with previous felony convictions who nonetheless haven t yet registered to vote.Ard said the Department of State receives daily reports of registered voters with potential felonies on their records. but that the process to screen whether the registrations pass muster is done manually. In sum. and as courts have noted. it is easy to be put on the rolls and difficult to be removed.  Ard said.  This is as it should be. Should Floridians wish to see this process changed. they should contact their legislative representative to change the current statutes. Volz said the atmosphere in Florida today reminds him of the days he spent campaigning for the passage of Amendment 4. a statewide vote of Floridians who still had their rights. to extend the franchise to those the state had excluded from society. Volz and other returning citizens couldn t vote on the amendment themselves. Now. Floridians concerned about facing charges simply for voting are in the same situation. We are seeing some of this energy turned towards getting out the vote. and making sure that the voices of returning citizens are being heard ― even if it s through their friends and neighbors and loved ones.  Volz said. To see that rebirth is really interesting.  he said.  It gives us hope. ,Politics News

Nancy PelosiSan Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said officers arrived at Pelosi s house for a  well-being check  at around 2:27 a.m.. where they saw Paul Pelosi and an adult male both holding a hammer.  The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it.  Scott said.  Our officers immediately tackled the suspect. disarmed him. took him into custody. requested emergency backup. and rendered medical aid. Scott identified the suspect as a 42-year-old named David DePape. The man will be charged with attempted homicide. assault with a deadly weapon. elder abuse and burglary. Both Pelosi and DePape were taken to a hospital. Scott said.

Texas Democrats are betting they could win their first statewide election in three decades by ousting an entrenched Republican incumbent from a seat on a confusingly named regulatory commission no one has heard of that oversees the oil and gas industry.The man to pull off what would be a seismic upset is a relatively recent arrival to the Lone Star State. a Rhode Island native who bounced between London. New York City. Washington. D.C.. San Francisco and Ethiopia before settling in Austin. Luke Warford wants to become a member of the Texas Railroad Commission — and thereby a sheriff for the state s storied oil industry. Slim and bespectacled. with a stylish swoop of wavy hair. the first-time candidate doesn t exactly look the part. By his own admission.  people look at me and they ask about the Green New Deal and AOC.  Warford says he s a pragmatist who wants to see the oil industry thrive — and that it would be madness to reelect a regulator under whose watch the Texas natural gas system collapsed. leaving hundreds to freeze to death and thousands more to foot exorbitant electric bills.So goes the 33-year-old s pitch to persuade Texans to put him in charge of policing the state s most valuable industry in the midst of a global energy crisis. Ousting the incumbent Republican. Wayne Christian. and electing a Democrat to one of the Texas Railroad Commission s three seats won t end Republican control.  Following a 2011 cold snap. federal regulators warned the Railroad Commission that its 255.000-mile network of natural gas lines was vulnerable to extreme temperatures. The GOP commissioners declined to set any rules requiring pipeline owners to weatherize their infrastructure. Instead of investing in those retrofits. the pipeline companies poured money into the incumbents  campaign coffers. Sure enough. when Winter Storm Uri brought freakish arctic temperatures to Texas in February 2021. gas pipelines froze just as badly-insulated homes were demanding more electricity and fuel to stay warm. A BuzzFeed News investigation estimates that at least 700 people — nearly  Because of their corruption. these elected officials — my opponent — ignored the warnings and hundreds of Texans fucking froze to death in the energy capital of the world.  Warford said during an hour-long interview this month.  That is unconscionable.  Wayne Christian s long track record offers easy fodder to vilify the incumbent. A Grammy-nominated gospel singer who first won a state legislative seat in 1998. Christian quietly voted in 2009 to give his own beach house an exemption from a state law banning construction on public shorelines. Earlier this year. Christian went against the Railroad Commission staff s advice and approved an oil-waste dump mere feet from a vital aquifer. Three days later. the company behind the dump gave Christian a $100.000 campaign donation. the Odessa American first reported. That may not break any laws. but Houston Chronicle columnist Chris Tomlinson wrote in February that Christian  demonstrated what at best is a profound disregard for ethics. and at worst. engaged in public corruption.  Christian. who did not respond to emailed questions. dismissed the allegations earlier this year to Texas Monthly as  mudslinging.  But his six-year tenure on the Railroad Commission proved unpopular enough that three Republicans challenged him for his seat in this year s primary. Last month. Sarah Stogner. the Republican candidate who came in second to Christian in May s primary runoff. endorsed Warford.  I m a lifelong Republican.  Stogner said in an ad she cut with Warford. noting that she was crossing party lines  because our energy industry is too important to let corrupt politicians like Wayne Christian stay in office. In a statewide survey by the Democratic pollster Data for Progress in August. roughly 85% of 636 likely voters said they didn t know enough about Christian or Warford to decide which candidate they favored.After those surveyed read the candidates  biographies and saw negative and positive messaging on both. Christian came out just two points ahead of Warford. suggesting it could be a tight race if the Democrat reaches enough voters. Donors are excited about Warford. who outraised Christian 3–1 in the final few months of the race and has nearly twice as much cash on hand. But a six-figure war chest can only do so much in a nation-sized state when you re an unknown candidate running for an unknown office against an unknown incumbent whose unknown scandals are relatively complex.  It s an uphill battle.  said Brandon Rottinghaus. a political science professor at the University of Houston.  Every Texas Democrat is facing strong headwinds in a bad year for Democrats across the country.  Deadly as they were. the power outages took place 20 months ago. before the economy sank into greater chaos. nuclear war became a serious threat again. and a gunman massacred Texas schoolchildren.  The grid is a resonant issue. but getting attention to the issue. which many Texans consider solved. is a challenge.  Rottinghaus said.  What s more. getting attention to the issue for a candidate who is not well known and to an office that is obscure to most voters. Warford cultivated 18.000 followers on TikTok with videos teasing Christian for refusing to debate him and riding around on Texas  little-used passenger railway. In recent weeks. he went on a tour of colleges. hoping to turn out young voters who often sit out midterm elections when a Democrat is president. They might take to some of Warford s flashier rhetoric. which includes shirts and hats that read  UNF*CK THE GRID.  Among his most concrete policy platforms is a pledge to  establish a clear weatherization standard. identify critical gas producers. and ensure preparations for the next winter storm are actually completed.  At a moment when climate advocates are vandalizing prized works of art to protest any new oil and gas production. Warford s self-described pragmatism might clash with the ideals of some campus activist types.  ‘Leave it in the ground  is not a realistic option right now.  he said.  This is a thing I think Democrats get wrong a lot. Even the most aggressive transitions to net zero have continued oil and gas use for a long time.  A clearer path to victory cuts through the deep-red. rural counties where uncapped oil wells contaminate well water and pose a routine risk of exploding. said Colin Strother. a moderate Democratic strategist in Texas who is not working on Warford s campaign. The Republicans on the Railroad Commission have refused to take responsibility for wells that never produced any oil or gas. sticking landowners with pollution and costly cleanup. He should probably get the list of the top 20 counties with the most uncapped oil wells. and he should probably go to all those counties and say. ‘elect me and I ll cap these next year.   Strother said.  You take somewhere like Gregg County. which has some of the most uncapped oil wells in Texas. It s a solidly Republican county. But they re very much affected by that issue.  Having run against Christian as a 20-something rookie candidate for the statehouse in 1998. Strother warned that the Republican was a formidable opponent with allies who would likely tap deep financial resources if Warford became a serious threat.  Wayne Christian is a political animal. He s a right-wing evangelical Christian. This guy was tea party before it was cool.  Strother said.  He holds a very. very powerful position as it relates to the oil and gas industry in Texas. he does whatever they tell him to do. and therefore. they re going to make sure he has whatever funding he needs to compete.  But Chrysta Castañeda. a former Exxon Mobil Corp. lawyer and 2020 Democratic nominee for the Railroad Commission who lost with 44% of the vote. said Warford s fate is tied to those of other Democrats running this cycle.  If Luke outperforms. then several statewide will outperform and it ll be a very good day for Democrats.  said Castañeda. who recently published a book on oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens.  What s really going to move the needle in Texas for statewide races is a committed investment by our party structure to persuade people outside the core constituencies that Democrats already have.  Warford. for his part. thinks he can win over industry stalwarts by presenting himself as a modernizer capable of securing Texas oil s place in the 21st century. After graduating from the University of Delaware and heading to England to complete a master s degree at the London School of Economics. Warford joined the globe-trotting consultant set. working for the World Bank. the African Union. Airbnb. Spotify. and. he said. a handful of oil. gas and renewable energy companies. A few weeks ago. Warford said. he visited Pioneer Energy Services in Irving. Texas. and was struck by the massive control room where the drilling company runs its operations remotely.  It s a technology company that s taking oil and gas out of the ground. it s not an oil and gas company.  Warford said.  The thing I usually lean into here in these discussions is that I m very much of the technology generation. and technology — artificial intelligence. machine learning — it s going to play a massive role in the future of the energy industry.  Regulators are always  trailing behind the industry by 20 or 30 years.  he added. noting that  there s a huge cost there to progress and innovation and to economic growth.  stepped in to delayWarford also thinks he can help the Texas energy companies win a major share of growing global markets for carbon capture technology and clean-burning hydrogen fuel. While electrons from a solar panel or nuclear reactor can replace fuel in electric vehicles or induction stovetops. many parts of the economy still need energy in molecules that burn hot like gas or oil.Fossil fuel producers like Qatar. the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands have invested heavily in producing low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen. which produces no carbon dioxide when ignited. While most hydrogen on the market today is made using gas or coal. machines called electrolysers can split the world s most abundant element from its paired oxygen atom in water to make H2. If those electrolysers are powered with solar. wind or nuclear energy. then the hydrogen produced is more or less carbon-free.  Getting ahead of the curve would be great. so when this market materializes ... we already have the processes in place to take advantage of it.  said Joshua Rhodes. an energy research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.  Right now. it doesn t seem like the Railroad Commission is that interested in hydrogen. so that can create regulatory uncertainty. which can drive up the cost.  Even on carbon capture and storage — the as-yet-unscaled technology oil and gas companies say will allow them to filter planet-heating pollution from their smokestacks — Texas is behind other major fossil-fuel-producing states. Permitting wells to inject captured CO2 for permanent storage takes years. While states such as North Dakota and Wyoming already won approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to carry out their own permitting without additional federal oversight. Texas only started seriously pushing its application for regulatory  primacy  earlier this year.  I m running against a mid-70s career politician who thinks it s still 1980. and who used the grid failure as an opportunity to advance his political allies and criticize renewables. He s anti-technology and anti-growth and anti-progress.  Warford said.  That tends to resonate with people.  Warford came to Texas seeking some stability. Near the end of his jet-setting 20s. both of his parents died. Hoping to settle down. he followed friends to Austin and fell in love with a fifth-generation Texan. He wants to raise kids with her.But February last year was a wake-up call. They lost power for three days. and the temperature inside their Austin apartment fell to 38 degrees Fahrenheit. They ran out of food and had no running water. Yet they spent the storm driving around in Warford s all-wheel-drive vehicle. trying to deliver food to those in more dire straits.  Texans take care of each other and look out for each other. and our elected officials were doing the exact opposite in our time of crisis. That s the thing that pissed me off so much.  Warford said.  I know what it s like to lose someone unnecessarily and to be robbed of good years with people. and you have all these people grieving unnecessary losses.  he said.  The decision to run wasn t too much more complicated than. do I want to spend the next year of my life prosecuting this case of the absolutely egregious. fucked-up corruption and failure? ,Politics News

Elon MuskThe message appears aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter s chief source of revenue — that Musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.an uncharacteristically long messageHe continued:  There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society. Musk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter s dependence on it. suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won t allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday. he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be  the most respected advertising platform in the world.  The note is a shift from Musk s position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content. said Pinar Yildirim. associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania s Wharton School.But it s also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business. putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers. she said. You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about. and the platform takes no responsibility.  Yildirim said.Musk said Twitter should be  warm and welcoming to all  and enable users to choose the experience they want to have. I didn t do it to make money.  he said of the pending acquisition.

Despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company s culture and operations. Twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed Musk s arrival and messaging.Top sales executive Sarah Personette. the company s chief customer officer. said she had a  great discussion  with Musk on Wednesday and appeared to endorse his Thursday message to advertisers. Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged.  Personette tweeted Thursday.  Looking forward to the future! Musk s apparent enthusiasm about visiting Twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions: The building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there.reported last weekMusk has spent months deriding Twitter s  spam bots  and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about Twitter s problems and how to fix them.

Even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers. many of whom already find Twitter s brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lucianne Goldberg. a literary agent and key figure in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. has died at the age of 87.on TwitterLucianne Goldberg. a longtime conservative activist whose agency specialized in right-wing books. gained national prominence for advising her friend Linda Tripp to secretly tape Tripp s conversations with Lewinsky. a former White House intern who had been involved in a sexual relationship with Clinton.Tripp s 20 hours of tapes of her conversations with Lewinsky were crucial to special prosecutor Kenneth Starr s investigation of Clinton over his affair with Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19. 1998 for denying under oath that he had had sex with Lewinsky. but he was acquitted by the Senate.A longtime Clinton foe. Goldberg had met Tripp while working on a proposal for a book on the death of Vince Foster. a Clinton aide whose suicide sparked conservative conspiracy theories. It was Goldberg who told her friend the recordings would be legal ― they weren t ― and then encouraged her to break Lewinsky s trust and give them to Starr. Goldberg later said she was glad Clinton had been caught  at something. an article published amid the fallout from the Lewinsky tapes.Goldberg also wrote racy novels and worked as a ghostwriter for celebrities.Her earlier career included the 1970 co-founding of a group called the Pussycat League that campaigned against feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment.Goldberg was born Lucianne Steinberger in Boston.

All summer. Republicans claimed the U.S. economy was in a recession because the country s overall economic growth went negative for the first half of the year.  Everything about the Biden Recession was predictable — and avoidable.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proclaimed in July.  Only Democrats in Washington chose not to see it coming. McCarthy and others argued that two quarters of negative growth automatically amounted to a recession — even though recessions usually involve mass job loss. not just negative growth. And there s been nothing but rapid job growth this year. On Thursday. the Commerce Department announced the economy grew in the third quarter. The positive growth doesn t mean there s no recession lurking around the corner ― but it does mean that if one had already started this year. it was really mild. involved no widespread layoffs. and the unemployment rate remained near historic lows the entire time. In a statement reacting to the 2.6% increase in gross domestic product. President Joe Biden did a victory lap around his haters.  For months. doomsayers have been arguing that the U.S. economy is in a recession and congressional Republicans have been rooting for a downturn.  Biden said.  But today we got further evidence that our economic recovery is continuing to power forward. It s true that two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth are commonly considered by economists to be a recession indicator. And it s true that a contracting economy is bad. But declaring a recession has always involved a lot more than one simple data point. The Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research. a private nonprofit organization. keeps the official score of when recessions start and end. The NBER calls recessions after the fact. so if one had happened earlier this year. they wouldn t have said so at the time. But as they explain on their website. they look at much more than just GDP. such as measures of personal income. employment. consumer spending and industrial production. And they even state that  real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting  a recession call. RepublicansRep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas). the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. claimed Thursday that  economists have dumbed down economic projections to reflect [Biden s] struggling policies.  And Brady said the GDP report was not actually positive.  A major surge in exports and government spending produced a fleeting positive number ― ‘ghost growth  ― while the key drivers of the economy such as investment and consumer spending shrunk again.  Brady said. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). chair of the Joint Economic Committee. said the Commerce Department s Bureau of Economic Analysis. which produces the GDP numbers. is staffed by conscientious career economists. not a bunch of Democrats. He said it was unfortunate Republicans continuously denigrate institutions.  This goes along with. ‘You can t trust the FBI. You can t trust [the Department of] Justice. the IRS is out to screw you.  The whole thought of not trusting the institutions that make our country the best in the world.  Beyer told HuffPost.Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.). the top Republican on the Budget Committee. said it could still turn out a recession is upon us.  In the recession of 2007-2009. America saw a negative quarter of GDP followed by a brief uptick before subsequent quarters of negative growth.  Smith said Thursday.It s entirely possible that the economy will enter a recession within the next year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. slowing the entire economy in an effort to slow inflation. The Fed has projected that unemployment could rise significantly in 2023. What s odd about the Republicans insisting on a recession now is that the American people are plenty upset about the economy because of high inflation that has shown no sign of abating — and it s giving Republicans an advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. Even without a recession. the economy has been a drag for Democrats.,Politics News

Mark Lee Dickson has made it his life s work to criminalize abortion in the state of Texas. A pastor and the head of Right to Life of East Texas — as well as a self-identified  36-year-old virgin  — Dickson traveled to 400 Texas cities in 2019. encouraging towns to declare themselves  sanctuary cities for the unborn  and pass ordinances outlawing abortion. He was successful. aiding the passage of nearly 50 ordinances banning abortion in cities in Texas and a handful of other states.His achievements on the road jump-started his career as one of the most well-known anti-abortion advocates in the country.Dickson s legislative strategy for banning abortions at the city level paved the way for Texas  vigilante-enforced six-week abortion ban that went into effect last year. The anti-abortion advocate. along with attorney and former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell. formulated an enforcement mechanism that would circumvent any legal or court challenges: delegating enforcement to private citizens. rather than law enforcement or other government agencies. That played out in cities across Texas. until Dickson and Mitchell took their idea statewide. With the help of Texas Republicans. Dickson helped craft Senate Bill 8 ― the most extreme abortion restriction at the time ― which financially incentivized private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets Texans trying to get an abortion past the six-week point. Unlike other recent attempts to ban abortion early in pregnancy. S.B. 8 was able to survive legal challenges when Roe v. Wade was still the law of the land. The measure. arguably one of the first major warning signs that Roe would soon fall. was a huge victory for abortion opponents like Dickson.Fast-forward a full year. and Roe is dead. Over a dozen states including Texas have enacted near-total abortion bans. forcing many Americans to travel to other states to receive care.Dickson. triumphant in Texas. has now turned his sights to New Mexico ― a state where many Texans have fled to access critical abortion care.Two New Mexico towns near the Texas border are discussing abortion bans within their city limits that will come to a vote in the coming weeks. and a handful of other communities in the area. including the city of Lovington and Lea County. are discussing similar measures. The city council in Clovis. a farming town in eastern New Mexico. will vote Nov. 3 on an ordinance that seeks to ban abortion providers and criminalize sending medication abortion. or abortion pills. by mail. And the city commission in Hobbs. a town about 2 1/2 hours south of Clovis. voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to proceed with an ordinance to ban abortion. A final vote in Hobbs is set for Nov. 7.Dickson has been a central figure behind both of these proposals.He s been in communication with Clovis residents for more than a year to make the town a  sanctuary city for the unborn.  Dickson told Eastern New Mexico News earlier this month. All I did was answer a call. All I did was go where the Lord was calling me to go.  said Dickson.  I did not go forward thinking I could do this on my own. I went forward saying. ‘God help me. God help this city. I can t do this alone. We can t do this alone. We are going to need your help.  Dickson spoke at an anti-abortion rally in Hobbs earlier this month. alongside other abortion opponents from Texas and New Mexico. He can also be seen cheering in the background of a Hobbs City Commission meeting after an all-male board voted unanimously to proceed with an ordinance banning abortion.Neither Clovis or Hobbs have abortion clinics within their city limits. but some reproductive health organizations have expressed interest in expanding abortion services to cities that border Texas to accommodate for the influx of patients traveling to New Mexico. Amy Hagstrom Miller. president and CEO of Whole Woman s Health. recently said she d like to offer services in or around Clovis. Hobbs and Roswell. another New Mexico town near the Texas border.Dickson is trying to preempt any such move.  We know that abortion providers want to set up right here in these cities that are just minutes away from the Texas border.  Dickson told Reuters after a recent Hobbs City Commission meeting.  They want to attract as many Texas residents as possible for abortions right here in New Mexico. Both the Clovis and Hobbs ordinances are likely to face legal challenges if passed. but similar measures in Texas. also spearheaded by Dickson. have survived past lawsuits. There are currently eight abortion clinics in New Mexico. The closest for Clovis and Hobbs residents are located in Albuquerque. which is a four- to five-hour drive away.Many Texans and Oklahomans have fled to New Mexico in order to access abortion care in the last year. Since 2021. when Texas  vigilante abortion ban went into effect. New Mexico has taken on a flood of Texas patients. with one clinic reporting that it was booked four weeks out and 75% of its patients were from Texas. In the wake of Roe s reversal. the Southwestern state has become home to several clinics that were forced to shut down and relocate including Jackson Women s Health Organization. the Mississippi clinic at the center of the Supreme Court case that ended nationwide abortion protections.New Mexico is also one of five states that offer crucial abortion care later in pregnancy because there is no legal limit on abortion in the state.There s a chance. though a slim one. that the upcoming elections could change that. Joe Biden won New Mexico with a nearly 11% margin of victory over Donald Trump in the 2020 election. and Democrats hold the governor s seat and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature. It s a largely pro-choice state. although some pockets ― including rural areas like the ones Dickson is targeting ― lean more conservative.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) currently leads her GOP rival. abortion opponent Mark Ronchetti. by about 7.5 points in the polls. Dickson has endorsed Ronchetti several times. most recently posting a photo of himself with the candidate on Facebook and writing Ronchetti would  be a serious upgrade  from Lujan Grisham.During his primary. Ronchetti ran on a  strongly pro-life  platform in which he said he would oppose abortion  at all stages  and that  unborn babies have souls. can feel emotions. and are every bit a human being.  But after Roe fell this summer. Ronchetti started walking back his strong anti-abortion views ― seemingly taking a page out of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin s (R) playbook.Now. Ronchetti is painting himself as a moderate. saying he would  seek a middle ground on abortion  and calling for a 15-week ban. Just last month Ronchetti ran a campaign ad again downplaying his anti-abortion stance and proposing a statewide vote on a constitutional amendment on abortion to  give people a voice. But Dickson is still supporting Ronchetti. During the Clovis City Commission meeting earlier this month. Dickson claimed he and Ronchetti recently discussed the abortion ban ordinances. I was talking to Mark Ronchetti. and I was telling him a while back about what was happening here tonight. And I said. you know. this is what you re talking about … among the people. the communities deciding this issue.  Dickson said while speaking to the city commission board. I said. when Clovis does this. don t waste the opportunity.  he continued.  Stand with the people of Clovis. stand with the people of Hobbs. stand with the people of New Mexico that are pro-life and want to see this state. these counties. these cities. move forward with the heart of what New Mexicans truly believe. Lujan Grisham s campaign told HuffPost in a statement that voters should know what Dickson and the potential new governor talked about. Ronchetti owes New Mexicans full transparency about what he said to the Texas abortion ban activist who is trying to import his extremist policies to New Mexico.  said Delaney Corcoran. a spokesperson for the governor s reelection campaign. ,Politics News

A team led by lawyer Marc Elias and his firm is litigating roughly 40 cases in 19 states. though many are interventions in Republican-led suits.Elias said he is bracing for a deluge of challenges to election results. Some Republican candidates have already said they will not accept a loss or have planted doubt on the election process despite no evidence of fraud. The problem with the Republican Party right now is that conceding you lost an election is the only thing that will hurt you.  Elias said.  Contesting an election that is clearly lost is now where all the incentive structure is. and that is incredibly corrosive for democracy. Almost every election begets legal challenges. But the much of that generally comes after Election Day.Those suits were roundly rejected.the falsehoods have taken rootGinsberg said unsubstantiated charges that elections were fraudulent or rigged or unreliable have became the mantra for a Republican to win a contested 2022 primary in most states. That can only harm public faith in elections. something for which Republicans will eventually pay a price.  he said.RNC was under a consent decreeIn 2020.

voting machine conspiracy theoriesAfter a full day in the Nye County office building in Pahrump. 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Las Vegas. some 60 volunteers had counted about 900 of the 1.950 mail-in ballots that the county has received so far.It was the first day that counting could start under a state Supreme Court ruling that said officials must prevent the public release of early results. The court also blocked a plan to livestream the vote-counting. saying video could be released only after polls close on Nov. 8.The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada unsuccessfully sought to block the counting on the grounds that it could allow election results to be made public before many voters had even weighed in.The ACLU was preparing to ask the state high court to intervene again. spokesman Wesley Juhl said Wednesday night. The ACLU contends the county failed to comply with Friday s order. It s an embarrassing day for our democracy. A historic disaster is brewing in Nye County.  ACLU Nevada executive director Athar Haseebullah said in a statement after watching the first several hours of ballot counting.Juhl said an armed volunteer removed an ACLU observer from one room and attempted to take her notes.Nye County. an old silver mining region between Las Vegas and Reno. is home to about 50.000 residents. including 33.000 registered voters. It s best known as the home of the nation s former nuclear weapons test site.Nevada has one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country. as well as high-stakes contests for governor and the office that oversees elections.Two groups of five that The Associated Press observed Wednesday spent about three hours each counting 50 ballots. Mismatched tallies led to recounts. and occasionally more recounts. Several noted how arduous the process was. with one volunteer lamenting:  I can t believe it s two hours to get through 25  ballots.Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf emphasized throughout the day to  take it nice and slow.  In an interview. he declared the first day a success and said.  It was a process of learning here. As one person announced candidate names aloud. a verifier looked over her shoulder and three talliers marked sheets of paper. A print-out instruction sheet on a wall across from a video camera above their table urged them to  FOCUS. FOCUS  on each name that was read.One group observed by AP found during their first 30 minutes that they had mismatched numbers for eight candidates. A recount took nearly 40 minutes. and two of the recounts still had different outcomes. That s going to be my new name. Mismatch.  said one of the talliers. It s our first day. don t feel bad.  the verifier replied.  As long as we catch  em.  It will get better.  Kampf later told the group.The secretary of state s office said Nye County had to split teams into separate rooms so anyone observing the count of early in-person and mailed ballots would not know the  totality of returns.  Participants were not identified for the media.In a letter sent Tuesday to Nevada secretary of state election officials. though. the ACLU warned that the reading of candidate names aloud within earshot of public observers constituted  a release of election results in violation of Nevada law. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly said officials could not respond to questions about the letter because the case was before the state Supreme Court.Jennifer Russell. spokeswoman for Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. also did not have a response to the ACLU letter.Observers were required to sign a form saying they won t release results they overhear. Anyone who does could be charged with a gross misdemeanor.The AP was not not allowed to photograph the proceedings.The concern over safeguarding the tallies is because the process is so unusual. Ballots cast early. either in-person or by mail. are typically counted by machine on Election Day. with results released only after polls close. In most places. hand counts are used after an election on a limited basis to ensure machine tallies are accurate.two years of conspiracy theoriesvoting machinesthe 2020 presidential electionTrump won 69% of the vote in Nye County even as President Joe Biden won Nevada by about 33.500 votes.Nye County wanted to start counting its early ballots before Election Day rather than risk missing the state s Nov. 17 certification deadline.no evidence of widespread fraudmanipulation of machinesKampf has described the county s Dominion tabulator machines as a  stop-gap  measure while it decides how to handle tallies for future elections. But the machines will remain the primary recording mechanism for this election. despite the hand counting. If it s successful. and we can show that we can be effective and we learn by it. we can go to a full hand-count process.  Kampf told reporters.The Republican s nominee for secretary of state.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) is not on the ballot this November. but that hasn t stopped her from playing a central role in Arizona s marquee Senate and gubernatorial races.Sinema has strongly backed Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly s bid for reelection. even as Republicans have repeatedly used her as a foil to challenge Kelly s qualifications as a moderate and a lawmaker independent of national Democrats. On the other hand. she had stayed relatively silent on state Secretary of State Katie Hobbs  run for governor. even as Hobbs. a Democrat. trails Republican Kari Lake. a far-right former news anchor with a specialty in election denial.But in a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday. Sinema indicated for the first time that she supports Hobbs. Arizonans vote for the candidate they believe best represents Arizona values. and that s why I voted for Katie Hobbs for Governor.  Sinema said.Sinema s role in the two races shows how her relationship with the state s Democratic Party remains rocky at best after her refusal to budge on eliminating the filibuster. which contributed to the sinking of much of President Joe Biden s initial agenda. And the outcomes of both contests could help shape how voters view Sinema s own reelection bid in 2024. when she is likely to face a serious primary challenge. If Mark wins. that s probably bad for Sinema s future in the Democratic Party.  said one Democratic strategist in the state. requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly.  And if Mark loses. there will be a freakout that shores up her standing. Sinema has donated $10.000 to Kelly s campaign and $60.000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She s also hosted a fundraiser for Kelly and sent out multiple fundraising messages to her own extensive email list. providing a further boost to Kelly s already high-powered fundraising efforts. Over the past two years. Mark has been a great partner in our work securing the border. strengthening Arizona s water future. and lowering prices for everyday Arizona families.  Sinema told The Arizona Republic last week. ticking off three issues where she and Kelly have both tried to separate themselves from the national Democratic Party brand.  I was proud to support his campaign in 2020 and I m laser focused on keeping him in the Senate. Her messaging echoes Kelly s own. For instance. his campaign released an ad on Tuesday featuring a rancher who lives on the Arizona-Mexico border praising Kelly s independence. I don t agree with him on every issue.  the rancher. identified as Bill. says in the 30-second ad.  But he listens to people. Listening to GOP television ads and attacks from Blake Masters. the venture capitalist who won the Republican Senate nomination with the backing of former President Donald Trump. you might get the impression Kelly and Sinema are adversaries rather than allies. We were wondering which way Manchin. which way Sinema was going to vote.  Masters said at a campaign event in August. shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.  You never have to ask which way Mark Kelly is going to vote. You know the answer. He s going to vote with Chuck Schumer. Masters deployed a similar line during the only debate between him and Kelly. arguing that he could work with  moderate  senators like Sinema.A recent ad from Our American Century. a conservative super PAC primarily funded by casino magnate Steve Wynn. opens with a similar slight. The ad. which pretends to be supportive of Kelly but actually highlights the senator s unpopular purported progressive stances. features a shot of Sinema when the narrator declares:  Other Democrats may abandon Biden. but the president doesn t worry about Kelly. Earlier in the 2022 cycle. One Nation ― a conservative nonprofit controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― released multiple ads praising Sinema for her support of the filibuster. and knocking Kelly for not echoing her stance. At times. Sinema and Kelly have seemed attached at the hip. Shortly after he was sworn in. Kelly joined Sinema in breaking with other Democratic senators to support a massive arms sale to the United Arab Emirates sought by the Trump administration. He also worked with her and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to kill the nomination of a progressive to a key Labor Department post. and the two helped negotiate a bipartisan gun safety law this summer. Kelly and Sinema have nearly identical voting records. both voting with Biden 94.5% of the time. according to FiveThirtyEight s vote tracker. (Only five Senate Democrats voted with Biden less.)At the same time. Kelly has broken with Sinema on several key issues. including filibuster reform and raising the minimum wage to $15.And occasionally. Kelly has seemed bemused by Sinema s maneuvering. When Sinema was holding up the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act this summer over a provision to tighten the so-called carried interest loophole. which primarily benefits private equity partners. a HuffPost reporter asked Kelly if it was an important issue for his constituents.  I hear a lot about prescription drugs.  Kelly responded. referring to a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act to allow Medicare to use its buying power to negotiate drug costs.Despite their similar voting records. Kelly is far more popular than Sinema among the party faithful because of his  bedside manner.  as the Democratic strategist put it.  He s willing to have a dialogue with progressives.  Alex Alvarez. the executive director of Progress Arizona. said of Kelly.  He s been able to build a relationship with the progressive community in Arizona. That doesn t mean we ve always agreed with him. Mike Noble. the managing partner of OH Predictive Insights. which does regular polling of Arizona. said the focus on Sinema from the news media and the left has almost certainly helped Kelly. In this very polarized environment. people haven t been going after his voting record as much. and when you look at that voting record. it probably does not look very independent.  Noble said.  He s done a great job of not losing his base ― Sinema s base is gone ― but among independents. he has pretty decent favorability. If Sinema s support for Kelly is unequivocal. the situation with Hobbs. the Democratic nominee for governor. is trickier. Hobbs first entered politics as a volunteer for Sinema s state legislative races. The two women. both social workers. quickly became friends and occasional running buddies. When Sinema ran for state senate. she encouraged Hobbs to run for the seat she was vacating. Hobbs also moved up into Sinema s state senate seat when the latter ran for Congress. But the relationship between the two women today seems frostier.In June 2021. Hobbs wrote a Washington Post op-ed calling out Sinema and Manchin s opposition to the filibuster. arguing that its elimination was necessary to pass legislation that would protect voting rights in Arizona and other states. Sinema and I serve the same state. We both know that if we do nothing now. Arizonans  access to the ballot will be stripped away by Republican legislators.  Hobbs wrote at the time.  If Republicans want to make the right to vote a partisan issue. that s their problem. I know — and I believe that U.S. senators know. too — that access to the ballot isn t a red or blue policy but a basic American value. Sinema s relatively late endorsement of Hobbs ― the election is less than two weeks away. and mail ballots went out in Arizona on Oct. 12 ― mirrors her occasional lack of engagement in statewide races. She never endorsed David Garcia. a progressive who won the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018 and lost by a wide margin to GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. And she did not back Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick s run against then-incumbent Sen. John McCain in 2016. In an interview in August. Hobbs said she had not talked to Sinema about her campaign. We haven t spoken about it.  she said.  I m just really focused on running the campaign I need to run. But I would welcome anyone s support that would help us build the coalition we need to win this race. In a statement this week. Hobbs  campaign said she is excited to work with her fellow Democrats.  Katie will continue to work with Senators Kelly and Sinema after she wins to combat the rampant inflation in our state. solve Arizona s ongoing water crisis. and secure our border once and for all.  a spokesperson said.An AARP survey from September. conducted by a bipartisan duo of pollsters. tested the popularity of all three Democrats. Fifty percent of likely voters in the state had a favorable view of Kelly. while 46% had an unfavorable view. Hobbs was slightly less well-known. with 46% holding a favorable view and 42% holding a negative one. Sinema was the least popular of the trio: Thirty-seven percent had a favorable view of her. and 54% had an unfavorable view.But the partisan makeup of Kelly and Hobbs  coalitions was sharply different than Sinema s. Kelly boasted a 92% favorable rating among Democrats. a 48% favorable rating among independents and just 14% favorability among Republicans. Sinema. meanwhile. was essentially equal among all three groups: Thirty-seven percent of Democrats. 41% of independents and 36% of Republicans held a favorable view of her. Since the AARP s survey field date in September. the GOP has gained in both Arizona races. Public surveys still show Kelly with a small lead over Masters. but Biden remains deeply unpopular and a motley crew of GOP groups are funding ads backing Masters. Lake. meanwhile. has charged into a slight lead over Hobbs.The reasons for Hobbs  struggles are manifold. Lake. formerly a longtime TV anchor in Phoenix. has a celebrity that the relatively low-key Hobbs. who has served just a single term in statewide office. could not possibly replicate. Hobbs  decision not to debate Lake has been a weekslong story. likely throwing her campaign off-track far more than a weak performance would have.The possibility of a split decision in the major statewide races ― a Kelly victory paired with a Hobbs loss ― could potentially reinforce Sinema s arguments about how Democrats need to nominate centrist candidates with appeal to independents and Republicans to win in Arizona. While Hobbs is not generally considered a movement progressive. she has not strained to separate herself from the national brand the way Kelly and Sinema have. For instance. Hobbs backtracked on her initial support for the Biden administration s decision to end Title 42. which allowed the government to expel migrants faster during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Kelly and Sinema opposed the administration from the beginning. (A judge blocked the administration s move. and Title 42 remains in effect.)However. anger at Sinema among the Democratic base may simply be too great for any electoral arguments to preempt a primary challenge. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) has mused publicly about challenging Sinema. and way-too-early polling shows a primary electorate willing or even eager to toss Sinema aside. There s enough interest from really credible candidates on the ground that it s going to happen.  Alvarez. of Progress Arizona. said.  Everybody s just looking for the best option here.  ,Politics News
PHOENIX — Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake don t agree on much. but their campaigns for Arizona governor did have one thing in common recently — the faint scent of manure.In Lake s case. it wafted through the breeze at a western ranch where the GOP nominee was holding a rally featuring a live rodeo and a petting zoo with llamas. alpacas and goats.

Every election year. there s hyperbole. that s just the nature of politics. But to us. it doesn t seem like hyperbole anymore. How do you combat it when there s no accountability. no objective facts? How do you do that? You can t. armed vigilantes patrolling dropboxesFinchemtapped to join This race is critical. I know you all know that.  Hobbs said in El Mirage at the home of the supporters with chickens and peacocks.  In 2020. the foundation of our democracy faced the most serious challenge of our lifetime. There were false accusations of fraud about the election. questions about the systems in place and the leaders in charge of them. Those accusations and questions led to threats against election workers around the state. against me and my family. There were even armed protesters outside my house.  While the vibe was low-key and even a bit serious at Hobbs events. Lake s rally was an actual party. with beer. cigars. hot dogs. live music and a petting zoo.It s hard to say whether the several thousand people who showed up for Lake s hoedown reflect a larger base of support or just the hardcore MAGA base that turned out for Trump (who still lost Arizona two years ago by less than one percentage point despite holding bigger rallies than Biden). Judging by much of the campaign gear. it seemed to be both. She doesn t take any shit! She tells it straight. We ve been waiting for that.  said Betsy Walsh. a 65-year-old from Goodyear who echoed others in liking that Lake isn t a  career politician  — something that attracted many voters to Trump in 2016. Everything is just so messed up. We re going into another recession.  said Dawn Goetz. a 57-year-old small business owner from El Mirage who. when prompted. said that Lake and Trump would make a good presidential ticket.  Kari Lake is all for us. She loves America and she loves Arizona. Lake didn t address the crowd for more than three hours after doors opened at Western Trails Ranch. where a giant inflatable red MAGA hat greeted people at the parking lot entrance.the change of heart she experienced as a journalist [Hobbs] voted against legislation that would provide life-saving care to a baby that survives an abortion. She would rather that baby die on a cold metal tray. She s sick. she s a monster.  Lake said. referring to a 2017 anti-abortion law that all but one Democrat in the state legislature voted against. And I ll tell you what. she loves Anthony Fauci ... she wants to force our children to get a vaccine of experimental shots in order to get an education. I ll tell you what. when I m your governor. we will not make our kids guinea pigs. We will not force them to get that shot.  she said to a round of applause. The vast majority of scientific research on vaccines shows they are safe for children.Lake kept touting her plans for  common-sense  solutions to Arizona s homelessness and border crises. and her desire for Arizona not to become like its liberal neighbor. California. which she painted as a dystopian haven for drugs and lawlessness under Biden s Democratic rule.  Under President Donald J. Trump ... life was so good. even the leftists have to admit it.  she said.It s not all rosy for Lake. who is widely considered too extreme for Arizona moderates and independents. Chuck Coughlin. a GOP consultant whose firm conducts statewide polling. suspects a large number of undecided voters will break for Democrats. I just don t know — if you re not a Lake voter at the outset. how do you become one?  Coughlin said.  Because you know she s there. You cannot miss the freight train running by your door. There s no narrative that s like. come on over. I m really OK. That seemed to bear out in a conversation with Rosemarie Mike. a self-described independent who attended a Mark Kelly event in Mesa to ask him questions that would help her decide whether to vote for him. Kelly. a Democrat. pitched himself as a centrist. praising both GOP Gov. Doug Ducey and the late Republican Sen. John McCain. whom he succeeded.  Kari Lake and Blake Masters have similar beliefs that I feel are dangerous.  Kelly said.In the governor s race. Mike is leaning toward Hobbs. I still want to see a little more of [Hobbs]. because I don t see a lot of her.  Mike said. waiting for Kelly to show up at a parking lot in a municipal government center where a truck was offering free ice cream on behalf of the campaign.  I think she s too radical. I don t see her as a uniter. ,Politics News

With midterm elections less than two weeks away and voters worried about spiraling costs. President Joe Biden will hit the road Thursday to warn that if Republicans win control of Congress. inflation will get worse. The White House said Wednesday that Republican plans to extend the temporary tax cuts they enacted in 2017 would put upward pressure on prices. and so would their plans to reverse recent Democratic legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate for cheaper prescription drugs. Administration officials repeatedly described the Republican agenda as  mega MAGA trickle-down economics  during a conference call. echoing a phrase Biden used last week at a Democratic National Committee event.  Republicans are doubling down on their mega MAGA trickle-down economics that benefits the very wealthy.  Biden said Monday.  It failed their country before and will fail it again if they win.  Democrats had hoped that the Supreme Court decision ending federal abortion rights would help them escape the electoral beating that a president s party usually takes in midterm elections. Abortion gave Democrats a boost this summer. but polls still give Republicans strong odds of taking the House and maybe the Senate. with inflation the No. 1 issue in essentially every public and private political survey. Stanley Greenberg. a veteran Democratic pollster. released a memo on Tuesday arguing that Democrats need to focus almost exclusively on cost-of-living issues in the final days of the election. While he argues there is little the party can do to blunt Republican attacks on immigration or crime issues. they can still gain ground on economic issues. DemocratsGreenberg s key advice for Democrats is to acknowledge that many Americans are struggling and to emphasize that Democrats took on entrenched interest groups Republicans are still beholden to. Here s what he recommends as the party s closing argument: Working people haven t seen a real pay increase in years. And Washington doesn t get it. The special interests call the shots. But finally. Democrats raised taxes on the big corporations and lowered costs for working families by cutting their taxes. reducing health care. prescription drug. and energy costs. and went after price gouging. Republicans get their money from big oil and big pharmaceutical special interests. Republicans don t get it. He also warned Democrats not to try an all-of-the-above approach. saying that mentioning abortion rights. Republican extremism or attempting to sell Biden s accomplishments only weakens the Democratic message.  Our cost of living message (and recognizing no pay raise) is the only message that marginally grows the vote against this onslaught.  Greenberg said.  The message currently being used by the White House and many national Democrats loses the vote further. A new ad from Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. Democratic Party s nominee in a Senate race against Republican incumbent Ron Johnson. hits many of Greenberg s recommended notes.  I see your hard work. everything you do to try to make it.  Barnes says in the ad over footage of him meeting with regular Wisconsinites at their workplaces.  But people continue to be left behind. I m running for Senate to put more money in your pocket. Ron Johnson s had 12 years to make things better. But costs are still rising. and all he s managed to do is write a tax cut for himself. Biden will travel to Syracuse. New York. on Thursday to reprise his  mega MAGA trickledown  speech at the site of a forthcoming computer chip factory. On Monday. he described  mega MAGA trickledown  as his closing argument before next month s election. It s essentially a Trump-themed recapitulation of the classic Democratic pitch that the party supports working people while Republicans support the rich.  We. the Democrats. are the ones that are fiscally responsible.  Biden said.  Let s get that straight now. OK? We re investing in all of America. reducing everyday costs while also lowering the deficit at the same time. Republicans are fiscally reckless. pushing tax cuts for the very wealthy that aren t paid for. and [exploding] the deficit that is making inflation worse.  Undoing the corporate tax increases Democrats signed into law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act would likely have a marginal impact on inflation. The 2017 tax cuts for individuals are not set to expire until 2025. administration officials declined to say whether Biden supported letting all or just some of them lapse at that time. The biggest decider of inflation s course over the next two years will likely be the Federal Reserve. not Congress. The central bank has been jacking up interest rates in an effort to slow inflation by slowing down the entire economy. a strategy supported by most lawmakers in both parties. The biggest question is how bad the economy will get as a result.But Biden did zero in on a high-stakes fiscal policy showdown that Republicans have called for next year over the debt ceiling. Republicans have said they would withhold support from legislation allowing the federal government to borrow money in order to pay bills Congress has incurred over the years. potentially triggering an unprecedented debt default and economic crisis. Some Republicans have suggested they ll hold the debt ceiling hostage in exchange for cuts to Social Security and Medicare benefits for seniors.  They ve stated boldly that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare. to the point that they ll shut down the government. they say. and send the nation into default. which raises prices for everyone. if we do not cut Social Security and Medicare.  Biden said.  I ain t gonna do it.  ,Politics News
new rulesa major policy shiftsecretly sought email recordsCNNThe formal adoption of the new regulations represents a major policy shift for the Justice Department and will limit the agency s ability to pursue investigations into leaks from within the government. These regulations recognize the crucial role that a free and independent press plays in our democracy.  Garland said in a statement Wednesday.  Because freedom of the press requires that members of the news media have the freedom to investigate and report the news. the new regulations are intended to provide enhanced protection to members of the news media from certain law enforcement tools and actions that might unreasonably impair newsgathering. simply wrongThe change was hailed by free press advocates.

Donald TrumpMitch McConnellThe former president s Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC has. through Wednesday. reported a total of $8.5 million spent for Republican Senate candidates — barely 4% of the $204.5 million that McConnell s Senate Leadership Fund has spent. according to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.If Trump s PAC continues spending at the rate it did for the first half of October. and even if all that money comes from his Save America  leadership  PAC rather than outside benefactors. Trump would still be left with more than $80 million available for his own personal or political use after the midterms.they toutedRepublicansTrump has spent $1.2 million attacking Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.). $1.6 million opposing Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and $1.1 million going after Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). He has also spent $1.6 million and $2.3 million attacking John Fetterman and Tim Ryan. the Democratic Senate nominees in Pennsylvania and Ohio. respectively. and another $706.000 boosting Blake Masters. the GOP nominee in Arizona.Indeed. in all five races. the Republican nominee is Trump s choice. based almost entirely on a willingness to spread Trump s lies that the 2020 election had been  stolen  from him through voter fraud. In each of those five states. Republicans may have had a stronger chance of winning had a more mainstream candidate wound up as the nominee.Yet even in most of those states. McConnell s PAC has vastly outspent Trump s. In Georgia. for example. the Senate Leadership Fund has already spent $33 million attacking Warnock. It has spent $29 million attacking Ryan in Ohio. $22 million on Cortez Masto in Nevada. and $42 million on Fetterman in Pennsylvania.Only in Arizona — where McConnell had been hoping to persuade termed-out Gov. Doug Ducey to run against Kelly. only to have Trump chase him off for failing to help him steal the election there — has the Senate Leadership Fund not played a role.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) must turn over records connected with migrant flights from Texas to Massachusetts. a Florida judge ruled Tuesday. saying his administration failed to comply with the state s public records law. The governor s office says it intends to appeal. claiming that DeSantis provided  a significant number  of documents despite being preoccupied with Hurricane Ian at the time. This month. the open government group Florida Center for Government Accountability. or FLCGA. filed a lawsuit seeking to compel DeSantis to release public records related to two charter flights he ordered that took 48 migrants. many of them Venezuelan. from San Antonio. Texas. to Martha s Vineyard. Massachusetts.A judge in Leon County. Florida. J. Lee Marsh. ruled against the governor and ordered his office to turn over public records that FLCGA requested within 20 days. These records include phone and text logs of James Uthmeier. the governor s chief of staff. who helped transport migrants to Martha s Vineyard.The governor s office did not show  any steps. direct steps taken to gather what this court finds are public records.  Marsh said. We disagree with the court s ruling and intend to appeal.  DeSantis  office told HuffPost.  This records request came amid a historically devastating hurricane and the Executive Office of the Governor was focused on supporting the needs and recovery of Floridians from Hurricane Ian. Regardless. we have already produced a significant number of documents and. as we have already stated. continue to endeavor to do so in a timely manner.  DeSantis is also facing lawsuits from migrants who were left stranded after being flown to the Massachusetts island. A Texas sheriff is also investigating whether the migrants. who were given false promises of work and shelter before they were flown to Massachusetts as a political stunt. were defrauded.Another investigation. launched in October by the Treasury Department s inspector general. is investigating whether DeSantis  improperly used  money from COVID-19 aid to pay for the flights.,Politics News
A small but growing number of Democrats worry the Federal Reserve could cause too much collateral damage in its quest to control inflation.In a letter to Fed chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) urged him to remember that Congress tasked the central bank with maintaining both stable prices and full employment. The Fed s actions could cause massive layoffs. the senator warned. For working Americans who already feel the crush of inflation. job losses will make it much worse.  Brown wrote.  We can t risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans who can t afford it. The letter represented Brown s strongest warning this year about the consequences of the Fed s interest rate increases. which are supposed to slow price growth by slowing down the entire economy ― a process that could cause a recession if the Fed pushes too hard. Democrats and Republicans alike mostly support Powell s efforts. which have included the sharpest interest rate hikes in decades alongside selling off bonds the Fed purchased in order to protect the economy during the pandemic. After the sharp partisan split over spending last year. the bipartisan consensus on the Fed has been remarkable. But more Democrats are showing signs of Fed skepticism. said Rakeen Mabud. chief economist at Groundwork Collaborative. a progressive think tank that has been warning about the dangers of tight monetary policy all year.  We re seeing more and more lawmakers raising the alarm that the Fed is going down the wrong path. putting the incredible recovery that we ve seen thus far in jeopardy.  Mabud said. citing several comments from lawmakers since June.  The Fed risks throwing our economy into a massive recession.  Mabud said.  That s essentially what Powell has committed to doing. He s hacking away at the one leg of the stool that s holding up our economy. which is a strong labor market. suggested he thinksSens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have led their colleagues in criticizing the central bank. Sanders said this month that the Fed is  hurting the situation  and that corporate greed is the real problem. Warren has been more strident.  The Fed has no control over the main drivers of rising prices. but the Fed can slow demand by getting a lot of people fired and making families poorer.  Warren said at a hearing in June. Interest rate hikes squeeze the economy by making money costlier to borrow. slowing spending and eventually resulting in slower price increases as demand falls into balance with supply. Powell has acknowledged that the Fed can t affect the supply problems contributing to inflation and that slashing demand will involve some  pain  for everyday people.So far. the rate hikes have slowed down the housing market. which is heavily dependent on borrowing. but have not had an obvious effect on the broader economy. The latest data show inflation as high as ever and unemployment still at a very low 3.5%. Powell and his colleagues are set to announce another rate hike next week. as well as fresh projections of the likely economic effect. In September. they estimated rate hikes would push the unemployment rate to 4.4% next year. which would likely amount to a recession. The September estimate was half a percentage point higher than the July estimate because of how little the rate hikes over the summer slowed inflation.Several Democrats expressed concerns about the risks of rate hikes in a Politico article earlier this month. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said it s  important that they not choke off the job recovery.  and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said higher interest rates aren t  all that effective for some of the most significant inflationary pressures that we re facing.  But they and other Democrats still said they thought Powell was doing a good job. Back in June. Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) voiced concerns as well.  When you raise interest rates it has a major negative impact. certainly on affordable housing.  Cardin told The Hill. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). meanwhile. told CNN at the beginning of October that the Fed had been too slow to confront inflation and that it s now being too aggressive.  The Fed hasn t gotten the blame they deserve.  Khanna said. ,Politics News

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan on Tuesday. asking that the regulator oppose the merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons.The progressive politicians argued that the proposed $25 billion deal would lead to higher prices and lower wages. hurting shoppers and workers alike. Kroger and Albertsons are two of the largest grocery chains in the country. Kroger s and Albertsons  histories of aggressive profiteering during the pandemic present a dangerous roadmap for how a larger and more powerful company would act if this acquisition were allowed to proceed.  Warren and Sanders wrote.The lawmakers went on to call both companies  anticompetitive and antiworker.  The FTC should. when evaluating the impact of a potential merger. examine Kroger s and Albertsons  records of raking in profits and providing massive payouts for executives and big shareholders while putting their frontline employees at risk.  they wrote.Warren and Sanders were joined on the letter by Rep. Jan Schakowsky. an Illinois Democrat. (Read the full letter below.)Kroger and Albertsons have a combined 5.000 stores and 710.000 workers in the U.S.. with dozens of chains between them. such as Fred Meyer and Ralphs (Kroger) and Safeway and Jewel-Osco (Albertsons). Workers at many stores under both companies are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union. At least four affiliates of that union have come out against the merger. saying they have concerns about store closures and layoffs. One Kroger worker recently told Reuters:  I wish they would put their money toward trying to lower prices and increase wages. rather than gobbling up the competition.  The boards of both companies unanimously approved the proposed deal. saying it would help them compete with large rivals like Walmart and Amazon. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen argued in a joint statement with Albertsons that together they would  build a more equitable and sustainable food system.  He also noted the deal would  generate greater returns for our shareholders. In their letter. Warren and Sanders pointed to a survey of 10.000 Kroger workers conducted by the nonprofit Economic Roundtable last year at the request of the UFCW. The authors found that  the living and working conditions of Kroger workers have declined markedly over the past 20 years.  leaving more than three-quarters of the company s workforce food-insecure. These workers cannot afford balanced and healthy food.  the report s authors wrote.  They run out of food before the end of the month. skip meals. and are hungry sometimes.

WELLINGTON. New Zealand (AP) — For the first time in New Zealand s history. a majority of lawmakers are women.Soraya Peke-Mason from the liberal Labour Party was sworn into Parliament on Tuesday. replacing former Speaker Trevor Mallard. who left to become ambassador to Ireland. With the resignation of another male lawmaker. it has tipped the balance in Parliament to 60 women and 59 men. Whilst it s a special day for me. I think it s historic for New Zealand.  Peke-Mason told reporters.The milestone places New Zealand among a half-dozen nations in the world that this year can claim at least 50% female representation in their parliaments. according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Other nations include Cuba. Mexico. Nicaragua. Rwanda and the United Arab Emirates.Globally. about 26% of lawmakers are women. according to the union.New Zealand has a history of strong female representation. In 1893. it became the first nation to allow women to vote. Current Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is the nation s third female leader. and women currently also hold a number of other top roles including chief justice of New Zealand s Supreme Court and governor-general. I m just really pleased that my daughters are growing up in a country where women being equally represented in public life is just normal.  said Nicola Willis. the deputy leader of the conservative National Party.Marama Davidson. co-leader of the liberal Green Party. was more blunt. About blimmin  time.  she told reporters.Ardern cautioned that the situation for women in many other countries was precarious. As we step forward. it feels as if we watch so many women experiencing a rapid slide backwards in progress.  she said.And reaching gender parity could prove only transitory. Opinion polls indicate that New Zealand s conservative parties. which currently have a lower proportion of women than their liberal rivals. are poised to make gains during next year s general election.,Politics News

There should not be involvement from the federal government in how states decide their abortion decisions.  Oz said Tuesday.  As a physician. I ve been in the room when there s some difficult conversations happening. I don t want the federal government involved with that at all. He added:  I want women. doctors. local political leaders. letting the democracy that s always allowed our nation to thrive. putting the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves.

I would vote against.  Oz said.  What I feel strongly about is that women in Pennsylvania understand what I m saying. Fetterman. who has regularly lambasted Oz for his stance on abortion rights. said he believed the procedure was a  universal right for all women in America.  I believe abortion is health care. and I believe that is a choice that belongs with each woman and her doctor.  he said at Tuesday s debate.,Politics News
In a cycle when many candidates are refusing to debate their opponents. Democrat John Fetterman took the stage Tuesday night for the first. and only. debate in the hotly contested U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania. Fetterman. the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. did so despite still struggling to recover his communication skills following a nearly fatal stroke in May. He has openly talked about his difficulty finding his words and accurately interpreting spoken conversation. In a memo to reporters on Monday. Fetterman s team set expectations low ahead of the debate. noting that Fetterman s  ongoing auditory processing challenges are real. Those struggles were apparent in Tuesday night s debate while his Republican opponent. Mehmet Oz. showed his ease on TV. the medium that made him famous around America as  Dr. Oz.  From the outset. Oz. who did not live in Pennsylvania until he decided to run for Senate. set the tone. pitching himself as a moderate who can bring  balance  back to Washington.Asked by the moderators from Harrisburg ABC affiliate WHTM whether he d support Donald Trump if he ran for president again. Oz quickly replied that he would support the Republican nominee before pivoting to a celebration of bipartisanship. I have reached out across the aisle on my campaign because I want to bring balance to Washington.  he said.  And I ve tried to work with Democrats and Republicans and people in the middle. people who are unsure … people who got angry with where their party was headed. He also sold himself as an agent of change for any voter dissatisfied with President Joe Biden. unified Democratic control in Congress and the state of the economy. Are you unhappy with where America is headed?  he said.  I am. and if you are as well. then I m the candidate for change. Fetterman has been open about his auditory processing issues since returning to the campaign trail in August after three months recovering from the stroke. Fetterman s physician has said that he is fit to run and  work full duty.  but he still confuses words while speaking. and his brain can have trouble understanding spoken words. especially in noisy environments.At Fetterman s behest. he and Oz were able to use closed-captioning monitors above the debate moderators to ensure he understood every question. It s a practice he has already adopted for sit-down interviews with journalists.Fetterman was at his best reciting lines that he had clearly rehearsed. I m running to serve Pennsylvania.  he declared in his opening statement.  He s running to use Pennsylvania. He laid out what he called the  Oz rule  early on: that if Oz is speaking on television. he s lying. Fetterman deployed the line to rebut allegations that he wants to adopt  socialized medicine  and that he does not support fracking. a controversial method of extracting natural gas.In fact. Fetterman has supported  Medicare for All.  which would require all Americans to enroll in a health insurance plan run by the federal government.supportFetterman also had a clever retort when Oz tried to make him answer for endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president in 2016. Why don t you pretend that you live in Vermont instead of Pennsylvania and run against Bernie Sanders?  Fetterman said.  Because all you can do is talk about Bernie Sanders. But at other critical moments in the debate. Fetterman struggled to keep up with Oz.In his opening statement. Oz managed to squeeze in a critique of Fetterman s support for granting clemency to a greater number of convicted criminals as chair of the state s board of pardons.  John Fetterman. during this crime wave. has been trying to get as many murderers convicted and sentenced to life in prison out of jail as possible.  Oz said. I want Washington to be civil again.  he added.  We need it to be less radical. late old ageHe did not get the chance to respond to Oz s charges until later in the debate. however. when he touted his record addressing crime as mayor of Braddock. Working with the police and working with our community. I was able to stop gun violence for 5½ years as mayor.  he said.Energy policy was another area where Fetterman faltered. Pressed to explain why he had initially criticized fracking before embracing it. Fetterman did not offer an explanation.  I do support fracking.  he said.  And I don t. I don t. I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking. has previously clarified2014 columnBut Republicans boast close ties to the oil and gas industry. perhaps making Oz s denial that he had ever had a change of heart seem more plausible.  I ve been very consistent  in support of fracking. he said.Oz even turned his non-response to a question about whether he supports raising Pennsylvania s minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 to an ode on the wonders of Pennsylvania s natural gas.Claiming that the labor market had already driven wages higher than $15 an hour. Oz declared.  If we can unleash the energy beneath our feet here in Pennsylvania. there d be plenty of money to go around. Indeed. some of Oz s strength on Tuesday night was due to the ease with which he evaded questions about the issues.Asked whether he would have voted for the bipartisan gun control legislation supported by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Oz declined to respond. I would have tried to improve that bill. There are things that I think most of us appreciate.  he said.  I wasn t there at the time. so I can t speak to what was possible.  But in other cases. he got the chance to clarify his views for a statewide audience for the first time.deep spending cutsOz also said that he would oppose any federal restrictions on abortion rights.  I ve been very clear on my desire as a physician not to interfere with how states decide  abortion laws. Oz said.That would seem to preclude Oz supporting GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham s bill banning the procedure after 15 weeks nationwide. though three times Oz avoided saying specifically whether he would vote for or against that bill. For his part. Fetterman tried to bring the conversation back to the stark contrast between how he and Oz responded to the Supreme Court s June decision to overturn a constitutional right to abortion. I support on Roe v. Wade. That was the law of the land for 50 years.  Fetterman said.  He celebrated when it fell down. and I would fight to reestablish on Roe v. Wade.  If you believe that the choice of your reproductive freedom belongs with Dr. Oz. then you have a choice.  he added.  But if you believe that the choice for abortion belongs to you and your doctor. that s what I fight for. Oz also inadvertently gave Fetterman ammunition to attack when describing his support for setting abortion policy at the state level. I want women. doctors. local political leaders. letting the democracy that s always allowed our nation to thrive. to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves.  Oz said. local political leaders Fetterman announced plans to debut a TV campaign ad that would include the  political leaders  snippet on Wednesday. Our campaign will be putting money behind making sure as many women as possible hear Dr. Oz s radical belief that ‘local political leaders  should have as much say over a woman s abortion decisions as women themselves and their doctors.

President Joe Biden received the updated COVID-19 vaccine live on television Tuesday. urging Americans to protect themselves against the virus ahead of the anticipated winter surge but stopping short of encouraging mask-wearing.Biden received the latest vaccine targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the omicron strain. the current versions of COVID-19 that are most prevalent in the country and globally. Public health officials in the U.S. recommend people over the age of 5 get the updated vaccine once a year —  with the exception that the elderly and immunocompromised may need more than one shot annually. Get vaccinated. Update your COVID vaccine. It s incredibly effective. but the truth is not enough people are getting it. We ve got to change that so we can all have a safe and healthy holiday season.  the president said in a speech.  That s why I m getting my shot updated today. The bivalent COVID-19 boosters became available on Sept. 2. and people can find a location to get vaccinated on vaccines.gov. The vaccine helps those who can get it have the best protection against serious illness and death from the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the omicron subvariants. Biden said that people who refuse to get vaccinated even though they can are putting themselves and others at risk. especially right before the season that historically has more flu and COVID-19 cases. New variants have emerged here in the U.S. and around the world. We ve seen cases of hospitalizations rise in Europe in recent weeks. and the weather is getting colder. People will spend more time indoors and contagious viruses like COVID are going to spread considerably more easily.  the president said.  As a country. we have a choice to make.  he continued.  Can we repeat what happened in the past winters? More infections. more hospitalizations. more loved ones getting sick. even dying from the virus? Or can we have a much better winter. if we use all the tools we have available to us now? While the vaccine protects against hospitalization and death. people can still contract the virus — especially if they do not implement other mitigating measures like wearing a mask indoors and in crowds. and avoiding close contact with those who are infected or exposed. Biden encouraged people who are symptomatic or feel they ve been exposed to get tested for COVID-19. and to receive treatment if they test positive.Notably. the president did not once mention in his speech the idea of wearing masks ahead of the winter surge. Masks are important for preventing transmission. and can help disabled people safely move around in public knowing they are better protected from others. Over the course of this year. the country has lifted mask mandates in indoor public settings that would have allowed disabled people to participate in society.The vaccine also does not necessarily prevent long COVID. a major health problem resulting from infection that disables a person due to a list of long-lasting symptoms ranging from fatigue. brain fog. muscle and joint pain. and nerve issues. The president did not specifically mention long COVID in his speech. I want to speak directly to those with special conditions. No variants may make some existing protections effective for the immunocompromised.  Biden said Tuesday.  Sadly. this means you may be at a special risk. I urge you to consult with doctors on the right steps to protect yourself. Take extra precautions. When asked why Biden did not mention the significance of masks or long COVID. a White House spokesman said it is  undeniable  that updated vaccines are the best protection against the virus. When asked if the reason was due to worries about Republican reactions. the spokesman denied the notion. and has not yet answered HuffPost s additional question about whether Biden plans to do more for disabled and immunocompromised people who are feeling left to fend for themselves.COVID-19  deaths :are: preventable using a layered mitigation strategy (high quality. protective masks. tests. indoor air quality improvements. vaccines. sick leave policy that doesn t force sick folks to work. etc).  tweeted disability activist and Data for Progress fellow Matthew Cortland.  Yet. the [White House] continues this vaccine only strategy. ,Politics News

Biden promised. The two-time Olympic gold medalist. who was on her way to play with the Russian Premier League during the WNBA offseason. was first detained at a Russian airport in February after authorities found cartridges containing less than a gram of hashish oil in her luggage.Griner was detained amid high tensions between Russia and the U.S.. which has strongly opposed the Kremlin s invasion of Ukraine and sanctioned Russia for its actions there. Russia took Griner into custody one week before launching its invasion of Ukraine.The Biden administration has faced immense pressure to bring home Griner. whose supporters say she is being used as a political pawn amid Russia s diplomatic friction with the U.S. In July. Biden approved a potential prisoner exchange to bring the basketball star and other prisoners home. but negotiations fell through when Russia demanded that the trade include a convicted Russian assassin. Griner s wife. Cherelle Griner. said earlier this month she was hopeful a prisoner exchange would work out before Tuesday s hearing so her wife could avoid being sent to a labor camp.CBS Mornings,Politics News
The Florida Republican Party paid thousands of dollars over the summer to a far-right activist who attended the white nationalist  Unite the Right  rally in 2017 and later charged at a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators with a Confederate flag. Christopher Monzon was paid more than $10.000 by the party between June and September. federal campaign finance records show. Neither Monzon nor the Florida GOP responded to HuffPost s request for comment about the payments. Monzon was in the news Monday after Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted that  one of our canvassers  had been attacked in Hialeah — a conservative and predominantly Cuban-American city in Miami-Dade County —  by 4 animals who told him Republicans weren t allowed in their neighborhood.  Several prominent Republicans quickly latched onto the story. including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). who tweeted.  Violence has NO PLACE in politics.  A police report confirmed an attack had taken place. However. it listed only two perpetrators. one of whom was arrested. and did not mention any potential political motivation. A Hialeah Police Department spokesperson told Local 10 News. Miami s ABC affiliate. that there was  no indication  as of Monday afternoon that the attack was politically motivated.According to the police report. which cites the victim s statements. Javier Jesus Lopez. 25. slammed a man to the ground and punched him in the face after confronting him for passing out fliers in the neighborhood. An anti-fascist Twitter account. Miami Against Fascism. first said it had identified the alleged victim as Monzon. and the Miami New Times confirmed his identity a few hours later. Rubio s campaign subsequently told The Miami Herald that Monzon was canvassing for the Republican Party of Florida. not the senator s campaign.The New Times reported that it attempted to interview Monzon in the hospital with the approval of the hospital s media department. but that it was unable to do so because  former and current members of the Vice City Proud Boys were at the hospital and refused to grant entry to the room. Federal campaign finance recordsshow seven bimonthly payments of $1.483.34. labeled  payroll.  were made to Monzon between June 29 and Sept. 30. as were two other payments totaling $115.56 for  travel & meals - GOTV.  likely a reference to  get out the vote  efforts.The address listed for the five most recent payments matches the address Monzon used on local campaign finance filings when he unsuccessfully ran for Hialeah City Council in 2021.A video from the deadly 2017 rally in Charlottesville shows Monzon wearing a T-shirt for the white supremacist group League of the South.  I intend to stand for the South and die for it if need be.  Monzon says in a Southern drawl. In the video. he s wearing a helmet and holding a flag bearing both the Confederate stars and bars and the League of the South s black cross symbol.  They will not replace us.  Monzon says — a reference to the  great replacement theory.  the fascist and antisemitic belief that Jews are importing immigrants into Europe and North America in order to hasten the end of the white race.Monzon made his statement near a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee while standing among members of the Ku Klux Klan. the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement and the  alt-right  group Identity Evropa in what amounted to the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation.

A group of progressive lawmakers withdrew a high-profile letter intended to influence President Joe Biden s Ukraine policy on Tuesday. just a day after it was sent to the White House. The story behind the letter. which 30 House Democrats signed. is one of mismanagement by leadership. an alleged staff error and a failure to appreciate the sensitivities of discussing a brutal ongoing war. Multiple legislators were so surprised by the letter s release — and the ensuing criticism — that they publicly rejected the document and said it was supposed to be sent much earlier under different circumstances. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) ultimately agreed with them. In a statement Tuesday. she blamed her employees for releasing the letter and retracted it.  The letter was drafted several months ago but. unfortunately. was released by staff without vetting. As chair of the Caucus. I accept responsibility for this.  Jayapal said.  Every war ends with diplomacy. and this one will too. after Ukrainian victory. The letter sent yesterday. although restating that basic principle. has been conflated with GOP opposition to support for the Ukrainians  just defense of their national sovereignty. As such. it is a distraction at this time. and we withdraw the letter. told PoliticoThe timeline of the kerfuffle reflects how the left is still struggling to offer an effective message on foreign policy despite its years-long focus on reforming America s approach to global affairs and progressives  success in shaping some major national security debates. publishedThe letter faced immediate backlash online. as fellow legislators. analysts and liberal commentators accused the progressives of being naive at best. or worse. willing to reward Russian President Vladimir Putin for his vicious invasion of Ukraine. By Monday evening. Jayapal clarified. saying the letter did not propose a change in American support for Ukraine and the progressives did not seek to break with the Biden administration s policy.  We are united as Democrats.  Jayapal wrote.But her colleagues suggested otherwise. accused the progressiveswarnedto PoliticoBy Tuesday. letter signatories Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.). Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) had all posted tweets questioning the timing of the letter s release — with Jacobs saying she  wouldn t sign it today.  To understand how the progressive gambit imploded. HuffPost spoke with five sources familiar with the letter and Ukraine policy discussions among Democrats and reviewed a previous draft of the message. The overall picture: Thanks to a messy process and a misreading of the broader conversation about the war. a relatively anodyne statement became a firebomb that divided the caucus and could threaten leadership ambitions for Jayapal and other signatories.The timing of the letter s development and release was odd. Jayapal s team circulated the message to lawmakers in the summer when Russian forces seemed to have the upper hand in Ukraine.  We urge President Biden to seek a rapid end to the conflict as a chief priority. all while continuing to respect Ukraine s sovereign decisions.  read a pitch email seen by HuffPost. The message directed members of Congress and their staff to seek further information about the plan from Keane Bhatt. the policy director for the Congressional Progressive Caucus. (Bhatt declined to comment for this story.)tweetedaccording to Pocan It was supposed to go out Aug. 1. My guess is they just held it open trying to get as many people.  the aide told HuffPost.Come September. Jayapal s office was still trying to secure more signatures. with discussions continuing late into the month. according to a source. Jayapal s team kept the letter largely the same. according to HuffPost s review of the earlier and final drafts. only adding a condemnation of Russia s claim to annex Ukrainian territory. Several signatories said on Tuesday they weren t given a heads up on when the letter would be released. Jayapal s team did not appear to expect a backlash. the aide told HuffPost. saying that had they done so. they would likely have given signatories talking points to rebut potential attacks. We had no idea it came out until the maelstrom on Twitter.  the aide added.told CNNA striking element of the controversy is that most of the actual letter is not particularly striking. It promotes the U.S. s overall position that Ukraine deserves support. that Russia has behaved horrifically and that ending the war is vital to protect Ukrainians. prevent escalation and ease the global economic shock it has produced.Instead of highlighting that reality. some Democrats quickly accepted and echoed criticisms of the message. equating it to Republicans  growing skepticism towards Ukraine and sympathy for Putin s war narrative. saidTucker CarlsonCandace OwensThe progressives  message squarely blamed Putin for the war and subsequent human suffering and did not suggest ending U.S. aid to Ukraine. It also noted:  It is not America s place to pressure Ukraine s government regarding sovereign decisions. In withdrawing the letter on Tuesday. Jayapal said:  Because of the timing. our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy… The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats. who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of the military. strategic. and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people. are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces. Democrats could have tried to nip that perception in the bud — and upheld a clear progressive position on Ukraine. defying fringe activists who call the party pro-war and pundits who cast liberals as soft. The framing around the letter from The Washington Post and the subsequent discussion on Twitter frame the letter as progressives calling for appeasement and giving in to Putin and Russia. but if you actually read the letter. it doesn t do that.  the House Democratic aide argued.  People don t seem to think that you can hold both positions of arming Ukraine and supporting their sovereignty and pushing for a diplomatic offramp. Given the reflexively hawkish nature of Washington s national security discourse. progressives always face an uphill battle in championing diplomacy. This time. in making a major statement on the most significant issue in global politics. they were unprepared — and the setback has likely damaged their credibility and unity in a lasting way.CORRECTION: A prior version of this article misidentified Sen.

opened military combat jobs to womenended a ban on transgender people serving in the militaryCarter died after suffering a heart attack on Monday evening. according a statement Tuesday from Douglas Elmendorf. dean of Harvard University s Kennedy School. Carter had served as director of the school s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.Before Carter was named the Defense Department secretary. he served in President Barack Obama s administration as its top procurement officer and oversaw the department s effort to speed more than 24.000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan. At the time. thousands of U.S. troops were being maimed or killed by roadside bombs because there was not adequate protection in the vehicles they were operating. Carter frequently mentioned the rapid development and procurement of those vehicles as one of his proudest accomplishments. At peak production. the United States shipped over 1.000 MRAPs a month to theater. And there. they saved lives.  Carter said at a 2012 ceremony marking the completion of the vehicle production.  And you all know me. I would have driven one in here today. if I could get it through the door. In December 2015. after three years of study and debate. Carter ordered the military to open all jobs to women. removing the final barriers that kept women from serving in combat. including the most dangerous and grueling commando posts.The following year. Carter ended the ban on transgender troops serving in the U.S. military. saying it was the right thing to do. Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so.  Carter said in June 2016. laying out a one-year plan to implement the change.  Our mission is to defend this country. and we don t want barriers unrelated to a person s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier. sailor. airman. or Marine who can best accomplish the mission. Carter. a Philadelphia native. served as the 25th defense secretary and  loved nothing more than spending time with the troops. making frequent trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S. forces with his wife Stephanie.  his family said in a statement.  Carter always set politics aside. he served presidents of both parties over five administrations. ,Politics News

Republicansuptick in crimeDemocratsan advantage Crime in Pennsylvania is a real vulnerability for Democrats across the board.  said a national Republican strategist. who requested anonymity to speak freely.Josh Shapirobefeel Being safe  is Shapiro s shorthand for using law enforcement to reduce crime.  Feeling safe  is how he describes the complementary need for residents. especially Black residents. to have confidence that they will not suffer violence at the hands of the very police officers sworn to protect them. We re going to see police that are from the community. that are properly trained. that work hand in hand with our community groups to keep us safe. and that understand they ve got to get out of their patrol cars. walk the beat. learn the names of our children and talk to the people who really run the neighborhood.  he continued. eliciting cries of affirmation from the predominantly Black crowd.  You know who that is: The grandmas on their porches. They run the neighborhoods. and we ve got to make sure we build safe communities by working together.

Pennsylvania.  If he does win this race ― and I hope and pray that he does ― I do think personally that he has the kind of political skills and the governance skills to be president of the United States. As attorney general since 2017. Shapiro has earned a reputation as a tough-on-crime moderate. Catholic Church s cover-up of child sexual abusecriminal wage theft charges$20 millionShapiro s TV adsAt the same time. Shapiro is the kind of Democrat who is comfortable ticking off statistics that attest to his success fighting all kinds of lawbreakers. He takes credit for arresting more than 8.000 people for selling illegal drugs. 500 people for child trafficking and 400 people for gun trafficking. as well as seizing 3.2 billion doses of heroin and 4 million doses of fentanyl in his first term alone.In response to a Fox News reporter s question about how he would tackle crime. Shapiro emphasized his plan to hire 2.000 more police officers. We need more police in our communities. and we need to make sure that the police and the community are working closer together.  he responded to the reporter s question at a press briefing after an organized labor canvass kickoff in Media earlier on Oct. 8.supportingInstead. he offers support for broad  carrot -like incentives for better conduct without getting into too many specific details. He wants to encourage police departments to recruit more officers from the communities they patrol and improve police officers  training so they are better equipped to de-escalate situations that could result in the use of force. In the name of pursuing the improved training. he suggests he d expand the state s accreditation program for state troopers to local police departments. It s not just physical fitness and using a weapon effectively. which is incredibly important. but also making sure that we re talking to our law enforcement leaders and partners about mental health issues and also about the ways in which they engage with community ― doing so in a way that tries to mitigate violence and the risk of violence and instead wants to defuse different situations.  he told reporters at the Oct. 8 briefing.Chester Partnership for Safe NeighborhoodsOperation CeasefireUnder this strategy. the police department concentrates its resources on surveilling those men considered high risk and cracking down on any illicit activities. At the same time. community leaders backed by the government offer the young men help getting jobs. mentorships and access to social services such as mental health care ― should they choose to avail themselves of it. Stollsteimer credits Shapiro for providing critical support for the Chester Partnership through political leadership and legal expertise. and even prosecuting some cases when necessary. 60% drop The climate has changed tremendously.  according to Cory Long. a lifelong Chester resident and founder of an anti-violence nonprofit involved in the Chester Partnership for Safe Neighborhoods.  It s given us. as a community. a chance to somewhat heal and continue on the process of rebuilding and keeping our streets safe.  Shapiro s close cooperation with Stollsteimer and officials involved in the Chester Partnership for Safe Neighborhoods is something of a contrast with his relationship with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.

Republican Ron DeSantis refused to rule out a 2024 presidential run on Monday evening as he seeks a second term as Florida governor. declining to address challenges from Democratic nominee Charlie Crist to promise to serve out a full four years if reelected.Joe BidenThe exchange came during the sole debate between Crist and DeSantis in the general election campaign. barely two weeks before Election Day. as Crist attempted to use DeSantis  presumed interest in a White House bid and his full support for a new 15-week abortion ban to claw back into a race that appears to be moving in DeSantis  direction. He won t even tell you if he ll serve four years if you reelect him. I mean. come on. You deserve better than that.  Crist told the audience in the Fort Pierce auditorium and watching on television.Crist. who served as Florida s Republican governor from 2007 to 2011 but is now a Democrat. also hit DeSantis on the state s ongoing property insurance crisis. which is certain to become even worse following Hurricane Ian s trail of destruction across the state late last month. as well as his handling of COVID-19.Brown University analysis I would have listened to scientists. unlike the governor.

As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. it s Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney s (N.Y.) job to maximize the number of his fellow House Democrats who win their elections in November.But thanks to a Republican spending barrage. Maloney faces an increasingly difficult reelection battle of his own in a suburban seat that President Joe Biden carried by 10 percentage points in 2020.The Cook Political Report shifted its rating of Maloney s race against Republican state Assembly member Mike Lawler from  lean Democrat  to  toss-up  on Monday. If Maloney loses. he would be the first party campaign chair to lose reelection since 1992. according to Cook Political Report s Dave Wasserman. This race is and always has been competitive. just like the 5 others that Rep. Maloney has won.  Mia Ehrenberg. a Maloney campaign spokesperson. said in a statement responding to the rating change.  While MAGA Mike Lawler is alienating voters left and right with his anti-choice extremism and open use of racism and anti-Semitism. Rep. Maloney is campaigning on his strong record of results for the Hudson Valley. Maloney s campaign enjoys a significant direct fundraising advantage over Lawler. having spent $2.2 million on advertising to Lawler s $451.000. according to AdImpact. which monitors campaign advertising.But national Republican super PACs have spent lavishly to even the scales. The National Republican Congressional Committee. House Republicans  campaign arm. has spent nearly $500.000 in support of Lawler s bid.And the Congressional Leadership Fund. the House GOP super PAC that has dwarfed its Democratic counterpart in fundraising. has spent another $4.7 million.But the DCCC announced Monday afternoon that its independent expenditure program would put $605.000 behind a TV spot attacking  MAGA Mike  Lawler as an opponent of abortion rights who cozies up to right-wing extremists. (Lawler has claimed that he would leave abortion policy up to the states and that he opposes federal legislation restricting abortion rights.) Republicans are pouring well over $6 million to prop up MAGA Mike Lawler whose campaign couldn t compete on its own.  DCCC spokesperson Chris Taylor said in a statement.  Since day one. Chairman Maloney has been working tirelessly as a player coach — he s built a campaign and we ve built an operation at the DCCC that can support that reality. Democrats Sean Maloney s selfishness knows no bounds.  Lawler campaign spokesperson Bill O Reilly said in a statement.  Mr. Maloney is now robbing money from his fellow Democrats in a desperate attempt to save his own hide. The DCCC noted that it is spending more money in 41 other congressional seats than it is in New York s 17th Congressional District where Maloney is running. But House Republicans  ability to even force Democrats to spend in New York s 17th speaks to the size of their fundraising advantage. the momentum they enjoy in a year when they need to flip just five seats to retake the House. and the unique difficulties facing Democrats in New York where public discontent with an uptick in crime is fueling Republican candidates up and down the ballot. Lawler has likely benefited from the spirited campaign of Rep. Lee Zeldin (R) against New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D). Zeldin has gained ground against Hochul by blaming her for failing to repeal a 2019 law restricting the use of cash bail on the grounds that it penalizes low-income defendants awaiting trial. LawlerAsked at a candidate debate that year whether he believes in ending cash bail. Maloney responded.  Absolutely. and I d make it a top priority. attacking herseveral eventsSeptember poll The Cook ratings change should come as no surprise. as Mr. Maloney championed cashless bail. raised taxes on the middle class. and got caught partying in Europe this month while his constituents struggle to pay for heat and groceries.  O Reilly said in a statement.conclusively rejectedangered some colleaguesOther Democrats noted that the 17th was slightly more Democratic than the 18th. which Biden carried by just eight percentage points. In keeping with his role as DCCC chair. these critics charge. Maloney should have run in the harder seat.But Maloney. who currently represents only about one-quarter of the new 17th district. has noted that there are 16 House Democrats in seats that Biden carried by more in the DCCC s  Frontline  program for vulnerable incumbents. Referring to New York s 17th and 18th. Maloney told HuffPost in August.  You would have had two ‘Frontline  districts any way you slice it.  (New York s 17th does not technically have  Frontline  status since the DCCC chair s seat is not eligible for that designation.),Politics News
RENO. Nevada — Should Democrats make the 2022 elections about the threat to democracy? Or should they focus instead on other issues like abortion and the economy? It s a question of strategy that s been hotly debated this year.Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one Democrat who hasn t shied away from putting the 2020 election conspiracy and those who support the  big lie  front and center in her bid for a second term in office. The Nevada senator spent the majority of her remarks at an event with GOP supporters here on Friday recalling how election falsehoods led to the deadly Jan. 6. 2021. riot at the U.S. Capitol.  There should be consequences for people who undermine our democracy and peddle the big lie and conspiracy theories and who are only out for themselves on the backs of other people. including Nevadans. So it is time for us to get out and show who we are as a state and that we will not tolerate them.  Cortez Masto said on the opening weekend of early voting in the state.The ironic twist of fate for Cortez Masto is that she finds herself in serious danger of losing to an election denier who pushed vote fraud conspiracies on behalf of Donald Trump during the 2020 election. Adam Laxalt. the GOP Senate nominee and a former state attorney general. has repeatedly cast doubt on President Joe Biden s victory and has already suggested he might challenge the results of his own election race this year. Polls have shown a virtual dead heat between Cortez Masto and Laxalt.This Senate race isn t the sexiest in the country but it might be the most pivotal: Not only will it help determine which party controls the upper chamber next year. but also it will help answer how much U.S. voters actually care about the future of their democracy. Polls have shown that other issues matter as much or more to Nevadans: Inflation. crime. gun policy and immigration all ranked as top items in a recent CBS pollof Nevadans. But they won t get debated by the Senate candidates on live television: Neither Cortez Masto nor Laxalt seem willing to risk making a misstep on stage in such a closely contested election.The political momentum seems to have shifted away from Democrats in the closing weeks of the 2022 campaign. The average price of gas is on the rebound upward and inflation has proved more stubborn than economists had hoped. Republicans are optimistic that kitchen table issues — and an onslaught of scary-sounding ads about crime — will carry them to victory in Nevada and elsewhere around the country.Cortez Masto made history in 2016 when she was elected as the first Latina senator amid high voter turnout and the showdown between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Democrats also did well in Nevada in the 2018 midterms thanks to a backlash to Trump s policies. Trump isn t on the ballot this year and President Joe Biden s approval rating is underwater. a key obstacle as Democrats seek to get as many people engaged in a midterm election as possible.Nevada Democrats are again relying on the famed political machine associated with Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to turn out the vote on Election Day. including hundreds of Latino and union activists. The influential Culinary Union claimed to have launched the  largest  get-out-the-vote operation over the weekend. knocking on 610.000 doors and engaging in over 100.000 conversations with voters. The biggest corporations have been using the pandemic to price gouge working families but we are fighting back and we have a plan to win.  Ted Pappageorge. secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union. said in a statement.  No voter believes Republicans are going to take on massive Wall Street landlords who are stealing our homes and ruining our neighborhoods. But there are nagging questions over Democratic performance among Hispanic voters in Nevada and around the country. Trump overperformed with Hispanic voters in 2016 and 2020. During special elections earlier this year. Republicans made surprising gains in heavily Hispanic areas in Texas. If that trend is replicated in other parts of the Southwest. it could mean even bigger Democratic losses in November.Nevada voters were able to cast their ballots beginning Saturday and the early signs weren t encouraging for Democrats. Turnout was  way down  in Clark County. the Democratic stronghold anchored by the city of Las Vegas. according to veteran Nevada journalist Jon Ralston. But that may have been due to inclement weather or simply because more people are voting by mail this election.Laxalt. the son of former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici and the grandson of U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt. last ran for office in 2018. when he lost the governor s race to Democrat Steve Sisolak. He s a conservative with the backing of both the GOP establishment and Trump. But his embrace of the 2020 election conspiracy was a step too far for prominent Republicans who became disillusioned by the direction of their party in recent years and are now backing Cortez Masto. He is busy pushing lies. conspiracies. and defending the absolutely indefensible. This is irresponsible behavior that puts our democracy at risk and is not something we should accept from our elected representatives or those that are seeking office.  businessman Robert Cashell Jr.. the son of former Reno Mayor Bob Cashell. said Friday. Cashell told HuffPost he agreed with Republicans who fault Democrats for spending too much money and who say that has exacerbated inflation. But he suggested that  too much irresponsible rhetoric  coming from GOP politicians is a determining factor in how he is voting in the Senate election.Former Washoe County Sheriff Mike Haley. meanwhile. called Laxalt  unfit to serve  given his response to the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Again and again. Adam Laxalt has said nothing  about injured and killed police officers at the Capitol. Haley said.  Instead of speaking up and supporting public safety like he professes. Laxalt said the attack was exaggerated by the media. Laxalt said he believes the  very few who broke laws during the Capitol attack should be prosecuted. But he also thinks Democrats are exaggerating the situation.  This day was not the darkest day in American history. not even close.  he said earlier this year.Cortez Masto described it in a different way. She said she personally witnessed the  total destruction  at the Capitol after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Trump paraphernalia everywhere.  Cortez Masto recalled on Friday.  Offices turned upside down. My Capitol office survived. but the two next to me were broken into. Furniture ripped apart and flipped upside down. TVs pulled off the wall. They were determined to not only destroy the Capitol — the people s house — but to try to stop what I took an oath of office to do. She then told a vivid story about the moment she first realized something was wrong that day: running into a Capitol police officer in a restroom. flushing pepper spray out of his eyes. Police officers later described a  medieval  battlefield playing out on the Capitol grounds. featuring hand-to-hand combat. Five people died and more than 140 officers were injured. This is about standing up for our true democracy and calling out those who don t and holding them accountable.  she said.  The best way to do that right now is through our votes. ,Politics News

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and venture capitalist Tom Steyer both spent substantial portions of their own multibillion-dolllar fortunes trying to win the presidency in 2020. Both men came up short in the Democratic primaries. though each had consolation prizes: Bloomberg managed to win American Samoa s delegates and Steyer got to dance onstage to  Back That Ass Up  with Juvenile.After their losses. however. each man also poured millions of dollars into efforts to defeat former President Donald Trump. Steyer gave tens of millions to NextGen America. a group he founded focused on increasing youth turnout. Bloomberg donated more than $100 million to various political action committees. including his gun safety-focused group Everytown.This cycle. however. with Republicans nominating candidate after candidate who denies the results of the 2020 election and after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. both men are giving substantially less to Democratic efforts. part of a wave of major Democratic donors who have cut back their giving. often arguing their efforts to defeat Trump two years ago were sufficient or feeling uncertain whether their money will be put to good use. But in the case of Bloomberg and Steyer. there is a seemingly obvious and cynical reason their giving has slowed down.  They were running for president in 2020. They were willing to put over $100 million in.  said one major Democratic donor. requesting anonymity because of Bloomberg s and Steyer s ongoing power in the party.  If they [aren t] running. there [isn t] anything to gain personally for them. While Senate Democratic candidates have used strong campaign fundraising to hold off GOP super PACs. House Democrats are getting walloped. with the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee telling HuffPost in an interview earlier this month the party needed large donors to step up. Moreover. both Steyer s and Bloomberg s past efforts have focused on subgroups — young voters and suburban swing voters — that could make or break Democratic chances in key seats.In a phone interview. Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson noted the media mogul was still likely to be the single largest donor to Democratic Party efforts in 2022. Bloomberg will give $60 million. including $11 million to House Majority PAC. a super PAC controlled by allies of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. $5 million or more to the League of Conservation Voters and EMILY s List. and $1 million donations to different Democratic gubernatorial efforts. (The Washington Post first reported Bloomberg s plans.)The $60 million. however. is less than the $95 million he spent in 2018 or the $155 million he poured into defeating Trump in 2020. never mind the $1 billion he spent on his own presidential bid in 2020.  Every election is important.  Wolfson said.  But the Trump-Biden election was pretty existential to the future of the country. This year s elections are also really important. but if I had to rank them. I would say the 2020 election was more important. Interviews with Democratic operatives who work extensively with donors found the idea the midterm elections are less important than defeating Trump to be. in their eyes. frustratingly common.  If you re not giving now. what was the point of giving before?  asked one Democratic operative working extensively on House races. who requested anonymity to frankly discuss his frustration with some of the party s biggest donors.  The threat is more real today than it s ever been. A genuine problem we have in Democratic politics today is convincing some of our supporters that Republicans actually mean what they say.   January 6th was less than two years ago.  the operative said. referring to the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Leah Greenberg. the co-executive director of the progressive group Indivisible. noted the midterms are going to set the table for the 2024 election — which could possibly be a Trump vs. Biden rematch. The outcomes of 2022 are going to determine the ground we re fighting on in 2024. and whether we will even have free and fair elections. This is an election where election deniers are on the ballot from the Senate and gubernatorial levels all the way down to the local election administration offices.  Greenberg said.  We can t afford to concede anything without fighting it out right now. In some ways. megadonors backing off is unsurprising: Midterm campaigns always cost less to run than presidential ones. and the amount of money poured into Democratic efforts in 2020 from both small and large donors was record-shattering. with the cash not always put to productive use.  My guess is there are a lot of average people who will do less in 2022 than they did in 2020.  Wolfson said. Many donors felt burned after giving to 2020 Senate campaigns. such as Jaime Harrison s in South Carolina and Amy McGrath s in Kentucky. that ended up losing badly. There is also a general pessimism about Democratic chances in the midterms. And finally. the stock market s recent slump has some donors pinching their admittedly expansive wallets.And ultimately. pointing fingers at donors for a poor Democratic performance in November would tell only a small slice of the story. Substantially lower gas prices or rates of inflation. or higher presidential approval ratings. would do far more for the party s chances than any check.Steyer. for his part. has donated a smaller amount to NextGen than he has in the past. Massive donations of $60 million for the 2018 cycle and nearly $50 million for the 2020 cycle funded thousands of organizers nationally. who rallied community colleges. small HBCUs. massive state universities and younger suburban moms to vote for Democrats. (In total. Steyer donated $73 million to all candidates and PACs in 2018 and $75 million in 2020.) This year. NextGen has raised just $5.6 million as of its last Federal Election Commission report. Last week. it announced it was co-sponsoring a youth voter tour with the progressive group MoveOn.org. sending Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to the swing states of Michigan. Nevada. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The group has hired 140 field organizers across eight states. looking at 186 different college campuses. It s also continued working with influencers and college athletes with substantial social media followings to encourage young people to register and vote.In an email. a spokesperson for Steyer wrote that the venture capitalist is using a new firm — Galvanize Climate Solutions — to capitalize on the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and spur clean energy development.  Tom believes this is the time for the private sector to lead in terms of climate response.  Niyati Narang wrote.  At Galvanize. he is fully focused on deploying critical climate solutions at scale and mobilizing private sector actors to invest in climate solutions. Narang noted Steyer s $5 million donation to NextGen and wrote the  next phase of organizational growth for NextGen America will include building a broad base of support which will be key to the long-term sustainability of the organization. While Biden has unveiled two major policies with theoretical appeal for young people in recent months — student debt cancellation and moving toward the decriminalization of marijuana — the president has not mentioned them consistently while campaigning. and some progressives are increasingly worried about reaching young voters. the most liberal bloc of the American electorate. I am worried about the level of voter turnout among young people and working people who will be voting Democratic.  Sanders bluntly said on CNN s  State of the Union  on Sunday.Youth turnout could make or break this election cycle. Older voters always dominate midterm elections. but Democrats did far better in 2018 — when youth voters matched increased turnout for older voters — than they did in elections when younger people stayed home such as in 2014 and 2010.A CBS News analysis earlier this month found if young people s turnout matched 2018 levels. making them roughly a third of the electorate. control of the House would switch from leaning toward the GOP to a toss-up. Bloomberg. on the other hand. has long focused his political operation on appealing to moderate voters in the suburbs. a group that overwhelmingly backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but has been lukewarm on Democratic House candidates in both 2020 and 2022. It was a late cash blitz from Bloomberg that delivered suburban Democrats like Lucy McBath of Georgia and Kendra Horn of Oklahoma to Congress in 2018. And the $20 million he spent boosting Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) on gun control issues was considered critical to the Republican s 2016 victory. (Bloomberg was still a registered independent when he backed Toomey.)This time around. Everytown is airing ads on gun control. part of a Democratic counterpush on GOP ads on crime. But the amount spent is much lower. In Pennsylvania. for instance. Bloomberg has spent just over $1 million backing John Fetterman for the U.S. Senate. Steyer and Bloomberg are not the only major donors who have pulled back. Donald Sussman. a hedge fund manager who has given millions to Democrats in the past. has not made substantial contributions this year in protest of Democrats  failure to pass voting rights legislation. Most aggravating to progressives. however. is the disappearance of a slew of big-money funders who backed moderate Democrats in House primaries around the country before disappearing in the lead-up to the general election. Pro-Israel groups spent more than $28 million attacking progressive Democrats. but most have done next to nothing as the party battles Republicans.In particular. the crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried has drawn the ire of progressives. Bankman-Fried. a proponent of effective altruism. has a number of pet issues including pandemic prevention and cryptocurrency regulation. and his giving during the primaries was not ideologically consistent. But he appears to have shut off the money spigot for the general election after spending $40 million earlier in the cycle and once speculating he could spend $1 billion. That was a dumb quote on my part.  the Bahamas-based 30-year-old told Politico Pro earlier this month.  I think my messaging was sort of sloppy and inconsistent in some cases. He added he saw less opportunity to advance his favored causes in a general election:  Frankly. I could try and talk about pandemic preparedness in a general election. But most voters are gonna say. ‘That s cool. but like. I m a Democrat  or ‘I m a Republican.  To Greenberg and others. however. the disappearance of Bankman-Fried and pro-Israel groups is evidence they are unreliable partners to the Democratic cause.  I think it s irresponsible to give people expectations that they think they can rely on. and then taking your ball and going home during a general election that s going to be a huge fight for the future of the nation s democracy.  Greenberg said. At this point. however. there is little donors can do. Advertising rates are much lower when booked months in advance. so substantial donations won t go as far at this point in the cycle. For example. one Democratic strategist told HuffPost a single spot on broadcast television in Las Vegas — which has contested gubernatorial and Senate races. plus three contested House races and numerous down-ballot contests — now costs $7.000.  The best programs are ones you actually have time to develop and plan. and donors who wake up on Oct. 10 with six ideas don t help matters.  said the strategist. who requested anonymity to criticize the people who sign his paychecks.  It s more of a problem when there s less dollars and you make up your mind late. Moreover. the simple fact that the decisions. whims and health of a few billionaires can have such seismic political impact points to the absurdity of the nation s campaign finance laws. which have been gutted by a Supreme Court that equates money with speech and an FEC driven to paralysis by GOP obstruction. It s not healthy for our system to be in a position where single donors can have such a big influence.  Greenberg said.  We are all facing a system where the unchecked power of dark money can shape the election. ,Politics News
Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appear to be texting buddies. The New York Times reported Monday.Tim Michels. the Republican nominee for Wisconsin governor. recently shared an anecdote about an exchange he witnessed between the seven-time Super Bowl champion and the potential GOP presidential hopeful.Michels said at a meeting of the far-right Lake County Patriots on Thursday that he recently hosted DeSantis at a Green Bay Packers game in the venerable Lambeau Field. The Times was denied entry to the meeting but obtained a recording. I look over and he s texting and he says. ‘How do you spell Lambeau?   Michels recalled.Michels asked him whom he was texting and said DeSantis replied:  I m texting with Tom Brady. The governor of Florida gets to text with Tom Brady.  I m hoping that when I m governor of Wisconsin. I can text Aaron Rodgers.  Michels added.HuffPost reached out to DeSantis s office. as well as Brady through the Buccaneers. but neither responded to a request for comment.The nature of the text beyond small talk wasn t known. But the notion that Brady and DeSantis appear to be on casual terms might bring to mind the quarterback s relationship with former President Donald Trump.Brady and Trump have golfed together. called each other friends and exchanged mutual admiration over the years. In 2015. Brady was spotted with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker and said Trump had  done amazing things.  But he stopped short of endorsing Trump during his 2016 run for the presidency and declined to appear at the Republican National Convention in celebration of Trump s first nomination.The 45-year-old Brady s decision to un-retire has been followed by a miserable season on and off the field. The Buccaneers lost to lowly Carolina. 21-3. on Sunday to drop their record to 3-4. Brady and his wife. Gisele Bundchen. have reportedly lawyered up for a potential divorce.,Politics News
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) defended himself against charges that he supports police funding cuts and accused his Republican challenger. Jim Schultz. of posing a threat to abortion rights in their fourth and final debate on Sunday night. I ve asked for literally millions of dollars over the course of four years of my term so that we can put violent criminals in prison when counties call on us to do it.  Ellison declared in the debate. which was hosted by KSTP-TV. Defunding the police was never a good idea and it was even worse phrasing.  he added later in the debate.Ellison. a former public-interest lawyer. state lawmaker. and member of Congress. has indeed never supported defunding the police.  I don t think the binary is pro-police/anti-police.  he told HuffPost for a June 2020 profile.But Schultz blasted Ellison in particular for supporting a  yes  vote on Question 2. a 2021 referendum in Minneapolis that would have replaced the city s police department with a more multifaceted department of public safety. Schultz. a Harvard-educated hedge fund attorney. called the referendum. which voters rejected. a plan to  defund and dismantle Minnesota s largest police force.   That s not just dumb or wrong.  he said.  It is immoral. Ellison noted that Fox 9. a local TV station. has called efforts to conflate support for the passage of Question 2 with  defunding  the Minneapolis police force  misleading.   What people in Minneapolis were looking for is a better way forward.  he said.If the referendum had passed. Minneapolis would have been free to implement a more public-health-driven approach to tackling crime that advocates hoped would combine traditional law enforcement techniques with more progressive outreach methods. The city would no longer have been required to maintain a certain ratio of police officers per population. but the city council would have been free to allot as much funding for officers as it wanted.Many other prominent Minnesota Democrats. including Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D). nonetheless advocated against Question 2 and it ended up being defeated by 14 percentage points. Ellison. by contrast. joined more left-leaning figures like Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in supporting the referendum s passage. Omar and Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.). who campaigned for Ellison earlier in the week. have embraced both the  defund the police  slogan and the underlying call to reduce police funding in favor of other social programs. The fact is. Keith Ellison is on an island with a few radicals around the country.  Schultz said.  And that s representative of how extreme he is in Minnesota. Schultz also sought to blame Ellison for failing to do enough to stem the uptick in violent crime in Minnesota. claiming that Ellison has  sat on his hands  amid the surge in crime.But Ellison noted that the attorney general only takes on the prosecution of crimes at the invitation of county prosecutors. In the 50 such cases that Ellison has presided over. the attorney general s office has a perfect conviction rate. he said. My opponent has never set foot in a courtroom and is basically just fear-mongering.  he said.If Schultz has tried to make crime the theme of the campaign. Ellison has focused on abortion rights. where he believes he has an advantage over Schultz.He maintains that Schultz cannot be trusted to protect Minnesotans  right to a  safe. legal  abortion.Ellison noted that Schultz has served on the board of the Human Life Alliance. an anti-abortion group. and promised during the GOP primary to  go on offense. offense. offense  against abortion rights if elected.Schultz claimed that he would not let his anti-abortion views get in the way of defending Minnesota s existing abortion rights protections in court.  I said [during the primary] that I will not leverage the Attorney General s Office of Minnesota for abortion policy.  he said.  I said that openly and people on the right attacked me and now Keith is attacking me from the left.  Ellison warned people against believing Schultz s assurances. comparing them to those of conservative Supreme Court justices who suggested. as nominees. that they would uphold a constitutional right to abortion but voted to overturn it this past June with the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization. All of them said they will preserve the right to abortion. They all flipped it.  Ellison said.  He s going to do the same thing. After a hard-fought election win in 2018. Ellison earned national fame for his role in the successful prosecution of Derek Chauvin. the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd in May 2020.But nearly two and a half years after Floyd s death. a national rise in violent crime that has not spared Minnesota has put Ellison on the defensive.Polling shows Ellison and Schultz locked in a dead heat for the state s top law enforcement role.,Politics News

Abortion access has taken center stage this election season since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. and Americans are preparing to head to the polls to vote for the candidates they believe best represents their views on reproductive rights. But voters in five states will directly decide the future of abortion access in their communities.California. Kentucky. Michigan. Montana and Vermont have ballot initiatives to protect or restrict access to abortion care. Four initiatives are amendments to the state constitution. the fifth. Montana. is a legislative referendum. a ballot issue proposed by a minimum number of citizens in the state. Three proposals – in California. Michigan and Vermont – seek to protect abortion care. while the remaining two aim to restrict it. In August. Kansas became the first state to ask voters whether it should further restrict or protect abortion access. In a landmark election. Kansans rejected the anti-choice constitutional amendment — a massive win for pro-choice advocates that set the tone for what s to come on abortion rights nationally. Turning up at the polls in states where abortion is on the ballot this year is critical. because as we demonstrated in Kansas. voting is one of the most powerful tools we have to secure our rights.  said Nigel Morton. a Kansas state organizer at URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity. who helped defeat the anti-choice amendment this summer.  Our win in Kansas carried a crucial message. We ― everyday people ― will look out for each other.  added Morton.  Now it s up to communities in states like Kentucky and Michigan to do the same. Read more below about the five states where abortion rights are on the ballot this midterm. California s ballot initiative. Proposition 1. is a pro-choice constitutional amendment that would codify abortion and contraceptive protections in the state constitution. It would change the California Constitution  to say that the state cannot deny or interfere with a person s reproductive freedom and that people have the fundamental right to choose  whether to have an abortion or use contraceptives. the proposition reads. If voters approve the amendment. a new section will be added to the state s constitution:  The state shall not deny or interfere with an individual s reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions. which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives. A  yes  vote favors abortion protections. while a  no  vote is against abortion protections. If the amendment fails. however. abortion will remain legal in California until the point of viability. usually around 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy. The California proposition is likely to pass in the progressive state. and the campaign supporting the ballot initiative has raised over $9 million. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). along with Democratic California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla. have voiced support for Proposition 1. Constitutional Amendment 2 is an anti-abortion amendment titled the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment. As the title states. the amendment would codify that Kentucky does not protect the right to abortion or require funding for abortion care. The ballot question will ask voters whether they favor adding a new section to the state constitution that reads:  To protect human life. nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion. Kansas voters rejectedThe amendment is redundant because a trigger abortion ban went into effect weeks after the Supreme Court repealed Roe. The trigger law is a near-total abortion ban with narrow exceptions. including if the pregnant person s health is at serious risk. There were only two abortion clinics in Kentucky before Roe fell. Both offer other reproductive and sexual health care services. but neither offers abortion care. Pro-choice advocates have challenged the trigger ban and a state law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy in court. Although litigation is ongoing. both bans have been allowed to stand. If the amendment fails. it could help the ACLU and other complainants in a Nov. 15 hearing on litigation against the trigger ban. large evangelical populationMichigan s Proposal 3. or the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative. is likely the most consequential ballot initiative this election. The pro-abortion rights proposal aims to codify reproductive freedom into the Michigan Constitution. The proposal defines reproductive freedom as  the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy. including but not limited to prenatal care. childbirth. postpartum care. contraception. sterilization. abortion care. miscarriage management. and infertility care.  A  yes  vote for the amendment favors abortion rights. while a  no  vote is against abortion rights. All eyes are on Michigan because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is the only thing standing in the way of state lawmakers seeking to severely restrict or ban abortion care. A 1931 abortion ban went into effect in Michigan after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. but a state court put the ban on hold. Whitmer. a staunch advocate for reproductive rights. filed a lawsuit against the pre-Roe ban before Roe had fallen in an attempt to block the near-total abortion ban from going into effect. saidRepublicanswin the two open state Supreme Court seatsVoters in Montana will cast their vote on the Medical Care Requirements for Born-Alive Infants Measure on Nov. 8. If passed. the anti-choice referendum would require infants born alive – including after induced labor. C-section and attempted abortion – to be defined as legal persons who are  entitled to medically appropriate care and treatment.  according to the referendum language.The measure defines a  born-alive infant  as one  who breathes. has a beating heart. or has definite movement of voluntary muscles. after the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother.  If a health care provider does not take  medically appropriate and reasonable actions  to preserve the life of a  born-alive infant.  they are vulnerable to criminal penalties. including a $50.000 fine or up to a 20-year prison sentence. Montana law allows abortion up to viability or somewhere between 24 to 26 weeks. chilling effect on patients and physiciansProposal 5. or the Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment. is a pro-choice ballot measure that would codify the right to abortion and other reproductive health care into the Vermont Constitution. The measure states that  an individual s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.  A  yes  vote for the amendment favors abortion rights. while a  no  vote is against abortion rights. There are currently no abortion restrictions in Vermont. If the amendment fails. Vermonters will continue to be able to access abortion care at any point in their pregnancy. The amendment is likely to pass and has garnered support from Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R). U.S. Rep. Peter Welch (D) and Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos (D). ,Politics News

The president of the American Medical Association has called out anti-abortion politicians who are interfering with the personal medical decisions of the American people.said on MSNBCResneck said that. in emergency rooms across the country. doctors are being placed in difficult situations where they re forced to consult with attorneys before administering potentially life-saving treatment to women experiencing pregnancy complications. This is really creating chaos in some of these restrictive states around the country. It s placing patient lives at risk. and we re extraordinarily concerned.  he said.overturned Roe v. Wadeabortiontestified to CongressAsked about that statement Sunday. he said the consequences were beginning to appear. We know what happens when pregnant patients who either need or want an abortion can t get one.  he said.  Sometimes they turn to self-managed abortions. and we know from history and from other countries as well. the bad medical consequences of that. Sometimes they have the resources and are able to travel to another state. but lines are getting longer in those states. And so people are getting abortions later in pregnancy as a result. He pointed to a recent study in Texas on pregnant women who experienced complications but didn t have the option to terminate their pregnancies right away due to the new legislation. The rates of serious complications. such as infections and needing ICU care. were far higher in Texas than they were in other states that didn t have similar bans on abortion. Resneck said.He also noted that abortion shouldn t be a partisan issue. We re a nonpartisan organization. I will show up and work with anybody. anytime. from any party. that s willing to advance our evidence-based policy and follow science and advance the health of the nation.  he said.Roe v.

The Trump Organization has said it did nothing wrong and that it looks forward  to having our day in court. Judge Juan Manuel Merchan expects the criminal tax fraud trial. heavy on financial records and expert testimony. to take at least four weeks once a jury is seated.

Trump would be 78..A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs ResearchDemocrats I think the best way to make the judgement is to watch me. Am I slowing up? Am I going at the same pace?  Biden said in the interview that was taped Friday during a visit to the Delaware State University campus to promote his student loan debt forgiveness executive order.Biden has yet to officially announce whether he will run for a second term. but has repeatedly said it is his intention to seek reelection.During his 2020 campaign. Biden often presented himself as a  transition candidate  who would build a bridge to new Democratic talent.The age and health of both Biden and Trump loomed throughout a race that was decided by a younger and more diverse electorate and at a moment when the nation is facing no shortage of issues of consequence.In the MSNBC interview.

PHOENIX — Democrat Katie Hobbs said she doesn t regret her decision not to debate her Republican opponent for governor. Kari Lake — a move that even some of her supporters don t agree with given such a tight race. A debate never helps a candidate win.  the secretary of state told HuffPost after an event Saturday with about a dozen people at a restaurant in Glendale. Arizona.  I mean. it is — we re talking to voters and I guarantee it s not something they re concerned about. I guarantee the person who is rationing their insulin or opening their refrigerator and figuring out how they re going to put food on the table with the groceries they have left for the week ... isn t going to open their ballot and say. ‘Damn. I wish Katie had done a debate.  polling average spectacle It s not uncommon for strong incumbents to pass on debates with lesser-known challengers. It s much less common in a close race for an open seat.Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has already debated his challenger. first-time candidate and venture capitalist Blake Masters. Everything about [Lake] is a distraction from the fact that she has no experience. no qualifications. no plans to lead the state.  Hobbs told HuffPost.  She s spent a career reading off a teleprompter. and she s trying to distract from the fact that she s not ready for the job. The daggers aren t just from Republicans. Prominent Democrats are frustrated with Hobbs. a former social worker and legislator. for her refusal to debate and run a more aggressive campaign against the telegenic. Donald Trump-backed Lake. something supporters alluded to in conversations at events this weekend. The average voter these days. I don t think they care one way or another.  said Martin Quezada. the Democrat candidate for Arizona treasurer who debated his opponent. Kimberly Yee. this month.  But for me. I think I would have preferred that she debated. But I can t blame her for not debating. Kari Lake is really good at turning that into a show and performance. she s a professional. Hobbs is not. That s not her style of governing. Cathy LaSusa. a Hobbs supporter from El Mirage. also said she understands the reasons for rejecting a debate but wishes Democrats were more into  fighting for democracy  and not  taking the high road  all the time. I know that people were disappointed that Katie didn t want to debate.  she said.  But on the other hand. we need to stand up to these people. which is a near impossible feat. The debate issue has come up during the course of phone-banking. she added.  People were disappointed. But they understood once I explained [why].  LaSusa said.Lake flayed Hobbs at a western-themed rally on Saturday. drawing a crowd of several thousand to a ranch north of Phoenix for a rodeo and country music. One couple showed up dressed like  Where s Waldo?  and waved a sign that read  Where s Katie?  — an apparent dig at Hobbs for not going head to head with Lake and not being as visible on the campaign trail. My opponent Hobbs — racist Hobbs — refuses to show up for any type of debate.  Lake told the crowd.  I said. ‘Katie. you pick the place. You pick the moderator. Even if [ The View  host] Joy Behar wants to moderate. I m OK with that.  I said. ‘Katie. you pick the questions. Just show up and stand before the people of Arizona. They deserve to hear from you.  Other Hobbs voters waved off concerns about any electoral fallout from the two candidates not meeting onstage before the Nov. 8 election. I don t think it would make a difference.  said Monica Pimentel. a school board member from Glendale.  Kari Lake is professional talker. She knows how to spin a story. that s been her job for over 20 years. Katie Hobbs knows what the issues are. I believe that if she had to debate Kari Lake it would just be a circus. ,Politics News

We ve been very clear about a number of different criminal offenses that are likely at issue here.  Cheney said.

The scenario that keeps Adrian Fontes up at night goes something like this: It s December 2024. a month after President Joe Biden has. by all honest accounts. narrowly won reelection. A tight race came down to Arizona and its 11 Electoral College votes. which pushed Biden across the 270-vote threshold necessary to secure a second term.But Mark Finchem. after winning Arizona s secretary of state race in November 2022. has refused to certify the results of Biden s second consecutive victory in the state. just as he suggested he would. Four years after embracing the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. Finchem has followed through on his pledge to keep Democrats from  stealing  the election again. What happens to our democracy?  Fontes asked in a recent interview.  It s upturned. Democrats like Fontes. a former elections official and Finchem s opponent in Arizona s Nov. 8 secretary of state contest. are desperately seeking to prevent that scenario from having any chance to come to fruition.Finchem. who met with Trump s attorneys as they plotted the  fake electors  scheme in an effort to overturn the 2020 election. is among a cadre of election deniers who used this year s primary contests to almost completely take over the Republican Party. Such candidates won more than half of the GOP s primaries. including 11 for secretary of state positions and 11 more in attorney general contests ― roles that in most states would give them a direct hand in the oversight and management of elections.The problem is particularly stark in places like Arizona. one of three swing states ― along with Michigan and Nevada ― where election deniers won GOP nominations for both secretary of state and attorney general.The ability of election deniers to triumph in GOP primaries has heightened the stakes of typically sleepy down-ballot races. and Democrats in recent weeks have more clearly laid out the implications to voters: The 2024 presidential election and American democracy as a whole. they have argued. hang in the balance of this November s races. These are the offices that make democracy work.  said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D). whose Republican opponent. attorney Matthew DePerno. spread conspiracy theories that electronic voting machines were rigged against Trump. met with Trump officials in Washington. D.C.. on the day of the 2021 Capitol insurrection. and launched legal challenges seeking to overturn the results in one Michigan county. If we have the wrong people in these offices. it s not just that democracy won t function well.  Nessel said.  We won t have a functioning democracy at all. Many experts have long considered the decentralized nature of the U.S. election system ― in which the country s political contests are managed at the state and local level ― an important safeguard against the type of takeovers that have turned other democracies into so-called  competitive authoritarian  states. That term is used to describe nations that hold elections and maintain the pretense of democracy. but in which one party uses its power to create and maintain distinct advantages that render political opposition effectively powerless.That diffuse system. however. has now become  the soft underbelly of democracy  in the U.S.. said Brendan Nyhan. a Dartmouth political science professor and a co-organizer of Bright Line Watch. an academic collective that monitors and highlights risks to the country s democracy. The lack of centralization made it hard to rig an election simultaneously across the country.  Nyhan said.  But it also means that the system is permeable. That institutional choice has turned out to create a terrible vulnerability right now. It has also given the GOP a massive structural advantage. The Republican Party s near-total capitulation to its authoritarian impulses has left Democrats as the only bulwark against democratic collapse. To vanquish the threat that Republicans pose to the 2024 election and democracy as a whole. Democratic candidates need to win every race ― at least in major battleground states. Republican election deniers. by contrast. only have to win one such race in order to open the door to the kind of scenario Fontes describes. We re in this position where the poor Democrats have to win every election. have to run good candidates and not make mistakes...just to save democracy.  said Steven Levitsky. a Harvard political science professor and the author of  How Democracies Die.  a book originally published in 2018.  That s not a position we want to be in. Democrats would have to win numerous razor-thin races in order to pull off a clean sweep of swing state contests against the GOP s most prominent conspiracy theorists. Polls in down-ballot races are limited. but the Arizona secretary of state s race is a dead heat. with Finchem holding slight leads that land within the margin of error. In Nevada. former state Rep. Jim Marchant. a Republican. holds a lead in the secretary of state s race. Marchant has spread conspiracies about the 2020 contest. said he wouldn t have certified the outcome of that race. and waged a legal challenge seeking to overturn his own loss in a congressional race two years ago.The Democrats  prospects look better in Pennsylvania. where Republican election denier Doug Mastriano would appoint the secretary of state. He is currently trailing state Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) by roughly 10 points in polling averages.In Michigan. incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) leads her election-denying opponent. Kristina Karamo. according to polls. The attorney general s race between Nessel and DePerno. however. is within the margin of error. Arizona. Michigan. Nevada and Pennsylvania collectively represent a critical 51 Electoral College votes. and in a close race. any one state could prove decisive. The GOP s embrace of election lies remains broadly unpopular. Sixty percent of independents and 54% of voters overall say they wouldn t be comfortable casting a ballot for a candidate who spread election lies. according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday.Overall. however. voters appear to be prioritizing economic issues. including rising inflation. over the maintenance of democracy. and the first midterms of a new presidency historically favor the party not in the White House. In a two-party system. that has made election denial a more powerful political force than it might be in a multiparty democracy. In a democracy. both parties win.  Levitsky said.  In a democracy. inflation and crime rates piss people off. so they vote for the opposition party. But right now. when we vote for the opposition party. it s a bunch of authoritarian thugs. That s the risk: As long as the Republicans are an authoritarian party. every midterm election is going to be that way. Democrats like Fontes and Nessel have tried to make those risks clear to voters. A hostile secretary of state like Finchem. Fontes argued. could cause a litany of problems even before it came time to certify an election result. He could decertify electronic tabulation machines. or overhaul the election procedures manual that acts as a rulebook for election officials across the state. Fontes warned that Finchem and the GOP-controlled Arizona legislature could further target mail-in voting. the method by which roughly 90% of Arizonans typically cast ballots. We ve been running against the guy who has basically said he s willing to pick the winners. and stop people from voting. to muck up the system on purpose.  Fontes said of Finchem.  He has said it repeatedly and in a variety of different ways. DePerno. who won Trump s endorsement in the Michigan GOP primary. is currently under investigation from the state attorney general s office. which in August alleged that he helped orchestrate a scheme to improperly access and tamper with election machines in three Michigan counties. A special prosecutor is overseeing the case.As attorney general. DePerno could  wreak havoc  on Michigan s contests. Nessel said. leaving the state vulnerable to the sort of conspiratorial election challenges that DePerno helped lead in 2020. This is a man that has spread more misinformation and disinformation in his career than any attorney that I ve ever seen. He was hand-selected by Donald Trump in order to do his bidding.  Nessel said.  This is a man who does not even believe in the basic concept that we re a democracy. that the person who gets the most votes wins an election. And he s demonstrated that over and over again. The Times/Siena poll. however. found that while nearly three-quarters of American voters believe democracy to be under threat. few regard it as a major concern in this election. Democratic candidates acknowledge that it s been tough. at times. to persuade voters that their democracy is truly in peril. I have shouted this from the rooftops. and I ve done that ever since the experience I had in 2020.  Nessel said.  But candidly. sometimes I feel like I m screaming into the wind. More than half of Republicans still believe the 2020 election was stolen. and nearly half have little confidence that the 2022 elections will be legitimate. according to an Associated Press poll released this week. Nearly three-quarters of GOP voters are fine voting for an election denier. the Times/Siena poll found. That GOP voters want anti-democratic candidates. or at least will tolerate them. has made reaching across the aisle for pro-democracy votes almost impossible.A third of independent voters. meanwhile. are comfortable voting for an election denier. the Times/Siena poll found. and just 7% consider democracy their top priority ― potentially making it difficult to convince such voters that contests like the Arizona secretary of state race are existential battles for the country s future. It s kind of hard. because when you run around screaming ‘The sky is falling.  not a lot of people want to listen.  Fontes said.  Even if the sky is actually falling. and people really do need to be paying attention. Many Americans. Nyhan said. may not realize how close Trump came to actually stealing the 2020 election. Instead. people might lean on the more comforting idea that the country s democratic institutions ultimately held ― and will do so again. Sometimes people have taken too much confidence from what happened in 2020. and they say. well. it would be hard to steal an election.  he said.  But you don t have to steal it in the sense of literally stuffing the ballot box. All you have to do is create confusion and doubt. And I think that s unfortunately a much lower bar to clear than convincingly stealing an election. Voters  prioritization of other issues over fundamental questions of democracy is something frequently seen in countries where democracy is on the brink. Americans are broadly supportive of democracy in the abstract.  Nyhan said.  But at the same time. they may not have well-developed views about exactly what it means. And they may trade off those relatively abstract values for factors... that are closer to their core concerns. Across the world. he said. voters have proved  a weaker constraint on authoritarianism than we might hope. Democrats running for Senate or Congress. or to be a state s governor. can prioritize other policies that match voters  concerns. But that s a tougher task for down-ballot candidates for whom the economy isn t really a central responsibility of the office they re seeking. In an effort to broaden their appeal. Nessel and other Democratic attorney general candidates have presented themselves as bulwarks against the GOP s aggressive anti-abortion policies in the wake of the Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade this summer. Nessel has also touted her efforts to target price gouging amid concerns about high gas prices. Fontes. meanwhile. has leaned on his background as the county recorder in Maricopa County. Arizona s largest. He oversaw the county s elections in that role. and says he s introduced himself to voters as an official who s  done this before and isn t trying to upset the applecart. Democrats remain hopeful that their warnings will alarm voters who are just now tuning in to down-ballot races that don t often garner much attention early in campaign cycles. The party s campaign arms ― the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State and the Democratic Attorneys General Association ― have brought in record fundraising hauls that could help boost candidates in the final stages. and individual campaigns are financially well-positioned for the stretch run.Democrats have also sought to turn voters  attention to the contests in the closing stages of the race. Every Eligible American. an affiliate of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. recently launched a campaign aimed at young voters. who typically turn out in lower numbers for midterm elections.  Go Down for Democracy.  as the campaign is known. is laced with humor and sexual innuendos ― a recent ad promoting vote-by-mail is called  Lick It & Stick It  ― that its focus groups say are more likely to engage millennial and Generation Z voters than traditional campaign messaging. You ve just got to tell them. then you just keep telling them and keep telling them and keep telling them.  Fontes said.  I d be lying if I didn t say it was a lot of pressure. But it s the battle of our generation.  We will be looking to the American people to decide if they want to live in a democracy. or if they don t.  he said.  It s a binary choice. There s no middle ground here. ,Politics News

ANCHORAGE. Alaska (AP) — A Republican gubernatorial candidate in Alaska faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor.The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of  constant unwanted physical touching. sexual remarks. and sexual advances.  the Anchorage Daily News reported.The case did not show up in an online court records system Saturday. The woman s Anchorage-based attorney. Caitlin Shortell. said in an email to The Associated Press it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court. and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants. they must be held accountable.  Shortell said.The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases.Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska. and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. I have no comments on future litigation.  Pierce told the AP following the debate.He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election.  I ll be in the race.  he said.The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case. claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She also claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.An email seeking comment was sent to the borough s attorney. Sean Kelley.According to the lawsuit. the woman was Pierce s assistant for about 18 months. until June 2022.Pierce announced in August he would resign in September to focus on his campaign for governor. The borough assembly later released a statement stating Pierce was asked to consider voluntarily resigning after an employee made what were deemed to be credible claims of harassment against him.In the lawsuit. she claims Pierce touched her breast. made sexual remarks. falsely imprisoned her in his private office. kissed her neck and face. asked questions about her sex life and made unwanted and unsolicited embraces and massages.The borough has paid two other former employees a combined $267.000 in settlements for separate complaints against Pierce. the Daily News reported.In one. the borough paid former human resources director Sandra  Stormy  Brown $150.000 in a settlement after she claimed in a lawsuit that Pierce fired her after she told him she had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. She claimed gender discrimination. disability discrimination and creating a hostile work environment.The borough also paid $117.000 to settle a complaint from a subsequent human resources director if the employee agreed he would not make  further allegations of ‘illegal acts  by Mayor Pierce  and rescind his allegations of bullying. the Anchorage newspaper reported.,Politics News

HOBOKEN. N.J. — Audrey Truschke. a professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University. never thought her work could result in death threats and vicious vitriol. Yet Truschke. a scholar. mom. wife and author of three books. now sometimes needs armed security at public events.The publication of her first book. in 2016. challenging the predominant perception of 16th- and 17th-century Mughal kings — Muslim rulers who are widely vilified by Hindu nationalists — put a target on her back. Her email was bombarded with hate mail. Her Twitter account was inundated with threats. People wrote letters to news outlets about her.  It felt like the world exploded at me.  said Truschke. pushing back her dark hair to reveal the salt and pepper streaks that frame her face.  This was my first brush with hate email. I m sure it would seem like nothing to me now. Far-right Hindu nationalism. also referred to as Hindutva. is a political and extremist ideology that advocates for Hindu supremacy and seeks to transform a secular and diverse India into an ethnoreligious Hindu state. Hindu nationalism has been around for over 100 years and was initially inspired by ethnonationalism movements in early 20th-century Europe. including those in Germany and Italy. Champions of Hindutva have viciously targeted religious minorities including Muslims. Christians and Sikhs. and have sought to silence critics such as academics and activists. Hinduism. the faith. is not Hindutva the far-right movement. But the label Hindu can be categorized as a religious. political or racial identifier depending on who is using it. explained Manan Ahmed. a professor and historian of South Asia at Columbia University. Hindu nationalists. he said. are morphing the religious. political and racial into one identity in order to advance a supremacist. majoritarian agenda.People impacted by Hindutva in the U.S. say the movement has crept into their hometowns and workplaces. making life more dangerous for them and threatening to make their communities less diverse and tolerant. The ideology has deep ties to white nationalist movements across the globe. and the targets of nationalist groups warn that the impact could be deadly if Hindutva is not addressed and defeated.  We see Hindu nationalism as an ideology which seeks to transform India from a pluralistic secular democracy to a Hindu state in which non-Hindus are seen at best as second-class citizens and at worst targets for extermination and disenfranchisement of all sorts.  said Nikhil Mandalaparthy. the deputy executive director of Hindus for Human Rights. a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting pluralism and human rights in South Asia and in the U.S. It s a vision that we think is in direct opposition to a lot of the values of Hindu religious traditions.  he added.In India. Hindu nationalism can be traced back to the 1920s. The formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. or RSS. in 1925 fortified the core belief in a Hindu state for Hindus. despite India s secular constitution and the long history of ethnic and religious minorities in the country. The RSS has been banned three times since it was established. including after a former party member assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948.It was out of the RSS that India s ruling political party. the Bharatiya Janata Party. or BJP. emerged. It has held power since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected in 2014.Since then. the crackdown on India s minorities. particularly Muslims. has intensified with little to no accountability.In April. bulldozers razed houses in majority-Muslim neighborhoods under dubious pretenses. Schools have banned Muslim students from wearing a hijab. Courts and government bodies have overturned convictions or withdrawn cases that accused Hindus of involvement in violence against Muslims. Hindu mobs routinely attack Muslims with little to no condemnation from the government. Hindu nationalism has redefined the Indian mainstream.  Truschke said.  It s an incredible success story. Fifty years ago. no respectable Indian wanted to touch it. It was just completely verboten due to the Hindutva embrace of violence and hate. and now it s the dominant political position in India. Other parts of the world. including the U.S.. have not been immune to growing support for Hindutva.Indian Americans make up the second-largest immigrant group in the United States. with nearly 4.2 million people of Indian origin living in the country. according to data from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The community is a diverse one. comprising both immigrants and American-born citizens who come from a variety of religious and socioeconomic backgrounds. The Carnegie poll indicates that at least 54% of Indian Americans report belonging to the Hindu faith. one of the largest and oldest religions in the world. There are about 1 billion Hindus around the world. and nearly 94% live in India. Around 2.5 million Hindus reside in the U.S. alone.Indian Americans hold mixed opinions on the present trajectory of India s democracy. but nearly half — particularly Republicans. Hindus and those not born in the U.S. — approve of Modi s performance as India s prime minister. In Texas. more than 50.000 people gathered to see him during a 2019 event called  Howdy Modi.  In many ways. the rise of Hindu nationalism mirrors the rise of white nationalist extremism. Anders Behring. the far-right Norwegian terrorist who killed 77 people. many of them teenagers. in 2011. reportedly praised Hindu nationalist groups who attacked Muslims in his manifesto. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. an Indian politician who became the face of Hindu nationalism in the 1920s. once applauded Hitler and said that India should treat Muslims the same way Nazis treated Jews.Like white supremacists. Hindu nationalists have propagated a revisionist history built on the idea that India. despite its secular constitution. once was and should still be a Hindu state and that members of other religious groups are not true natives of the country.  When we talk about threats to democracy and threats to multicultural. pluralist. way of life. of course. here in the U.S.. our concern is white supremacy and Christian nationalism.  Mandalaparthy said.  But there are so many ways in which the Hindu nationalist movement here is trying to ally itself with white supremacist groups and with groups who are seeking to destroy democracy here in this country. Many Indian Americans. including those who are Hindu. have faced hate crimes and discrimination as minorities in the U.S. But Hindu nationalists often use  Hinduphobia  as a disingenuous claim to shut down valid criticism of Hindu nationalist political ideology. Mandalaparthy said.  It s dangerous to contribute to this narrative of rising anti-Hindu sentiments because the people who are using this language the most are then turning back on members of our own communities and those who speak out against Hindu nationalism or caste or Islamophobia.  he said. reportIt can also mean threatening people who raise awareness about the ideology. contentiousBut the severity of the new attacks. which Truschke said felt unprovoked. was unprecedented. She received a staggering amount of hate mail and tweets. with about one tweet coming in every minute. she said. People made memes out of her photos and laced their messages with antisemitism and misogyny. They threatened her and her children. promising they d find her family if she continued to speak out. She reported several threats to the police. and one was even forwarded to Homeland Security last July. After receiving several credible threats. venues that hosted Truschke hired armed security to be by her side at public events. Keep loving Mughals and we ll keep loving Hitler you stupid jew.  read one tweet. I wouldn t mind if this female bitch is beheaded.  read another comment. Be in your home. you don t know from where you will be kidnapped.  read a message sent to her on Facebook. I will chop ur head if I get a chance.  read another.In September 2021. organizers of an online academic conference on Hindutva were also bombarded with thousands of threats of rape. violence and death. Several participants withdrew from the conference out of fear. Dozens of organizers and speakers said violent threats were made against their families. More than 30.000 threats were sent to one university. causing the server to crash. Data collected by Columbia University s Ahmed and other researchers indicate that the majority of tweets deployed against the conference organizers and participants were generated by individuals. not botsNew Jersey in Augustbulldozers that have targeted Muslimsvideos captured men The alignment between Hindu nationalism and right-wing nationalist groups is flourishing in the U.S.. which  doesn t bode well for any marginalized groups.  Mandalaparthy said.  This is very much a domestic issue now and it s very much a local issue. religious minoritiesrecommended reportFor more than 30 years. Minhaj Khan. a 48-year-old software engineer from South Brunswick. New Jersey. has prioritized giving back to his Indian community. At first. it was in the form of charity. especially right after moving to the U.S. in the late 1990s. He visited India often. especially since his extended family and sister still resided there.But soon that charity became advocacy. and advocacy became a personal responsibility. As an American. an Indian. and a Muslim. Khan couldn t look away from the human rights violations happening in his home state. When we use our free speech here. it makes a difference on the other side of the world.  Khan said.  Nobody is better than us presenting these issues to the American people.  Khan and Mohammed Jawad. the president of the Indian American Muslim Council. an advocacy organization. led a campaign against the bulldozer that was paraded in Edison. New Jersey. this summer. In the days after the parade. members of IAMC and other organizations met with members of the state s Department of Justice and its Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. as well as with the state attorney general s office. The organization also raised concerns after a local church invited a Hindu nationalist to speak. The church later canceled the event.The group s work hasn t gone unnoticed. The IAMC received a summons from one of India s lower courts because of its activism. though it has no legal grounds in the U.S.Khan remembers harmony between his family and his Hindu neighbors when he was growing up in India.  Muslims and Hindus. we were always together. side by side. They came to our place. we went to their place.  he said.  We never differentiated among ourselves. We lived comfortably. But with Hindu nationalism on the rise. those relationships are being strained. particularly in New Jersey. which has the largest South Asian population of any state in the U.S. In some cities in the state. South Asians make up around 40% of the population. Khan adjusts the sleeves of his brown button-down that is cuffed at his elbows. revealing a green pattern that matches the color of his eyes. He is particularly concerned about how Hindu extremism will impact his children. I am incredibly proud to be an American Muslim. This is the land of freedom. This is the land of justice. I am a free Muslim. I can practice my faith here in America perhaps best as compared to anywhere on the planet. I am equally proud of my Indian origin. the land of my birth.  Khan said.  That is why it pains us to witness the current regime in India trying to take away the most beautiful aspect of the land — its richness. diversity and inclusivity — and now export it even to America. For Truschke. the attacks on her life and on her work have only emboldened her to pursue her work head-on. Instead of focusing only on history. she is currently dedicating a research project to the present and the future of Hindu nationalism in the U.S.Hindutva Harassment Field Manual Hindu nationalism is threatening American multicultural values.  Truschke said.  If you like diversity. if you believe people who are different and who follow different religions should live together and that we are all Americans. Hindutva is a threat to that. and it is growing. It is not going away. It s likely to get worse.  Hindu nationalists have targeted Truschke s employer and colleagues over her work. Rutgers University told HuffPost in an emailed statement that it stood by Truschke s work. saying  scholarship is sometimes controversial. perhaps especially when it is at the interface of history and religion. but the freedom to pursue such scholarship. as Professor Truschke does rigorously. is at the heart of the academic enterprise.  Just as strongly. Rutgers-Newark emphatically affirms its support for all members of the Hindu community to study and live in an environment in which they not only feel safe. but also fully supported in their religious identity.  the statement continued. Truschke s eldest daughter is starting to notice that her mother is getting attention. and it was a conversation Truschke never imagined having.Still. Truschke said. she doesn t have plans to stop researching and speaking out about Hindutva. She doesn t know what the future holds — as an academic. she much prefers studying the past to predicting the future. but for now. she knows her scholarship will remain. They want me to not do my job. But how can I possibly do that? How can I possibly change my research interests. or God forbid. soft-peddle things?  she said.  Academics have to tell the truth. ,Politics News

This article is part of HuffPost s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.The politics of abortion aren t especially ambiguous at this point: Most Americans don t want a government ban. And while there s a range of opinion on exactly when it s OK to restrict access. or under what conditions. most Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court s decision overturning Roe v. Wade in June.The evidence is in the polls. in the rejection of that anti-abortion ballot initiative in Kansas. and in the victories for Democrats who support abortion rights in a series of special elections. But for political professionals. the most telling sign may be the way that opponents of abortion rights are acting. They are desperate to shift political conversation away from reproductive rights. When they can t do that. they try to obfuscate either their own position or that of abortion-rights supporters.It s been going on for a while. Here. for example. is an article from August about Republican candidates scrubbing their websites of references to abortion. But this week opponents of abortion have rolled out a new campaign. one that seeks to exploit anxiety over LGBTQ rights and what conservatives have been calling  grooming.  It alleges that a key ballot proposal. in a key state. would let children get gender-affirming care without parental consent.And  alleges  is the right word. because it s based on a far-fetched argument that one prominent legal scholar told me was  absurd. I know about this because it s happening in my home state. Michigan. where reproductive rights are especially central to November s midterm elections. A big reason for that is Proposal 3. which organizers have called the  Reproductive Freedom for All  initiative. The ballot proposal would amend the state constitution by adding language to protect reproductive rights. effectively preventing future lawmakers from passing major abortion restrictions and ― more urgently ― nullifying a 1931 law that makes abortion illegal in nearly all cases. The 1931 law is not currently in force (i.e.. abortion remains legal in Michigan) because lower courts have already blocked prosecutors from bringing cases. pending a ruling from the state Supreme Court on whether the Michigan Constitution already protects abortion. Incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel. both Democrats and both fierce supporters of abortion rights. have said they would use whatever authority they have to prevent its enforcement. But there s no way to know how the state Supreme Court will rule. just as there s no way to know whether Whitmer or Nessel will win reelection next month. Polls were picking up comfortable leads in August and September. Now they are finding closer races for both.Proposal 3 has generally fared well in polls. but a recent one found support down to just 50% amid a burst of advertising by the initiative s opponents. As of last week. those opponents had spent nearly $23 million. while Proposal 3 supporters had spent a little less than $16 million. according to figures collected by the tracking company AdImpact.The advertising isn t so surprising. and if the margins are shrinking that wouldn t be a surprise either. Change frequently makes voters nervous. and the ads try to exploit that by suggesting the amendment would. for example. invalidate existing safety regulations for abortion. The proposal s supporters have disputed that claim ― acknowledging that the amendment. like any other. leaves some rule for judicial interpretation but noting that it explicitly allows for regulations when the state can show a  compelling  interest. Safety regulations would seem to clearly qualify. at least as long as they re really about safety.But that s nothing compared with the new ad. which intersperses images of young children with injectable drugs and argues that Proposal 3 would allow kids to get gender-affirming care without consulting their parents.Here s the full script: This drug blocks a child from going through puberty. It s the first step in gender change therapy. Clinics prescribe this drug in Michigan. If Proposal 3 passes. minors as young as 10 or 11 will be able to receive this prescription without the consent of their parents ― or their parents even knowing it. They call it ‘reproductive freedom.  We call it extreme. Proposal 3 opens up Pandora s box. Only you can close it. Vote no on Proposal 3. The anti-Proposal 3 ad focused only on puberty blockers. But other critics have taken it even further. In an article for The Federalist. a conservative publication. senior legal correspondent Margot Cleveland wrote earlier this month that passing Proposal 3 would  give boys a constitutional right to be castrated and girls the right under Michigan s constitution to be sterilized by way of a hysterectomy or the removal of their ovaries — all without their parents  consent. The argument in the article and the ad rests on two central contentions. One is that the amendment s references to  sterilization  and  infertility care  would extend rights to gender-affirming care. because gender-affirming care can affect fertility. The other is that language applying the amendment s protections to  all individuals  would render age distinctions meaningless. giving minors the right to gender-affirming care without parental involvement. This is not merely a political point. and it is not a worst-case-scenario argument based on how some liberal activist judge or justice might interpret Prop 3.  wrote Cleveland. who is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Notre Dame.  This reality flows from the plain language of Prop 3 and rests on general legal principles of constitutional construction. These are bold claims. And while I don t have the credentials to judge their merits. Leah Litman does.Litman co-hosts the progressive  Strict Scrutiny  podcast and is a law professor at the University of Michigan. That last part is important because she s been paying close attention to this proposition and published a short analysis of it earlier this month.The argument about age. Litman told HuffPost. ignores the fact that courts have long understood that minors don t have the full rights of adults. She cited several examples. including the Second Amendment. which says nothing about age. Even so. she said. judges have ruled repeatedly that the government has more leeway to restrict gun ownership and use by children. Even though the text of those amendments [like the Second Amendment] don t distinguish ― in their language ― between adults and minors. they are still understood to allow states to enact more restrictions over minors rights than adults.  Litman wrote in an e-mail.  That just reflects a basic principle of constitutional law that isn t stated in the words of the amendments: States have greater latitude to restrict the rights of minors than the rights of adults. Litman went on to say that courts have traditionally applied this same logic to reproductive rights. even before the ​​decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization.  States couldn t enact spousal consent requirements. but they could enact parental consent requirements.  she wrote.  That s the regime ― or the protections of rights ― that Proposal 3 reinstates. As for the idea that Proposal 3 protections would somehow extend to gender-affirming care. Litman said. opponents are taking words like  sterilization  out of context. which is not the way judges would interpret them.Litman pointed out that the amendment specifically defines  reproductive freedom  as having  the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy.  Put another way: the measure is about decisions/actions/procedures whose nature or purpose is to affect someone s reproductive capacity or state.  she said.  That doesn t describe gender affirming care. you don t receive gender affirming care in order to alter or bring about a pregnancy. you don t receive gender affirming care for reproductive capacity ― you receive it in order to align your physical sex characteristics with your gender identity. It s not about pregnancies. As an example. Litman noted that the presence of toxins in water could affect pregnancy or lead to sterilization.  No one thinks this amendment says anything about a right to clean drinking water. even though that will have effects on people s fertility.  she said.Eli Savitsimply. flatly. unequivocally false There is absolutely nothing in the text of the Reproductive Freedom for All initiative that mentions or supersedes parental consent.  Savit said during a press conference that the amendment s supporters held Friday. Savit is a Democrat. He s also a former Supreme Court clerk. as is Litman. and he thinks the claims about gender-affirming care are just as egregiously dishonest. This word ‘sterilization  ... is obviously. in the context of matters relating to pregnancy. meant to protect things like tubal ligations or vasectomies. which are personal choices that people should be able to make without interference by the state.  Savit said.  So again. this idea that it has anything to do with gender identity. gender-affirming care is just nowhere to be found in the text the amendment. These are complex arguments. at least in the context of a 30-second advertisement. It s an open question as to how many persuadable. undecided voters who see the TV and video spots will even take the time to think through the issue. or to hear these counterarguments.But that s precisely why these ads and the many millions of dollars behind them can be so effective. They create uncertainty and confusion. which could be enough to defeat a proposal that substantial majorities would otherwise support on the merits.,Politics News

Rudy Giuliani. John Eastman. Mike Flynn. Sidney Powell.

Because the Committee is a total ‘BUST  that has only served to further divide our Country. Trump. despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College. became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully.

Joe Bidenforgive student debtThe budget figures released Friday by the Treasury Department reveal dueling visions about what it means to be financially responsible: Biden can rightly claim that the budget deficit for fiscal 2022 plunged $1.4 trillion from the prior year. critics can use the same report to say that forgiving education loans pushed up the federal debt by roughly $400 billion as the government booked the full expense.DemocratsRepublicans Today we have further proof that we re rebuilding the economy in a responsible way.  Biden said in remarks at the White House.  Republicans in Congress are doubling down on a commitment to explode the deficit again. The annual deficit roughly halved in size because of the end of spending tied to coronavirus pandemic relief and higher tax revenues as more Americans found jobs — an improvement that Biden credits to his policies.Republicans counter that Biden s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan that helped fuel those job gains also helped to trigger high inflation. a key concern of voters going into the midterms. They also want to reverse his recent 15% minimum tax on corporations and expanded funding for the IRS. even though both could reduce forecasted deficits.The government will likely need to raise its legal capacity to borrow and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has signaled that he would push for spending cuts if the GOP gains a majority. You can t just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt.  McCarthy said in an interview this week with Punchbowl News.  There comes a point in time where. okay. we ll provide you more money. but you got to change your current behavior. We re not just going to keep lifting your credit card limit. right? Biden interpreted those comments as a threat to hold U.S. government funding hostage and possibly make it impossible for the government to repay its debt. They will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States. for the first time in our history putting the United States in default unless unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security. Medicare.  Biden said.Administration officials have argued that the forgiveness of student debt will allow borrowers to achieve life milestones such as buying a home and starting a family. Republican lawmakers counter that the forgiveness is a giveaway that disadvantages blue collar workers and those who did not attend college.The monthly report added to those tensions. as much of the cost of debt forgiveness was booked in September. even though the repayment of the loans would have likely occurred over several years.Biden in August announced $10.000 in federal student debt cancellation for those with incomes below $125.000 a year. or households that make less than $250.000 a year. Those who received federal Pell Grants to attend college are eligible for an additional $10.000 in forgiveness.Biden s plan makes 20 million people eligible to get their federal student debt erased entirely.States and groups affiliated with Republicans have filed lawsuits to try to block the forgiveness. A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a suit from six GOP-led states. saying the states lacked legal standing. a decision that the states intend to appeal.Federal finances improved over the past 12 months as the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% from 4.7% in September 2021. The job gains enabled tax revenues to jump 21% from a year ago. while overall spending fell 8% as the government s coronavirus-related aid has faded.In May. the Congressional Budget Office expected the federal deficit to fall in 2023 and then start to rise in the years ahead to $2.25 trillion a decade from now.,Politics News
Maxwell Frost is not your typical candidate.The 25-year-old Democrat running in Florida s 10th Congressional District is likely to be the first Gen Z member of Congress — a term used to refer to those born between 1997 and 2012.But Frost rejects his age is the only thing setting him apart.  I didn t decide to run to be the first Gen Z member of Congress.  he told HuffPost.A survivor of gun violence. Frost worked as National Organizing Director at March for Our Lives — a youth-led movement aimed at ending the gun epidemic in the U.S. created after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland. Florida — for two years before he decided to run for office.But his activism started while he was still in school 10 years ago. following the deadly 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Gun violence. which has been a major focus of his campaign.  is an issue that is solvable that we ve seen the least amount of progress on.  Frost explained.Frost has pledged to be an advocate for gun reform and work to get money into communities across the country to prevent shootings before they even start. if elected. His district is solidly Democratic.Frost said gun regulation is the first step. He explained that the majority of gun crimes in America are born out of the perpetrator s living conditions. noting that people experiencing difficult circumstances often feel that using a gun could help them get ahead. The Florida Democrat believes improving people s standard of living. including access to health care. is key in fighting gun violence. The goal here should be to build a world where people don t feel the need to use a gun to solve their problems in the first place.  Frost. who supports  Medicare for All.  said.won his primary contest in AugustLocal organizers approached Frost in January 2021 to encourage him to run. but he initially rejected their request. attributing his hesitation. in part. to  internalized ageism. Frost. who is Afro-Cuban and was adopted at birth by a musician and a special education teacher. shared the moment that changed his mind. What changed everything for me was connecting with my biological mother. learning about her story. learning about the things she had been through.  he said.writesDuring a phone call with his biological mother. Frost learned he had multiple siblings and that she was forced to give him up because she wasn t able to raise another child.She. along with his adoptive mother who migrated to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1960s. influenced his decision to run. Another contributing factor was his community. which was excited about having a young. progressive candidate to support.But Frost says he can t create change alone.  It s never about one person. It s always about a movement.  Frost told HuffPost.He has donated money to 20 candidates across the country and supported a number of down-ballot candidates in Central Florida. We need to build a Congress that looks like the country. so I want to make sure I m doing everything I can to get good candidates in.  he said.Uber As a young person who just doesn t have a lot of money. I ve been living literally paycheck to paycheck this entire year and at times didn t have money to feed myself.  Frost said.Frost says to have a better democracy. there should be more poor and working-class candidates in the political system.Frost is keen to dispel the myth that young people are disenfranchised with politics. pointing to the fact that Gen Zers are running for office earlier than older generations did. He also expects young voter turnout to continue rising as more Gen Z members reach voting age.according to The Washington Post.Washington Post/ABC News poll Frost said his organizing at March for Our Lives taught him  young people want something to vote for. not against.  adding that many campaigns don t even bother to reach out to voters of his generation.He hopes his campaign. which is built on a message of love. will help inspire voters to turn out to the polls. Love. he said. is what connects his legislative priorities for office: ending gun violence. protecting U.S. democracy by enacting bold election reform and addressing the climate crisis. When you love somebody. you want them to have health care. housing. you want them to be safe. free of gun violence.  he said.ABC News reported citing local officials Just because you re poor. just because you re Black. just because you re Latino does not mean you should live in a place where you have a higher percent chance of dying in a hurricane or losing everything that you own.  he told HuffPost.He emphasized the importance of building climate-friendly infrastructure in Florida. warning.  there will be another hurricane. and it will be bad.  I don t like to be an alarmist. But. I mean. this is an existential problem.  he said.If elected. Frost will join the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Frost said he hasn t yet committed to joining any other groups. including the  Squad.  a group of young progressive lawmakers in the House.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who made historyAOC is part of the reason why I decided to run. I think her election really gave permission to young people to do it.  he said.slept  What s more noble than that?  he asked.Barack Obama Playing music. listening to music. going to concerts is just a huge part of my life.  he said.Music. though. is not a self-care ritual for Frost. It is also a big part of his campaign.Last week. his campaign rented a flatbed truck for Orlando Pride and staged a mobile concert. He played the drums. Music was also a way of bonding with his father. His dad. who is also a musician. was the one to first introduce him to the art and buy him a drum set.Frost recalls his dad reassuring him when he cried to music for the first time.

implosion of Liz Truss  historically short-lived governmentnew prime minister in placecost of groceries. fuel and other basicsRolling strikesrecession is loomingfor a polarizing figureTruss quit on Thursday after a turbulent 45-day term. conceding that she could not deliver on her tax-cutting economic package. which she had to abandon after it cause turmoil in financial markets.In the race to replace her. former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt are among the favorites — along with Johnson. who still faces an inquiry into whether he lied to Parliament while in office that could lead to his suspension as a lawmaker.Despite his troubles. Johnson is still adored by some Conservatives as a vote winner with a rare common touch who led the party to a big election victory in 2019. He is more popular with the party s grassroots than with lawmakers — and he is reviled by some for the chaos and scandal that marred his term in office. Having a winner in place is what the party needs to survive.  Johnson ally Nadine Dorries told Sky News.But former Conservative leader Michael Howard implored the party not to return to the  psychodrama  of the Johnson era. He s had his chance. and it didn t work.  Howard said. Some Conservative legislators have even threatened to leave the party if Johnson returns as leader.Rob Ford. professor of political science at the University of Manchester. said Conservatives who thought Johnson could solve their problems  don t live in a reality-based community. He warned that the electorate at large has not forgotten Johnson s many scandals — and he no longer has the appeal he once did. We know the public don t like him. he can t govern. he definitely can t unify his party. It will be a disaster. It will fail.  Ford said.Johnson. who remained a lawmaker after stepping down as prime minister. has not said whether he will run. but his allies in Parliament are working to gather support for an  I m Backing Boris  campaign. Johnson is expected to return shortly from a Caribbean vacation.Nominations for a new leader will close on Monday afternoon. and candidates need the signatures of 100 of the 357 Conservative lawmakers. meaning a maximum field of three. Lawmakers will vote to knock out one of those. and will hold an indicative vote on the final two. The party s 172.000 members will then get to decide between the two finalists in an online vote. The new leader is due to be selected by Oct. 28.Sunak. who came second to Truss in a summertime leadership contest. is favored by some as a safe pair of hands to steady the struggling economy. Mordaunt. who came third. is popular with the party s grassroots.Popular Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. who was touted as a possible contender. ruled himself out of the race on Friday.But the wild card is Johnson.He was able to shrug off lapses that would have sunk many politicians. surviving even after he was fined by police for attending one of a series of illegal parties in government buildings while the U.K. was under lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.He finally resigned after one scandal too far — this one involving his appointment of a politician who had been accused of sexual misconduct — sparked an exodus of dozens of members of his government.He left reluctantly. calling the decision to oust him  eccentric  and ending his final appearance in Parliament with the words:  Hasta la vista. baby. brief. disastrous experiment in libertarian economicsHer package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets. drove up the cost of government borrowing and home mortgages. and forced emergency Bank of England intervention. Truss executed a series of U-turns and replaced her Treasury chief but faced rebellion from lawmakers in her party that obliterated her authority.Truss admitted Thursday that  I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. tough economic decisionsThe Conservative turmoil at a time of such high stakes is fueling demands for a national election. Under Britain s parliamentary system. there does not need to be one until the end of 2024. though the government has the power to call one sooner.Currently that looks unlikely. Opinion polls say an election would spell disaster for the Conservatives. with the left-of-center Labour Party winning a large majority.Still. opposition politicians say the recent tumult — and the decision by Truss to rip up many of the policies on which Johnson was elected — means the government lacks democratic legitimacy.Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of presiding over a  revolving door of chaos.  This is doing huge damage to our economy and the reputation of our country.  he said.  We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election — now. ___https://apnews.com/hub/liz-truss,Politics News

Donald TrumpDemocrats He is an authoritarian.  said Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  If he were to become president. Katie bar the door on the continuation of our democracy. After Trump s failed attempt to use violence and the threat of violence to remain in office despite losing his 2020 reelection bid. authoritarian experts warned that it would happen again and that the next one to try could not be counted on to be as inept as Trump.DeSantis. Floridians like Carolina Camps argue. embodies that warning precisely. He s smarter. He s ideological. He s better educated. And he s competent.  said Camps. the president of the nonpartisan group Cuban American Women Supporting Democracy.  That scares us to death. Neither DeSantis  campaign nor his governor s office staff responded to HuffPost queries on this topic.DeSantis. like most politicians of both parties. criticized Trump s mob on Jan. 6. 2021.  Violence or rioting of any kind is unacceptable and the perpetrators must face the full weight of the law. The Capitol Police do an admirable job and I thank them for their hard work.  he said in a statement at the time.Yet DeSantis has never criticized Trump s repeated lies about a  stolen  election that led to that day. nor Trump s active encouragement on Jan. 6 itself. including a social media post chastising his own vice president for refusing to join Trump s effort to overturn the election that was followed within minutes by his followers surging past police lines and into the Capitol building.On the one-year anniversary of the attack. DeSantis instead rebuked the news media and Democrats for focusing on investigations into Trump s central role in efforts to overturn the election and remain in office. They are going to take this and milk this for anything they could to try to be able to smear anyone who ever supported Donald Trump.  DeSantis said at a January news conference.  And it s an insult to people when you say it s an ‘insurrection  and then. a year later. nobody has been charged with that. Republicans Before around 2021 he was still a pretty basic-issue GOPer. Conservative. to be sure. but not an edge-case loon.  said Rick Wilson. a longtime Republican consultant who broke with the party when it fell under Trump s sway.  The fashionability of election denialism has skyrocketed since then. Unlike Trump. who famously avoided going to Vietnam because of bone spurs and who had never taken an oath to anything until the day he stood on the Capitol steps at his inauguration. DeSantis swore to defend the Constitution as a judge advocate general Navy officer when he deployed to Iraq for a year.David Jolly. a former GOP congressman from Tampa. said progressives too often conflate policy positions they oppose — on abortion. for example — with a disregard for democracy itself. And DeSantis. while pushing the boundaries of laws. appears to still abide by them.‘find  votesDeSantis. who turned 44 last month. was a political novice in 2012 when he ran for Congress in a safe GOP district in the wealthy suburbs of Jacksonville. He soon became a Fox News favorite. attacking the Barack Obama White House and Democrats generally. before parlaying that into a run for governor in 2018.A timely endorsement from then-President Trump let him romp to the GOP nomination but was likely a drag that November. when he barely squeaked past Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum. who was under FBI investigation for corruption.After winning office. DeSantis for the first year moderated both his tone and his policies. He backed a pardon for the Groveland Four. the African American men who in 1949 were wrongly convicted of raping a white woman and whose families have been seeking to clear their names ever since. He followed through on a commitment to increase funding to restore the Everglades. He even vetoed a bill that prevented counties and cities from banning plastic straws. back when the Trump base was obsessed with that issue.But a year into his term came COVID-19. and with the virus came a snap back to his old Fox News self. As Trump began to downplay the disease. so did DeSantis. and he — using the exact opposite justification as he had with the plastic straw bans — fought cities and counties that were trying to impose restrictions on indoor businesses to slow down transmission.Then. when COVID-19 vaccines first became available. DeSantis aggressively pushed them among those eligible — at the start. just first responders and the elderly. He set up immunization clinics around the state and made numerous personal visits. But as anti-vaccine voices began dominating the Trump voter base. DeSantis backed off his efforts. largely shutting down the newly created vaccination infrastructure as the shots became generally available to more age groups.potentially preventable deaths in FloridaIronically. those tens of thousands of deaths do not appear to have hurt DeSantis  standing in his state. with voters appearing to have accepted that trade-off for reopening businesses and schools quickly. He continues to brag about his administration s choice and calls the disease expert who led the country through the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci. a  little elf  who should be chucked  across the Potomac  River. We were right. and they were wrong.  he likes to claim.With the COVID-19 battles largely behind him this year. DeSantis then moved to push through base-pleasing bills. One bans teachers from mentioning sexual orientation in grades K-3. Another punishes The Walt Disney Co. for criticizing legislation commonly known as the  don t say gay  law by eliminating the company s ability to tax itself for capital improvement projects — even though the legislation will. as passed. raise property tax bills in the two affected counties by as much as thousands of dollars per year.More recently. DeSantis suspended the independently elected state attorney of Hillsborough County for saying he would not prosecute people under Florida s recently imposed 15-week abortion law. The governor directed his newly created election police to arrest 20 ex-felons for voting. three quarters of whom are Black. even though local officials had allowed them to register. And he spent taxpayer money to charter planes and trick Venezuelan asylum-seekers with false offers of housing and jobs into traveling to Martha s Vineyard. while also alerting Fox News so it could exclusively film their arrival in the Massachusetts vacation enclave.And over the past year. he has adopted the lexicon of Trump s followers who continue lying about the 2020 election results. calling President Joe Biden administration s a  regime  to suggest it is illegitimate while gleefully joining in with the  Let s Go Brandon  insult — a euphemism for  fuck Joe Biden. All the while. DeSantis boasts about building up a multibillion-dollar budget surplus but neglects to mention that much of those riches are thanks to federal relief money. which he consistently has criticized. Indeed. the $1.000 bonuses he has been handing out to the state s first responders were paid entirely through the American Rescue Plan — Biden s COVID-19 relief bill. which DeSantis has called wasteful and  Washington at its worst.  The level of hypocrisy is phenomenal.  said Andrew Warren. the Hillsborough County prosecutor who is now suing in federal court to get his job back. He pointed out that a number of laws DeSantis continues to brag about — criminalizing protests. regulating social media companies and banning critical race theory in schools and businesses — have already been blocked by courts as unconstitutional. It s like watching a coach brag about how well he did in the first half. but not point out that he lost the game.  Warren said.Yet despite all the maneuvering to  out-Trump  the man who helped make him governor. it is not clear that DeSantis can become the GOP nominee for president in 2024.price listDeSantis could well start the new year with $100 million on hand — possibly more than even Trump.Working against him. though. are the all-but-certain negative consequences coming due for his various base-play tactics over the past two years.Warren could easily prevail in his federal lawsuit to get his job back in Tampa. Similarly. those arrested by DeSantis  election police are in good position for exoneration. given that elections officials permitted them to vote by letting them register and issuing them voter ID cards.In the case of his law to punish Disney. the 2 million residents and business owners in Orange and Osceola counties will see their property taxes and rents increase substantially — unless DeSantis and the GOP legislature back down and either modify or repeal the measure by June.His Martha s Vineyard stunt. paid for using interest generated from federal COVID-19 relief money. is meanwhile under criminal investigation in Texas and facing an audit by the U.S. Treasury s inspector general.And DeSantis  biggest headache of all is likely to be an acute worsening of the state s property insurance crisis following the tens of billions of dollars of damage left by Hurricane Ian. His 2022 legislation that gave insurers access to another $2 billion in taxpayer-funded reinsurance did nothing to solve the structural problems of underwriting against tropical storms in a state vulnerable to climate change. and premiums are certain to rise dramatically.his coup attemptOutside a Hilton hotel ballroom at the Palm Beach International Airport. where the county Republican executive committee scheduled its final gathering before the November midterms. DeSantis is wildly popular — in his current job. I don t think he s ready for the presidency.  said Mary Kelly. a 77-year-old retiree and committeewoman from Lake Worth who attended wearing a denim jacket adorned with every manner of Trump paraphernalia imaginable. She said she believes that DeSantis and Trump will work out some arrangement between them so that DeSantis can run after another Trump term. If they don t. and DeSantis runs against Trump:  I ll vote against him. Maria Korynsel. a committeewoman from North Palm Beach. said DeSantis isn t thinking about running and that she would absolutely vote for Trump if the two ran against each other. regardless of whether Trump has been arrested by then. Even if he was wearing orange. locked up in jail over here or up in D.C.. I ll still vote for him.  she said. pointing to a nearby county detention center.And that willingness to continue backing Trump no matter his behavior. and DeSantis  willingness to aggressively court those same supporters. make some observers worry that traditional Republicans have too much faith that DeSantis  military background and education will prevent him from mimicking Trump s post-election behavior. The fact that we re even asking that question shows how dysfunctional and dangerous our politics have become.  Warren said.  The idea that because he went to Harvard and Yale. that he knows better? Well. he certainly should know better. Mac Stipanovich. who served as chief of staff to former GOP Gov. Bob Martinez and later advised Jeb Bush s political campaigns in Florida. said Trump has set a scary precedent. which has been made all the more frightening by the failure of the party to punish him for it. He certainly has no qualms about undermining public confidence in the integrity of the election process. which is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. in furtherance of his personal ambition.  Stipanovich said. adding that he fears that DeSantis has seen what Trump did and so far has gotten away with and will try the same thing. To do what Trump did de novo requires a special kind of malignant chutzpah that I am not sure DeSantis would have had at that time. which was … before he went totally off the rails.  Stipanovich said. referring to 2020.  Bottom line: Then? Probably not. Now? Absolutely. ,Politics News

Though Raffensperger says it was clear Graham was suggesting he throw out ballots. Graham holds that he simply called him to ask how the process worked and to  protect the integrity of mail-in voting.

More than 30 House Republicans introduced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit the use of federal funds for  sexually-oriented  materials for children under the age of 10 — effectively nationalizing and broadening the scope of Florida s  Don t Say Gay  billthat has led teachers to remove LGBTQ-friendly material from classroomsThe bill. called the  Stop the Sexualization of Children Act of 2022.  defines  sexually-oriented material  as  any depiction. description. or simulation of sexual activity. any lewd or lascivious depiction or description of human genitals. or any topic involving gender identity. gender dysphoria. transgenderism. sexual orientation. or related subjects.  If passed. the legislation would affect all federally funded facilities and programs. including public libraries. federally funded schools. military bases and hospitals. This would include prohibiting schools and libraries from providing sex education or books that include LGBTQ topics to children under 10.  This bill serves no other purpose than to spread lies in an attempt to erase LGBTQ people. but we will not be erased.  Sarah Kate Ellis. president and CEO of GLAAD. told HuffPost.  Regardless of its chances of passage. which seem low. the damage is already done. A majority of LGBTQ youth say that anti-LGBTQ political conversations. including proposed bans on classroom materials that are relevant to them. negatively impact their mental health. according to a recent study by the Trevor Project. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 in 4 LGBTQ youth attempted suicide last year.  We need leaders who want to solve real problems. not bully innocent kids.  said Ellis.Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.). who introduced the bill. described it as  commonsense.  claiming that Democrats are on a  misguided crusade  to expose children to  sexual imagery and radical gender ideology.  No federal tax dollars should go to any federal. state. or local government agencies. or private organizations that intentionally expose children under 10 years of age to sexually explicit material.  he said in a statement on Tuesday.Some LGBTQ advocates and critics of the bill are calling the legislation a national version of Florida s  Parental Rights in Education  law. commonly known as the  Don t Say Gay  bill. which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed in March.Similar to the Florida law. Johnson s bill could lead to parents suing teachers of all grades at schools that use federal dollars over what the bill defines as  sexually-oriented  materials or programs for children.Ellis says it s tough that this legislation was introduced just days before Spirit Day. a day for LGBTQ youth to celebrate their increasing visibility across the country and speak out against bullying. Instead of joining the rising tide of acceptance and bipartisan support for LGBTQ people. these extremist politicians are trying to score political points and propose a bill filled with misinformation with the futile attempt of smearing and erasing who we are.

As the Federal Reserve fights rising prices. its efforts will be felt not just by borrowers and bond traders but also pretty much anyone who works for a living.The central bank has been raising interest rates. making money more expensive to borrow. in a bid to slow down the whole economy so people don t spend so much. That way. businesses will offer lower prices.Part of the solution involves what Fed Chair Jerome Powell calls  softening of labor market conditions.  That softening. as Powell and his colleagues envision. will involve higher unemployment in the coming year. But Fed officials speak in abstractions. discussing supply and demand or the importance of righting imbalances between the two. while avoiding talk about the material consequences for workers. The language that s used to talk about monetary policy is almost designed to make it less clear what actually is at stake and what the real goals are.  said J.W. Mason. an associate professor of economics at the City University of New York s John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Powell has acknowledged that there will be some  pain  in the Fed s campaign against inflation. maybe to the point of recession. But even workers who stay employed will feel the impact of increased interest rates. The only way in which higher interest rates reduce inflation is by raising unemployment and thereby inducing workers to accept lower wages.  Mason said.fastest pace in more than two decadesThe nominal wage growth occurred amid an economywide mismatch between supply and demand that economists say resulted from supply problems. such as COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine. and also strong pandemic relief policies.The Fed can t do anything about the supply issues. but Powell has said it will keep pushing down on demand until inflation abates. So far. the Fed s historically rapid rate increases this year haven t done the trick. with overall inflation still flying high at 8.2% as of September. while unemployment remains at a historically low 3.5%.The Fed s policymakers have said they expect unemployment to rise to 4.4% next year as a result of their actions. implying that millions of additional workers could face unemployment. Increasing the size of the jobless population would likely mean that more people would be willing to work for less pay.Powell has suggested that workers are too strong right now. describing the current power dynamic as out of whack with what the Fed would consider a better balance between bosses and employees.  You have two job vacancies. essentially. for every person actively seeking a job. and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating.  Powell said at a press conference in June. With a more  normal  ratio of job seekers to openings. Powell said.  You would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases. real wage increases. but at a level that s consistent with 2% inflation. Powell has outlined a  soft landing  scenario in which businesses cut the record supply of job openings without losing too many actual jobs. So far. the strategy could be working. since the number of openings fell by a record 1 million in August. The rapid decline in openings could also be a signal that the Fed s rate increases are working better than expected. and that it should wait to do more.The ultimate magnitude of job losses. Powell said last month. will depend partly  on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down. Mason doubts that lower wage growth is actually necessary for lower inflation. since he does not think higher wages cause higher prices. For one thing. companies paying increased wages could simply accept lower profits instead of hiking prices. But corporations have been jacking up prices while raking in record profits.a speech this month The return of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures in some consumer goods. considering that gross retail margins are about 30 percent of total sales dollars overall.  said Brainard. according to a transcript of her remarks.Some Democrats in Congress have talked about imposing price controls or taxing windfall corporate profits. but for the most part lawmakers have ceded the inflation fight entirely to the Fed.

votersNone of the proposals would force immediate changes inside the states  prisons. though they could lead to legal challenges related to how they use prison labor. a lasting imprint of slavery s legacy on the entire United States.a national push13th Amendment The idea that you could ever finish the sentence ‘slavery s okay when ...   has to rip out your soul. and I think it s what makes this a fight that ignores political lines and brings us together. because it feels so clear.  said Bianca Tylek. executive director of Worth Rises. a criminal justice advocacy group pushing to remove the amendment s convict labor clause.Nearly 20 states have constitutions that include language permitting slavery and involuntary servitude as criminal punishments. In 2018. Colorado was the first to remove the language from its founding frameworks by ballot measure. followed by Nebraska and Utah two years later.This November. versions of the question go before voters in Alabama. Louisiana. Oregon. Tennessee and Vermont.Sen. Raumesh Akbari. a Democrat from Memphis. was shocked when a fellow lawmaker told her about the slavery exception in the Tennessee Constitution and immediately began working to replace the language. When I found out that this exception existed. I thought. ‘We have got to fix this and we ve got to fix this right away.   she said.  Our constitution should reflect the values and the beliefs of our state. Constitutions require lengthy and technically tricky steps before they can be tweaked. Akbari first proposed changes in 2019. the GOP-dominant General Assembly then had to pass the changes by a majority vote in one two-year legislative period and then pass it again with at least two-thirds approval in the next. The amendment could then go on the ballot in the year of the next gubernatorial election.Akbari also had to work with the state Department of Correction to ensure that inmate labor wouldn t be prohibited under her proposal.The proposed language going before Tennessean voters more clearly distinguishes between the two:  Slavery and involuntary servitude are forever prohibited. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an inmate from working when the inmate has been duly convicted of a crime.  We understand that those who are incarcerated cannot be forced to work without pay. but we should not create a situation where they won t be able to work at all.  Akbari said.Similar concerns over the financial impact of prison labor led California s Democratic-led Legislature to reject an amendment eliminating indentured servitude as a possible punishment for crime after Gov. Gavin Newsom s administration predicted it could require the state to pay billions of dollars at minimum wage to prison inmates.former Confederate states after the Civil Warrestrictive measures. known as the  Black codes Fast-forward to today: Many incarcerated workers make pennies on the dollar. which isn t expected to change if the proposals succeed. Inmates who refuse to work may be denied phone calls or visits with family. punished with solitary confinement and even be denied parole.Alabama is asking voters to delete all racist language from its constitution and to remove and replace a section on convict labor that s similar to what Tennessee has had in its constitution.Vermont often boasts of being the first state in the nation to ban slavery in 1777. but its constitution still allows involuntary servitude in a handful of circumstances. Its proposed change would replace the current exception clause with language saying  slavery and involuntary servitude are forever prohibited in this State. Oregon s proposed change repeals its exception clause while adding language allowing a court or probation or parole agency to order alternatives to incarceration as part of sentencing.Louisiana is the only state so far to have its proposed amendment draw organized opposition. over concerns that the replacement language may make matters worse. Even one of its original sponsors has second thoughts — Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate last week that he s urging voters to reject it.The nonprofit Council for a Better Louisiana warned that the wording could technically permit slavery again. as well as continue involuntary servitude.Louisiana s Constitution now says:  Slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited. except in the latter case as punishment for a crime.  The amendment would change that to:  Slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited. (but this) does not apply to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice.  This amendment is an example of why it is so important to get the language right when presenting constitutional amendments to voters.  the nonprofit group said in a statement urging voters to choose  No  and lawmakers to try again. pointing to Tennessee s ballot language as a possible template.Supporters of the amendment say such criticisms are part of a campaign to keep exception clauses in place. If this doesn t pass. it will be used as a weapon against us.  said Max Parthas. state operations director for the Abolish Slavery National Network.The question stands as a reminder of how slavery continues to bedevil Americans. and Parthas says that s reason enough to vote yes. We ve never seen a single day in the United States where slavery was not legal.  he said.  We want to see what that looks like and I think that s worth it. ,Politics News
The office of the Arizona secretary of state has referred a report of voter intimidation to the state s attorney general s office and the U.S. Department of Justice.A voter claimed to have been  approached and followed by a group of individuals  while trying to drop off a ballot at an early-voting drop box Monday. according to the office. Local outlet ABC15 first reported the complaint Wednesday. and a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost that the DOJ had received the referral.The report came from Maricopa County. Arizona ― home to Phoenix and the majority of the state s residents ― and. specifically. a drop box outside the Juvenile Justice Center in the city of Mesa.The report follows months of growing conspiracy theories fostered by the movie  2000 Mules.  which alleges. without evidence. that a network of thousands of  mules  ― slang for people thought to be  harvesting  or  trafficking  ballots illegally ― swung the 2020 election by working with unidentified left-wing groups to smuggle fraudulent votes for Joe Biden into the official count via drop boxes. The film has been endorsed by major Republican politicians and has inspired vigilante drop-box  stakeouts  across the country.It wasn t immediately clear who was behind the alleged intimidation in Mesa. But a right-wing group. Clean Elections USA. has had teams of people actively monitoring drop boxes in Arizona for several days. We are actually making a difference.  the group s founder. Melody Jennings. told former top Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon on Monday.  We are actually seeing mules be intimidated from doing their thievery. We re not intimidating voters. But the mules do not want to be caught on film. and that s what we re doing. We re catching them on telescopic film. We can zoom right in. We can get your face. So we ve got you. During a separate appearance on Bannon s show this week. Jennings claimed that her group has  thousands  of volunteers. and that they are  geotracking  people they suspect of breaking the law.Jennings told HuffPost that  the individual everyone is referring to [in Maricopa County] is not in any way associated with Clean Elections USA and never has been. It was an individual. not a group. statementTruth SocialFor days. Jennings has posted photos of apparent drop-box surveillance efforts. updating her online followers on her group s work. On Sunday. she posted a picture of a sedan near a drop box that appeared to have an obscured license plate.On Monday.

Pulled ballots out of his shirt. I need people there tonight to help my people. Lots of you! 75 ft away from box. post up opposite so we see both sides. Someone get tags. No talking to them. Do NOT GO INSIDE 75 ft! They are trying to get us to engage them. Do not do it!  She included an address below her post that matches that of the drop box in Mesa. Seth Keshel. a popular influencer among those who believe Trump s lies about a stolen 2020 election. responded After 2020. this should be a capital offense.  In another post Monday. Jennings called on supporters to observe the drop boxes in Mesa and Phoenix  right now.

Despite repeated requests. TTV never did provide the information it purported to have in its possession.  the letter from Brnovich s office reads. The Georgia secretary of state s office similarly told HuffPost that True the Vote had not responded to a subpoena in that state.Nonetheless. bitter after Biden s 2020 win in Arizona. many Republicans there have enthusiastically promoted  2000 Mules. The state s Republican nominee for governor. Kari Lake. has claimed the movie shows how the elections were  corrupt  and  rotten.  We want people to be arrested. prosecuted and thrown in jail.  Lake said. And after a May legislative hearing with Catherine Engelbrecht — a co-executive producer of  2000 Mules  and True the Vote s founder — state Sen. Kelly Townsend (R) said she had been  pleased to hear about all you vigilantes out there that want to camp out at these drop boxes.   We re going to be out there. we re going to have hidden trail cameras. we re going to have people parked out there watching you. and they re going to follow you to your car and get your license plate.  Townsend said.Maricopa County officials have condemned the drop-box vigilantism.  We have folks that are approaching our elections workers as they go into the site. they re taking pictures of them.  Bill Gates (R). the chair of the county s board of supervisors. said at a meeting Wednesday.  They re harassing people. They re not helping further the interests of democracy.  Any attempt to deter. intimidate a lawful voter is unlawful. should be immediately reported. please to us. but also law enforcement.  Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer (R) said at a press conference last week. according to ABC15. Richer also noted that there had been reports of people in the vicinity of the same Mesa drop box at the heart of Monday s report.,Politics News
A Republican super PAC supporting Mehmet Oz s Senate campaign has spent $1.5 million to air two TV advertisements aiming to discredit Democratic opponent John Fetterman in the eyes of Black voters.The ads. funded by the Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund. feature two Black Pennsylvania voters arguing that a 2013 incident in which Fetterman pursued an unarmed Black jogger is disqualifying. (Fetterman. who was armed with a shotgun. said he was responding to hearing gunshots and did not see the man s skin color until later on.) My message to Black voters: Do your homework about John Fetterman.  says a woman identified as Janice H. in the spot. titled  No WayThe ad does not tell us anything about Janice s political or professional background. But Janice H. is Janice Hollis. an evangelical minister and media consultant who has been involved in conservative politics for years.Hollis was active in a coalition of conservative Black ministers that criticized then-President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage in 2012. and that later rebuked the Congressional Black Caucus for engaging in what the clergy called the CBC s  sophomoric  protest during then-President Donald Trump s State of the Union address in 2018. (Members of the CBC had worn kente cloth to the speech.)Her byline also appears on an op-ed endorsing Mitt Romney s presidential run in 2012 that cast doubt on whether Obama was born in the United States. We have a sitting president whose religion is questioned. whose nationality is questioned. whose passport is questioned. whose economic theory is questioned. whose so-called apology tour is questioned. and whose policies governing the fate of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi is questioned.  said the op-ed. which appeared in Christian Newswire.  There is a lot we do not know about him. Hollis told HuffPost that she did not author the op-ed. she never signed off on having it attributed to her. and she was furious with the person who solicited her participation in it. I did not like a lot of the things that President Obama stood for.  Hollis told HuffPost.  However. as a Black person. was I happy to see him be elected? Yeah. it represents progress in our country. Referring to the insinuation that Obama might not be a U.S. citizen. she added.  They were trying to stir up something racial and it was a very cheap shot. In addition. the Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund s second television ad.  We Do Too features a Black Pennsylvania voter identified as  Melvin J.  Melvin J.  is Melvin Prince Johnakin. head of an economic development corporation in Philadelphia. In 2020. Johnakin ran as an independent write-in candidate against Rep. Dwight Evans (D) in Pennsylvania s 3rd Congressional District after failing to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot as a Republican. (An effort to run for the seat as a Democrat likewise collapsed following a challenge to his eligibility.)In an interview with the Philly Leader. Johnakin said he had  always  been a Republican and made an impassioned case for Black Philadelphians to vote for then-President Donald Trump. whom he said  seems like an awesome guy.  It d be foolish for anyone in this area to vote for anyone but Trump.  he said.He is now listed as public relations director for the American Real Voice PAC. which supported  America First policies  and candidates who advocated for those policies. The group s media gallery includes photos of members posing with Doug Mastriano. Pennsylvania s far-right Republican gubernatorial candidate.It is not uncommon for candidates to imply that seasoned activists who appear in their advertisements are simply ordinary people supporting their bids.What makes Hollis and Johnakin s participation more notable is that it is part of a pattern of Oz and his allies employing professional Republicans and conservatives to claim he is making inroads with Black voters.In late September. Oz s campaign held a panel discussion on violent crime in northwest Philadelphia where he spoke empathetically with local resident Sheila Armstrong as she discussed losing her brother and nephew in shootings.Some of the reporting initially failed to note that Oz s campaign has employed Armstrong. making it seem instead as though she were a neighborhood resident without any ties to Oz.Hollis claimed that she was unaware of the name of the group behind the TV ad. telling HuffPost that she had done it at the behest of a friend. She also said that while she is conservative. she is  not enamored with either party.  and that she has advised Democratic candidates as well.Hollis even implied that she is leaning against voting for Mastriano. I don t think he has it within him to be … open  to different perspectives. she said.Asked for comment about the choice of two individuals with a history of professional work or activism in Republican politics. Matt Brooks. executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. dismissed the idea that their backgrounds are relevant. The important thing here is these are REAL voters and leaders in the African American community who participated voluntarily and were not compensated in any manner.  he wrote in an email.,Politics News

After Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential race. he and his allies flooded the zone with vicious lies about a stolen election. Implicitly and sometimes explicitly. they blamed thousands of low-level election workers in the supposed plot to deliver Joe Biden an unearned victory. Poll workers and others who do the largely thankless work of administering elections subsequently faced threats and harassment. and many chose to leave the field. ceding ground to well-organized right-wing efforts to train thousands of volunteer observers and paid election workers. Taken together. election officials around the country are now bracing for a potential problem that would have seemed outlandish just a few years ago: so-called  insider threats  to the midterm voting process. Some election experts fear that individuals seeking to produce evidence of widespread voter fraud — even when it doesn t exist — could end up in sensitive election roles. allowing them to stir chaos with claims of fraud or wrongdoing.Officials in several states. including Colorado. North Carolina. Arizona and Nevada. have reported unusually aggressive poll watcher activity so far in primary elections this year. Reuters reportedPoll watchers have made comments about  fraudulent elections.  attempted to take photographs of voting equipment and looked at private voter data. according to the report.As early general election voting gets underway around the country. some administrators are planning for further disruptions.  We are expecting that election deniers will try to interfere with this or future elections to create a veneer of chaos that would give canvassers an excuse — albeit a false one — to refuse to certify the election.  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D). who is herself running against election denier Kristina Karamo this year. told HuffPost in a statement. Benson said that while courts would ultimately step in in such an instance.  it will enable election deniers to claim the unwillingness to certify demonstrates the illegitimacy of the election and thereby undermine the ability of the elected to govern.  Jennifer Morrell. a former elections official in Utah and Colorado and co-founder of The Elections Group. said she s worked with elections officials across the country who are feeling a sense of dread about how the next few weeks may unfold. There s been growing concern about reports of a well-organized. well-funded campaign to recruit individuals sympathetic to claims of election fraud and train them to be precinct committeemen. election judges. poll workers. poll watchers and unofficial observers.  Morrell said.  The concern is. whether it s one polling location or many. it s just going to create chaos. If they re told that everything they see is a problem. even if it s a normal part of election operations or an innocent mistake. there s a potential to create a feeling of chaos. or problems where there aren t any ... which would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election. The offices that power America s elections are in the middle of a historicbraindrain. Since 2020. more than half of Pennsylvania counties have lost one of their top elections officials. part of a wave of resignations and retirements representing more than 1.000 years of experience and institutional memory. the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Sunday. The paper attributed the loss to low pay and the expanded workload of increased mail-in voting. but also the threats and harassment from Pennsylvanians who distrusted the 2020 election results.Between resignations and scheduled retirements. Kentucky is set to lose 23 county clerks this year. Secretary of State Michael Adams said this week. compared to just two who stepped aside in 2020. In Gillespie County. Texas. a county elections administrator and her two deputies resigned all at once in August. leaving the county office unstaffed. after years of combating local election conspiracy theories. Votebeat reported.Some counties  staffing choices are outright alarming: In May. a right-wing activist who was present on restricted Capitol grounds on Jan. 6. 2021. was hired as an elections trainer and poll worker recruiter by the clerk s office in Macomb County. Michigan. which is the state s third most populous and includes part of the Detroit area. The new trainer. Genevieve Peters. hasn t agreed to media outlets  interview requests. but she told Talking Points Memo in February last year that she believed the 2020 election was  stolen  and  fraudulent.  and estimated she was one of roughly 300 people with a VIP pass to Trump s speech the morning of the attack on the U.S. Capitol.Peters. who acknowledged organizing a bus trip for the event. said she obtained the VIP pass through  an organization that I am. you know. connected with somehow.  but declined to specify further. We now have a tyrannical government. and I will not stand for a tyrannical government.  Peters said at the time while condemning the violence on Jan. 6. 2021. She added separately:  We re sick and tired of not being able to trust our elected officials or our elections. And trust me. this is far from over. Macomb County Clerk Anthony Forlini (R) told HuffPost that Peters went through a  rigorous interview and selection process  and said he was happy with her  professionalism and skill level.  He added:  We have a diversity of employees from many backgrounds all of which I embrace. While Peters didn t return HuffPost s interview request. there s no indication her views of the 2020 election have changed. There is already ample evidence that elected. appointed and seasonal election workers with conspiracies on the brain can wreak havoc — which sometimes amounts to criminal interference. Tina Peters. the Republican clerk in Mesa County. Colorado. currently faces multiple felony charges including identity theft for her alleged attempt to subvert her office s security protocols and sneak an outsider into a sensitive software update session for voting machines. As digital images of Mesa County s election machines circulated at MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell s  Cyber Symposium  last year. Peters announced that state investigators had raided her office. A year later. FBI agents surrounded Lindell s car at a Hardee s drive-thru. presenting a search warrant for his cell phone as part of a broader investigation into the situation in Colorado.withappointed a supervisorallegedlyIn Coffee County. Georgia. a team working with then-Trump legal adviser Sidney Powell accessed voting machines in the elections office the day following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Among those in the room were Cathy Latham. the former county Republican Party chair. and Scott Hall. a bail bondsman who served as a Fulton County Republican poll watcher. In May. the county s former election supervisor. Misty Hampton. told The Washington Post that she d opened her offices to the team. saying she d hoped they could prove  that this election was not done true and correct. Over the summer. commissioners in Otero County. New Mexico — including a convicted Jan. 6 defendant.  Cowboys for Trump  founder Couy Griffin — initially refused to certify election results. citing vague concerns about voting machines. until the state s Supreme Court forced their hand. Griffin. who voted against certification even after the court s order. said his vote was  based on my gut feeling  rather than  facts  or  evidence. Last month. a state judge barred Griffin from holding office  effective immediately.  saying he had violated a section of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits people who ve taken an oath of office from serving if they engage  in insurrection or rebellion. And in Michigan. a group including a right-wing sheriff and the Republican nominee for attorney general got their hands on several machines used in the 2020 election from multiplelocalities across the state. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) referred to the effort as a potential  conspiracy.  and her office successfully petitioned for a special prosecutor to investigate.Morrell. from The Elections Group. said that while elections officials in years past have generally trusted that election workers would come to appreciate and follow the rules that protect against interference. these days. they re worried about breaking through at all.  Election officials are saying. ‘no matter what we do. it doesn t seem to matter what info we give them. how much we answer these records requests or hold public meetings. it just doesn t seem to have an impact.   she said. All of her clients. Morrell added. have voiced some version of a common sentiment:  We re overwhelmed by [public records requests]. we ve lost good people. we re burnt out. worried. don t know what will happen. and are being challenged publicly in new ways. One recent criminal case shows just how challenging this coming election could be. Republican poll watcher James Holkeboer now faces two felony charges after he allegedly put a thumb drive into an electronic poll book computer in Kent County. Michigan. after polls closed on the state s August primary election day. admittedMLive reportedWith openings across the country for seasonal poll workers and more senior election positions. Republican Party officials have been aggressive about holding poll watcher trainings. and GOP legislators across the country have worked to give partisan election observers and challengers more access to the election process. Given that more than half of Republican candidates. as well as 61% of GOP voters. falsely deny or question the results of the last election. there s fertile ground for conspiracy theorists to insert themselves into the mechanics of the voting process.The day before Michigan s August primary. for example. the Wayne County GOP chairwoman encouraged poll workers and observers to  secretly  bring cell phones and pens and paper into polling places. CNN reported. Recordings obtained by the watchdog group Documented show the national Republican Party working with groups who deny the legitimacy of Biden s presidency to train poll workers.At the state level. poll watchers now have expanded legal authority in Texas. where the large 2021 election bill S.B. 1 allows them  free movement  within polling places and makes it a class A misdemeanor for an election official to reject a poll worker. The law also states that. except for penal code violations. poll watchers can t be removed from polling places unless an election judge or clerk personally observes them breaking a rule. It s also now an offense for anyone to take  any action to obstruct the view of a watcher  that might make their observation ineffective. In Iowa. S.F. 413 states that any election official who obstructs or interferes with election observers shall be guilty of third-degree election misconduct.And in North Carolina. a 10-member body appointed by the state s GOP-controlled legislature rejected new rules for partisan poll watchers that would have prohibited the partisans from. among other things. standing close enough to voting booths or ballot tabulators to view marked ballots. The Associated Press later noted one incident in the state. during the May primary. where a poll watcher had  wedged herself between a voter and the machine where the voter was trying to cast his ballot.  requiring an angry intervention over speakerphone from the county s election director. Appearing on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon s show recently. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel emphasized that a federal consent decree that limited the RNC s poll-watching program for decades has now ended. The arrangement. which a judge let expire in 2018. was put in place in 1982 in response to allegations that GOP  ballot security  work had targeted Black and Latino voters. McDaniel said the party had already trained 30.000 poll watchers with more on the way. Then. she stressed that the GOP had corralled the same number of poll workers — which was  maybe more important.  she said. before listing strongholds for Black Democrats.  These are people who will actually be working the polls in Fulton County. in Wayne County. in Milwaukee. in Philly. These are going to be the people that we have submitted that are going to actually be counting the ballots. Later. Bannon referred to 2022 as the most important midterm election since 1862.  We have the unique opportunity to put a crushing death blow at the ballot box on the Democratic Party as a national political institution.  he said.  We must win.  ,Politics News
Marshae Jones was five months pregnant when she was arrested for being shot in the stomach.It was 2019. and Jones got into a fight in the parking lot of a Dollar General just outside of Birmingham. Alabama. It escalated until a woman pulled out a gun and shot her. After being rushed to the hospital. Jones was in stable condition. but the shooting caused her to miscarry.Jones. then 28 with a young daughter. was arrested. A grand jury returned an indictment for felony manslaughter. stating that Jones  intentionally caused the death  of her fetus  by initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant.  She faced 20 years in prison.Jones spent time in jail. and her name and mug shot were splashed across front pages as the case drew national attention. But the charge was eventually dropped. in part because Alabama s manslaughter statute prohibits women from being prosecuted for their pregnancy outcomes. Prosecutors also concluded that pursuing charges against Jones was  not in the best interest of justice. Vesting fetuses with full legal rights would have unintended and unfair consequences for women like Jones. which prosecutors belatedly realized. But such consequences have been a goal of the anti-abortion movement for years. After this summer s Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization. which ended nationwide abortion rights. these efforts could endanger any pregnant person in any state that enacts  fetal personhood  laws.Abortion opponents  stated motivation for these laws is to ensure severe punishment for patients. providers and anyone else who facilitates the end of a pregnancy in a state where the procedure is banned.The battle is playing out most dramatically in Georgia. Less than a month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. the state enacted one of the most extreme abortion restrictions in the country. House Bill 481. or the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act. bans abortion after cardiac electrical activity can be detected. usually around six weeks ― a point at which most people don t yet know they re pregnant. While several states have even more extreme abortion restrictions. including banning abortion from the point of conception. Georgia s includes a uniquely terrifying clause: It recognizes an embryo or fetus as a person after six weeks of pregnancy.The termination. or suspected termination. of a pregnancy after the six-week point could be considered murder under Georgia s law. And although there is an exception for miscarriage in H.B. 481. abortion and miscarriage are medically indistinguishable. This means the law empowers officials to scrutinize. surveil and criminalize not only women seeking abortion care. but also women with wanted pregnancies.Chris Carr. the attorney general of Georgia who is facing a tough reelection battle. has said that he doesn t believe the law can be used to prosecute women for obtaining an abortion. But to many people. the intent of the law is clear — and Republicans. perhaps. are afraid to be honest about its implications. If a woman were to go to another state to seek abortion care. she could still be prosecuted here for conspiracy to commit murder or murder.  state Sen. Jen Jordan. who is challenging Carr as the Democratic nominee for attorney general. told HuffPost.  Medication abortions. in terms of how they present. look exactly like naturally occurring miscarriages. meaning women are going to be investigated for miscarriages. The idea of legally defining a fetus as a person is not new. but it has gained steam in right-wing groups since the fall of Roe ― most recently in Boston. where a so-called men s rights group hosted the  .  Georgia s personhood law may foreshadow a frightening new chapter in the war on choice. It s so important for people to understand just how significant this specific provision is. even apart from the six-week abortion ban.  Jordan said.  This is a wholesale change to who a person is in this state. There s a snowball effect when a state defines a fetus as a human. And while Georgia is the first state to enact a personhood law in a post-Roe world. it s not the first state to legally interpret a fetus as a person.Sharon Bonte was seven months pregnant when she was hit by a car crossing the street in New Hampshire in 1988. She had an emergency cesarean section and her daughter was born with cerebral palsy due to the accident. leaving the child permanently disabled. A New Hampshire court ruled at the time that a fetus can have a cause of action against its mother for prenatal injuries. permitting the infant to sue her mother for negligence. The child s father. Andy Bonte. brought the civil action against his wife. on behalf of his daughter. The infant s attorney successfully argued that a fetus is a person. entitled to the same rights as born children. and won a $1 million judgment.A handful of New Hampshire Supreme Court judges warned about the dangers of recognizing fetal personhood in their dissenting opinion. They concluded that valuing a fetus as a human is an  intrusion into the privacy and physical autonomy rights of women  and holds  profound implications that such a rule of law holds for all women in this state who are. or may become. pregnant.  If fetal personhood were recognized by the government. the judges argued. it would allow the state to  govern such details … as her diet. sleep. exercise. sexual activity. work and living environment. and. of course. nearly every aspect of her health care.  encompassing  the mother s every waking and sleeping moment. These fears are among the reasons why Georgia s abortion ban set off intense criticism across the country when it was first introduced in 2019.  The State of Georgia … recognizes the benefits of providing full legal recognition to an unborn child above the minimum requirements of federal law.  the legislation reads.  It shall be the policy of the State of Georgia to recognize unborn children as natural persons. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R). a dedicated abortion opponent. signed the bill into law in 2019. but it was immediately blocked in state court and later struck down by a federal court because it was unconstitutional under Roe.But now Roe is gone. and the six-week abortion ban. along with its fetal personhood clause. went into effect in July. Though there are federal and state court cases being litigated against the abortion ban. the personhood bill remains in effect with some potentially harrowing consequences for anyone with the capacity for pregnancy in the state. This law is saying that the pregnancy you re carrying after six weeks holds the same amount of value as you do.  said Dr. Nisha Verma. an Atlanta-based abortion provider and OB-GYN.  I m not saying that pregnancy or fetuses don t hold value … but I don t believe that a pregnancy holds more value than the pregnant person. And that s what these laws are saying. By recognizing a six-week embryo as a fully formed human. H.B. 481 is a sharp departure from federal law and most state laws. Federal law allows punishment for violence against a pregnant person that harms a fetus. but there s no federal law that grants embryos or fetuses legal protection independent of the pregnant person.Republican lawmakers did not outline how changing the legal definition of a person would impact the state s civil and criminal codes ― creating a chilling effect where physicians and patients alike don t know which of their actions may be considered illegal. And where state legislators were explicit in the fetal personhood clause. their choices were seemingly arbitrary and random. according to several experts who spoke with HuffPost. The law includes tax exemptions for a fetus. allows pregnant people to file for child support during pregnancy. and includes fetuses in the state population count.The six-week abortion ban does include narrow exceptions. including if the mother s life or health is at risk. as well as exceptions for rape or incest if a police report is filed. The law also includes distinctions around when the state recognizes a fetus as a  natural person.  The fetal personhood clause defines an  unborn child  as  a member of the species Homo sapiens  who  is carried in the womb  after cardiac electrical activity can be detected. This means that personhood does not apply to embryos created through in vitro fertilization or to ectopic pregnancies. which are embryos that implant outside of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies are not viable and are life-threatening to the pregnant person.The personhood clause also clarifies that a person cannot be prosecuted for the outcome of their pregnancy if it s a miscarriage or stillbirth. But. medically. it s impossible to distinguish an illegal abortion after six weeks from a natural miscarriage ― the medical term for which is  spontaneous abortion.  Between 10% and 20% of known pregnancies in the U.S. end in miscarriages. according to the Mayo Clinic. And the frequency of miscarriage ― defined as the unexpected end of a pregnancy before 20 weeks ― is likely a lot higher than that. since many women miscarry before they even know they re pregnant.The Georgia law effectively opens up a Pandora s box of surveillance and criminalization targeting anyone in the state who can become pregnant. The state of Georgia is purporting to amend hundreds of criminal and civil provisions of Georgia law that include the term ‘person  to encompass an in-utero embryo or fetus.  said Alice Wang. a staff attorney from the Center for Reproductive Rights and one of the litigators on the state-level case against the Georgia law. It is unclear how the personhood provision might be applied. and this lack of clarity is by design.  Wang said.  It invites arbitrary and aggressive enforcement by prosecutors and creates a climate of fear and confusion. For example. Georgia allows expectant mothers to claim fetuses as dependents. If a woman miscarries. is that setting her up for tax fraud? Georgia also counts embryos or fetuses past the six-week point as part of the population. If someone miscarries. what are the consequences of reporting inaccurate information to the government?And the list of questions only gets longer when the stakes are higher. If a pregnant woman legally travels out of state to get an abortion past six weeks. will she be arrested for conspiracy to commit murder on her return home? If she travels out of state to get a medication abortion and takes the second dose of abortion pills once back in Georgia. did she commit murder in the eyes of the state? What about the provision that allows child support payments for a fetus? Women are most likely to be murdered by abusive partners during pregnancy ― will this increase the incidence of lethal intimate partner violence if abusive fathers can t pay? And if child support is allowed. can custody disputes begin when a fetus is still in the womb?The answers to many of these questions will ultimately be resolved by the Georgia officials responsible for carrying out the law.When HuffPost posed some of these questions to Kemp s office. a spokesperson for the governor replied with a vague statement. Working closely with the General Assembly. Gov. Kemp has made significant strides in policies that protect life at all stages ― from adoption and foster care reform. to combatting human trafficking and passing the heartbeat bill.  the spokesperson told HuffPost.The statement is similar to much of what Kemp has said on the abortion ban since it became law: little to nothing. The governor has seemed reticent to discuss specifics around the abortion ban. particularly enforcement. despite its central place in his 2019 campaign. And while frustrating. it makes sense: Pushing ever more aggressive anti-abortion policies is a winning strategy for Republicans running in crowded primary fields. But enforcing a fetal personhood law is completely different. Prosecuting women for their pregnancy outcomes. particularly those with wanted pregnancies. is not a winning strategy.Jordan. the Democratic nominee for attorney general. told HuffPost that what was once used as a political football is now a reality that will have dire consequences for Georgians if enforced. If women know about this law and the impact on women all over this state. then they re going to get voted out.  Jordan said of her opponent Carr. as well as Kemp and other Republicans in the state.  You would think that they d be publicly rejoicing about it. and instead they don t want to talk about it. And I understand why. Because the implications are broad and incredibly negative. Carr. who supported H.B. 481. argued that the law is not intended to criminalize pregnant women seeking abortions or those with wanted pregnancies. There is no mechanism under state law to prosecute women for having an abortion. a miscarriage. or an ectopic pregnancy.  said Kara Richardson. a spokesperson for Carr.  Georgia s current criminal abortion code. which has been in effect for decades. makes clear that a pregnant woman cannot be prosecuted for obtaining an abortion. and the LIFE Act makes no change to that. But as the law reads currently. there s not much preventing prosecutors from going after pregnant people in Georgia. Under H.B. 481. prosecutors and law enforcement are able to get the medical records of women so that they can investigate these situations.  Jordan said.Jordan knows the pain of losing a wanted pregnancy. The state senator spoke about her seven miscarriages and one stillbirth in a 2019 floor speech against H.B. 481. A pregnant woman who suffers a miscarriage could be subjected to criminal investigation. indictment. prosecution — long-before a jury is asked to determine whether she intentionally did anything to cause the loss.  Jordan said in her floor speech.  My experience wasn t about abortion. but it is what s at stake here. It s about the fundamental right to privacy of women. When asked if she believes she would have been investigated if this law were in place at the time of her pregnancy losses. she responded:  Absolutely.  It s horrifying to think that when women are dealing with some of the most difficult moments of their lives in terms of losing a child. they have to sit there and think about if law enforcement will look into their records and investigate them or go after their doctor.  she said.  I don t want to live in a state where a woman who gets pregnant not only needs to get a doctor but has to get a lawyer too. Beyond Carr s prerogatives. the application of the law will be left to the discretion of individual district attorneys. often with the help of law enforcement and other county officials. Many Georgia prosecutors publicly stated they will not enforce H.B. 481. but others said they will. Atlanta Journal Constitution found I do not feel that is proper for me. as district attorney. to pick and choose which laws I want to enforce. and I do not do so.  Lookout Mountain District Attorney Chris Arnt told the newspaper in July. adding that he plans to prosecute anyone who violates the law.told the Georgia RecorderAlthough none of Georgia s current DAs appear to have commented specifically on the fetal personhood clause. some in the past have discussed what enforcement would look like.saidThen-acting Cobb County District Attorney John Melvin argued in 2019 that the Georgia law offers  benefits of personhood  to fetuses and that not enforcing the law would be denying those fetuses rights. He also attacked fellow district attorneys who vowed not to enforce the law at the time. likening them to Nazis and racists from the 1960s for not recognizing fetuses as fully human.Neither Leonard nor Melvin is still in office. although the latter is currently the assistant director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. But their extreme views illustrate how a handful of powerful people could instigate an unprecedented overhaul of the state s civil and criminal codes.Given prosecutors like these. women like Jones ― the Alabama mother who miscarried after being shot in the stomach ― would likely stand trial in Georgia today.Some may believe that these possibilities are far-fetched or sound hyperbolic. but every expert HuffPost spoke with said this is the reality the U.S. is barreling toward. I struggle with trying not to be alarmist and making sure I m grounded in reality. but the reality is quite alarming.  said Dana Sussman. acting deputy executive director at National Advocates for Pregnant Women.The Supreme Court overturned Roe and now over a dozen states have near-total abortion bans in effect ― and that number is only expected to grow. People are being denied cancer treatment. lifesaving miscarriage care and access to birth control prescriptions and emergency contraceptives. Although the Supreme Court recently declined to take up the issue of fetal personhood ― a small win for abortion-rights advocates ― the current reality is terrifying. And it only becomes more frightening when looking at how fetal personhood laws have played out in the past.Although Georgia is the first state to enact a fetal personhood law since Roe fell. it s not the first state with a personhood law on the books. Fifteen states had some form of criminal fetal personhood laws in effect before Roe fell this summer. Many. like South Carolina s and Alabama s. center on drug use during pregnancy and have historically been weaponized against the most marginalized. including poor women and people of color. There were over 1.300 criminal fetal personhood cases nationally between 2006 and 2020. according to National Advocates for Pregnant Women.If fetal personhood and abortion bans become one and the same. there will inevitably be prosecutions for terminating pregnancies. experts told HuffPost. If the present reality of pregnancy criminalization and abortion restrictions shows anything. it is that seemingly far-fetched possibilities too easily become reality.  NAPW argued in an August 2022 brief on the current state of fetal personhood in the U.S. Many would scoff at the idea that a pregnant person could be criminalized for falling down the stairs. getting shot in the stomach. or taking prescription medication. Yet those are all real cases.  the brief continues.  We should take all potential implications seriously. recognizing possible future ramifications while also acknowledging the bitter past and present of policing and criminalization of pregnancy. Personhood laws are similar to abortion trigger bans in that they were largely symbolic before Roe fell. Sussman said. And yet rogue prosecutors have weaponized these laws to criminalize hundreds of people since Missouri passed the first fetal personhood law in the country in 1986.It s not hard to see where the U.S. is heading now that Roe s guardrails are gone and prosecutors are free to interpret personhood laws like Georgia s in whatever way they wish. Even though the Georgia law makes exceptions for life endangerment and says the state won t prosecute the pregnant person [for having a miscarriage]. never trust a law that says that.  said Grace Howard. an assistant professor of justice studies at San José State University who is writing a book titled  The Pregnancy Police: Conceiving Crime. Arresting Personhood.  All I have seen in my work is those exceptions being ignored. And they get away with it because they re usually going after folks who don t have a lot of resources to fight back.  Howard said.  As long as they have a cooperative system of cops. prosecutors and judges. they can do whatever they want. ,Politics News

John Fettermannew medical reportletter from his cardiologistpressure Overall. the Lt. Governor is recovering well from his stroke and his health has continued to improve.  wrote Dr. Clifford Chen of Community Family Practice-UPMC in Duquesne. Pennsylvania.  Overall. Lt. Governor Fetterman is well and shows strong commitment to maintaining good fitness and health practices.  Chen concluded.  He has no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office. In the report. Chen said that he examined Fetterman last Friday for a follow-up visit after he began seeing Fetterman as a patient in May. During the visit. Fetterman had  normal  blood pressure and pulse.  normal  strength in his arms and legs. and delivered a  clear  lung exam. Fetterman exercises  routinely  and is capable of  regularly  walking 4-5 miles without any challenges. according to Chen.In addition. Fetterman s speech has  significantly improved  since his first visit with Chen. thanks in part to regular speech therapy sessions. Chen wrote. He spoke intelligently without cognitive deficits.  he added.At the same time. Chen confirmed that Fetterman  continues to exhibit symptoms of an auditory processing disorder which can come across as hearing difficulty.  Occasional words he will ‘miss  which seems like he doesn t hear the word but it is actually not processed properly.  Chen wrote.Fetterman suffered a stroke that was nearly fatal mere days before his landslide win in the Democratic Senate primary on May 17. The day of the primary election. Fetterman underwent surgery to have a pacemaker inserted.In the first doctor s letter that Fetterman released a few weeks later. Fetterman s cardiologist. Dr. Ramesh Chandra. revealed to the public that Fetterman suffers from a chronic heart condition. atrial fibrillation. which caused the stroke. In the course of treating Fetterman. the physician discovered a second heart condition. cardiomyopathy. which makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.Fetterman had visited Chandra for treatment in 2017 when his feet were swollen. Chandra diagnosed Fetterman s atrial fibrillation. the key symptom of which is an irregular heartbeat. at that time. But in the intervening period. Fetterman failed to follow up with Chandra or take the blood thinners that were prescribed. Fetterman has since vowed to listen to medical instructions and maintains a healthier diet.Fetterman spent about three months recovering. He marked his return to the campaign trail with a rally in Erie on Aug. 12.Fetterman has since kept a regular schedule of campaign events and rallies. but he has not made himself available to reporters following his events and provided a limited number of interviews. For in-depth interviews. he relies on closed captioning to ensure that he accurately understands every word that the interviewer is saying.Fetterman also fought publicly with his Republican opponent. Dr. Mehmet Oz. over the number of televised debates and their timing. Oz expressed a willingness to do five debates and wanted them to begin in early September. Fetterman ultimately agreed to one that is due to take place on Oct. 25. Oz and his Republican allies have seized on video clips of Fetterman mangling words during his speeches as evidence that he is unfit for office. But Fetterman has been open about his auditory processing difficulties and attacked Oz. a former cardiac surgeon. for mocking him. (In fact. Oz has largely delegated the task of mocking Fetterman to campaign aides.) I hope you didn t have a doctor in your life making fun of it. laughing at you. telling you that you re not able to do your job. you re not fit to serve.  Fetterman said at a late September rally in Philadelphia.  But unfortunately. I have a doctor in my life making fun of me and saying all of those things. But if we don t do what we have to do and step up. you re going to have that doctor in your life for the next six years. Oz s campaign called the news in Dr. Chen s report  good news.  then pivoted to calling on Fetterman to participate in a second debate and to lengthen the currently scheduled debate to 90 minutes.,Politics News
Hotly contested supreme court elections in Illinois. Michigan. Montana. North Carolina and Ohio are likely to determine the future of abortion rights. voting rights and gerrymandered district maps in those states.In each court. one political party or ideological bloc holds a one-vote majority on the most pressing issues. including abortion and redistricting. Any change in their makeup in the midterms could lead to the protection or elimination of abortion rights in these states. Meanwhile. the fate of legislative redistricting is also at stake in North Carolina and Ohio. as courts are fighting with Republican-run legislatures over highly partisan gerrymanders.Democratic PartyRepublican PartyDemocratsThese judicial majorities are more important than ever since the United States Supreme Court began devolving constitutional issues from federal courts to state courts.In June. the court s conservative supermajority ended federal abortion protections when it overturned Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization decision. By revoking the recognition of a federal right to an abortion. the issue of abortion rights would be  returned to the people and their elected representatives.  Justice Samuel Alito wrote.The decision in Dobbs followed a 2019 decision by the court s conservatives declaring the federal courts off-limits for constitutional claims of partisan gerrymandering. Instead of federal courts.  ​​state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply  to resolve partisan gerrymandering complaints. according to Chief Justice John Roberts.The decisions made state courts the final arbiters of the constitutionality of abortion bans and legislative redistricting. They have already stepped into that role by overseeing divisive redistricting fights and taking on cases examining the role of their state constitutions in granting abortion rights.blocked by state court ordersMeanwhile. legislative district maps in North Carolina and Ohio are operating on a temporary basis after courts rejected maps drawn by each state s Republican-run legislature.These developments have caused Democratic Party groups and their allies to spend more money than in previous years to maintain or establish majorities protecting abortion rights.The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures. is spending money on state judicial races for the first time.The National Democratic Redistricting Committee. a group focused on legislative and judicial races in states. has invested just over $1 million in the judicial races in Michigan. North Carolina and Ohio by funding state-level allies. including state Democratic Party organizations. and through the group s own volunteers.record $50 million election campaign We re super clear that the path to restore. protect and expand abortion access and ultimately abortion equity runs through the states.  said Sarah Standiford. national campaign director at Planned Parenthood Action Fund.  And I think that s now more clear to voters than ever before. The ACLU. which has long defended abortion rights. is also investing in the judicial elections in Kansas. Michigan. Montana. North Carolina and Ohio through its state-level affiliates. Folks are seeing this in a new light since the Dobbs decision leaked and came out in late June.  said J.J. Straight. deputy director of the Liberty Division at the ACLU.  The talking points we heard then is that this should go to the states — and that is where it is now. With three state supreme court seats up for grabs. Ohio could see the biggest swing in terms of partisan control and policy impact.The court is currently embroiled in a fight with the GOP-run state legislature and GOP Gov. Mike DeWine over the legislative maps adopted following the 2020 census. The maps were the first drawn since Ohioans voted in favor of a constitutional amendment aimed at limiting partisan gerrymandering. Despite that amendment. Republicans drew a map heavily biased in their favor.The state supreme court ruled repeatedly. by a 4-3 vote each time. that the GOP-drawn maps violated the constitution s anti-gerrymandering language. Chief Justice Maureen O Connor. a Republican. sided with the court s three Democrats in each instance. But O Connor is retiring and the seat could flip to a Republican who would likely vote differently.The race for the chief justice seat is between current Justices Jennifer Brunner. a Democrat. and Sharon Kennedy. a Republican who voted to uphold the gerrymandered maps.Two Republican-held seats are also up. Justice Pat Fischer. a Republican. faces Democratic appellate Judge Terri Jamison and Justice Pat DeWine. a Republican and the son of the governor who refused to recuse himself from judging his father s chosen legislative map. is being challenged by Democrat Marilyn Zayas. who is also an appeals court judge.Since Ohio s current district maps will only be in effect through the 2024 election. the question of whether the state s Republicans can continue to gerrymander legislative maps in their favor will certainly continue to come before the court.Additionally. the court will certainly rule on the constitutionality of Ohio s ban on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. A lower court temporarily suspended the state s ban as it found it likely that the Ohio Constitution protects the right to an abortion. The case is almost certain to wind up before the state supreme court in the future.From a governor s race to a ballot initiative. practically every election in Michigan this November is about abortion. That is also true of the two state supreme court seats up for grabs in races that are ostensibly nonpartisan. though candidates are chosen by political parties.The Michigan Supreme Court is currently split with four Democrat-backed and three Republican-backed justices. Democrats flipped control of the court in 2020 after picking up two seats. They hope to not only defend their majority but increase it further.Justice Richard Bernstein. who is backed by Democrats. and Republican-backed Justice Brian Zahra are the two incumbents running for reelection in 2022. Challenging them are state Rep. Kyra Harris Bolden. who is backed by Democrats. and appellate lawyer Paul Hudson. who is backed by Republicans. All of the candidates run on the same ballot with the top two vote-getters winning.Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. a Democrat. and abortion rights advocacy groups are behind two separate lawsuits asking the court to invalidate the state s 1931 abortion ban law. That law is temporarily suspended as the state courts review its constitutionality.This may all become moot if Michigan voters approve a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. All polls show that the initiative is headed toward passage. If Republicans win both seats and flip control. however. they could potentially work to limit the initiative or overturn it altogether.electing the first Black womanAside from Ohio. few states can claim the kind of divisive and partisan recent battles between a state judiciary and state legislature that North Carolina can.Most recently. the North Carolina Supreme Court. which is split with four Democrats and three Republicans. ruled that the Republican-run state legislature s congressional district map was an illegal partisan gerrymander and adopted a more balanced map in February. The decision infuriated Republicans. who promised to spend more money than ever before in their bid to win control of the court.Those groups are now spending millions to boost the bid of GOP law professor Trey Allen s campaign to defeat incumbent Democratic Justice Sam Ervin IV and. in the race for an open seat on the court. Republican Richard Dietz over Democrat Lucy Inman. both of whom are appellate court judges. Republicans only need to win one of two seats to gain a majority on the court.Republicans in the state legislature have already filed a lawsuit in state courts to reverse the supreme court s prior decision on their legislative district maps. If Republicans flip the court. they could rule in favor of gerrymandered maps that give a heavy advantage to their own party.But that s not all the court could change if it flips. The Democratic majority on the court has issued numerous decisions in recent years on criminal justice and voting rights that would be in jeopardy if Democrats lose in November.The Democratic-majority court has limited prison sentences for minors. made it harder to purge jury pools of Black people. and freed some death row prisoners from a law that limited their ability to challenge their convictions due to racial bias.On voting rights. the court prevented Republicans from seizing control of running elections in the state and imposing an onerous voter identification requirement.case of Moore v. HarperAnd then there is abortion. North Carolina currently allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. but if Republicans win a legislative supermajority they could pass a harsher ban over Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper s veto and a GOP-controlled court could uphold it.In the two ostensibly nonpartisan races for the Montana Supreme Court. abortion and election law also take precedence.In 2019. the state s highest court upheld its 1999 precedent protecting abortion rights in the state by a 4-3 vote. All of the justices who ruled in that decision are still on the bench today. but two are up for reelection in November.Justice Ingrid Gayle Gustafson. who is backed by Democrats. faces GOP-backed former state lawmaker James Brown. Meanwhile. Justice James Rice. backed by Republicans. faces Billings-based attorney Bill D Alton. who is backed by Democrats. Republicans would need to win both races to flip the majority on the court.Montana has long bucked national trends as a rare state where voters still split their tickets. Despite voting for every Republican presidential candidate going back to 1996. the state elected Democratic governors to serve from 2005 to 2020.But the state swung hard to the right in the 2020 election with Republicans taking control of every statewide office by wide margins. They have since tried to solidify their victories by passing voting restrictions aimed at making it more difficult for Democratic Party constituencies like students and Native Americans to vote.Election law is another area where the judicial elections will matter a lot. In September. the court ruled that voting restrictions. including an end to same-day voter registration and more stringent voter identification rules. passed by the GOP in 2021 were unconstitutional.If Republicans win a majority on the court. the legislature would likely repass these restrictions and see them upheld.Republicans would take control of the Illinois Supreme Court if they win both of the seats up for grabs in November.Republican incumbent Justice Michael Burke is being challenged by Democratic appellate Judge Mary O Brien. In an open-seat race. Mark Curran. the Republican former Lake County sheriff. is running against Democratic circuit court Judge Elizabeth Rochford.Both judicial districts were redrawn following the 2020 census to be more favorable to Republicans.The stakes may not be as high in these races as in the other states where abortion rights could go away with the flip of the court. That s because the solidly Democratic state legislature passed — and Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed — legal protections for abortion rights prior to the Supreme Court s overturning of Roe v. Wade.That doesn t mean control of the court doesn t matter. Anti-abortion litigants continue to challenge the state s abortion protections and other reproductive rights laws in state courts. And there are sure to be new issues that arise as Illinois stakes its place as a safe haven for abortion-seeking travelers coming from states where the procedure is now banned.Both Burke and Curran have attended events hosted by the anti-abortion group Right to Life in the past. Curran also celebrated after seeing the leak of the Supreme Court s Dobbs decision in May. I never thought I would see this day.  Curran posted on Facebook.  This is why we voted for Trump. Planned Parenthood Illinois Action is working with other local groups to mobilize opposition to the two GOP candidates. They have produced and run television ads. sent direct mail. and are door-knocking to make sure voters know about where the candidates stand in these lesser-known races. We cannot take things for granted.  said Brigid Leahy. vice president of Planned Parenthood Illinois Action.  All the progress that s been made. that could go away if we re not careful.

Eight years ago. a whistleblower accused a credit card processor for many of Manhattan s topflight hotels. including the Waldorf Astoria and the Trump Hotels. of dodging New York state taxes.The person alleged that the company. POST Integrations. was using the fact that it is headquartered in Arizona as an excuse not to pay New York. despite doing much of its business there. The case went to court. But instead of battling over the core issue — whether POST Integrations knowingly committed tax fraud — the two sides spent years litigating over whether the company had technically ever lied about it. The company initially argued that it couldn t be accused of submitting a false record because it never filed that New York tax return. And. in a sense. they were right.The New York state law that allows whistleblowers to expose tax fraud has what critics say is a glaring loophole that protects the state s most skillful tax cheats. While filing a false tax return is criminal. the law doesn t allow whistleblowers to bring an accusation without pointing to a false record.It remains difficult to prosecute someone who is not paying the taxes they owe but who is clever enough not to leave a paper trail. Why in the world should it matter to authorities whether someone committed tax fraud by filing a false tax return or by never filing anything?  asked Gregory Krakower. who drafted the original law more than a decade ago as counsel to the New York attorney general and has fought to close the loophole. he is now an adjunct professor at Cardozo Law School.  If a large. out-of-state company knowingly and improperly pays no taxes and never filed a return. are we going to protect and empower that? It makes no sense. But as bizarre as the loophole may be. it has survived multiple attempts to slam it shut. Now. a bill to close the loophole is headed to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul s desk — with a coalition of the state s largest business interests lined up in opposition.A court allowed the case against POST Integrations to go forward in 2017 based on another section of the law. which continues to this day. An attorney for the company did not respond to a request for comment.The loophole exists within a law that allows the attorney general or whistleblowers to sue wealthy individuals and corporations they believe are committing tax fraud. New York is the realm of legendary tax cheats. like hotel heiress Leona Helmsley and the ex-corporate titan Dennis Kozlowski dodged millions in sales taxes on fine art and spent stolen corporate funds on such extravagances as a $6.000 shower curtain. In 2010. under the shadow of scandals like these. the state legislature updated the New York False Claims Act. an existing law against making fraudulent claims to the government. to include tax fraud.The new law permitted suits against people or companies with more than $1 million in annual income who allegedly owe at least $350.000. It entitled a whistleblower who brings a successful lawsuit to receive about 20% of any recovered tax revenue.Large. powerful interests were  apoplectic.  Krakower recalled. And so. in 2013. they fought back when the legislature attempted to amend the False Claims Act again. Lawmakers passed a new provision that made it a crime to  knowingly  defraud the state government. even if the violator never made a false statement or false record — but a group of Republicans inserted a loophole that excepted cases of tax fraud.Proponents of closing the loophole fear this favors out-of-state corporations. Such as those that do business in New York but pretend otherwise or the wealthy snowbird who files his returns in low-tax Florida but secretly spends most of his time in New York. These are not people the tax department could find on their own.  said New York State Sen. Liz Krueger. who chairs the chamber s finance committee. Krueger has sponsored a bill. which has passed in the state legislature and is now heading to the governor s desk. that would close the loophole by making it a crime to  knowingly  commit tax fraud whether or not that involved a false record. It is a small. senseless loophole that allows tax cheats to get away with tax fraud by carefully avoiding using a false record or filing a false N.Y. tax return.  Krueger and State Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein. who sponsored the legislation in the general assembly. wrote in a recent letter to Hochul.A broad coalition of business councils from around the state and an organization representing thousands of employees for the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte. Ernst & Young. KPMG. and PricewaterhouseCoopers — have all called for Hochul to veto the bill. She vetoed a similar measure on New Year s Eve in 2021. echoing their concerns that the bill is too broad and might implicate corporations and accountants unaware they owed state taxes.Krueger believes this latest version addresses those concerns. noting the bill only criminalizes  knowing  fraud. But the opposition is holding fast. Why should we want to be liable for conduct that we don t know about. or if our client supplies us with fraudulent information?  said Kevin McCoy. chair of the New York State Society of CPA s legislative task force. They should be worried that we re writing a law where there s a liability for them.  Krueger said.  Getting it right is what they get paid to do. A spokesman for Hochul. Justin Henry. said she s reviewing the legislation.Notwithstanding the loophole. the originators of whistleblower law hold it up as a runaway success. Since 2010. New York has recovered roughly $585 million from tax matters. A hedge fund that claimed to be located in Alabama paid the city and state $70 million. In 2018. Sprint settled with New York City and the state for a whopping $330 million in unpaid sales taxes. Because these fraud claims proceed through the court. they are not bogged down by the interminable delays that face whistleblowers at the federal level. where the IRS handles tips. At the same time. the overall number of cases in New York. about 20 per year. has been modest — proof said Krueger and others. that the cases tend to be high-quality and not the kinds of fishing expeditions opponents of the law once warned about.Other states have taken notice.

Val DemingsMarco RubioJoe BidenRubio. a two-term senator. and Demings. a three-term congresswoman and former Orlando police chief. faced questions at the West Palm Beach debate on topics including inflation. abortion. voting rights. gun violence. immigration and foreign policy.Republicans now lead Democrats with voter registrationRubio skirted a question on whether he would support a federal abortion ban with no exceptions and instead called Demings  position extreme because she would not say what limits on abortion she would support. Every bill I have ever sponsored on abortion and every bill I ve ever voted for has exceptions.  Rubio said. What we know is that the senator supports no exceptions.  Demings responded.  He can make his mouth say anything today. He is good at that. by the way. What day is it and what is Marco Rubio saying? overturn Roe v.

Demings said.But Rubio defended his opposition to gun restrictions. saying some proposals would not have stopped many of the mass shootings and Americans have a Second Amendment right to protect themselves. Everything she is for would have done nothing to stop any of those shootings.  Rubio said.  Every one of these shooters would have passed the background check that she keeps insisting on. No one here is in favor of mass shootings and violence. To address inflation. Rubio said the U.S. needs to stop spending so much money. citing some pandemic relief funds. and to boost domestic oil production. He chastised the Biden administration for its decision to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve to help bring down prices at the pump. Oil reserves do not exist to win midterms.  Rubio said.Demings said the pandemic relief money was necessary to help hurting families and businesses. Of course the senator who has never run anything at all but his mouth would know nothing about helping people and being there for people when they are in trouble.  Demings said.Rubio also attacked Demings for not passing legislation in Washington. saying all she had done was get post offices named after people. Demings angrily rejected his characterization. noting the buildings were named after police officers who died in the line of duty.  It s embarrassing that you think that honoring a person who was a hero by naming a federal building after them is nothing.  she said.Demings repeatedly accused Rubio of distorting her record and positions on issues. I am really disappointed in you. Marco Rubio. because I think there was a time when you did not lie in order to win.  she said.Rubio maintained that Demings was simply there to support Biden s and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s agenda. while calling himself the most effective senator. In the two terms I ve been there. no U.S. senator has gotten more done than I have.  he said.  The only thing she does is vote 100% with Pelosi. Asked whether he would accept the results of the 2022 election. Rubio said.  Sure. because I m going to win. Later. he clarified that  no matter what the outcome is. I ll support it. because Florida has good laws. They re not some crazy laws like they have in Pennsylvania and these other places. ,Politics News

Joe BidenOPEC+ nationsstrategic reserveBiden will also open the door to additional releases this winter in an effort to bring prices down. but administration officials would not detail how much the president would be willing to tap and the conditions under which he would do so.Biden will also say that the U.S. government will restock the strategic reserve when oil prices are at or lower than $67 to $72 a barrel. an offer that administration officials argue will increase domestic production by guaranteeing a baseline level of demand even if prices fall. Yet the president is also expected to renew his criticism of the profits reaped by oil companies — repeating a bet made this summer that public condemnation would matter more to these companies than shareholders  focus on returns.It marks the continuation of an about-face by Biden. who has tried to move the U.S. past fossil fuels to identify additional sources of energy to satisfy U.S. and global supply as a result of disruptions from Russia s invasion of Ukraine and production cuts announced by the Saudi Arabia-led oil cartel.The prospective loss of 2 million barrels a day — 2% of global supply — has had the White House saying Saudi Arabia sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin and pledging there will be consequences for supply cuts that could prop up energy prices. The 15 million-barrel release would not cover even one full day s use of oil in the U.S.. according to the Energy Information Administration.The administration could make a decision on future releases a month from now. as it requires a month and a half for the strategic reserve to notify would-be buyers.Biden had pledged to speak about his plans to reduce gasoline prices this week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say what policies Biden will discuss. telling reporters at Tuesday s briefing.  I will let the president speak for himself. Jared Bernstein. a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. said a past release of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve contributed to a decline in prices at the pump this summer. That decline ended last month as prices began to rise again. though they ve eased somewhat in the past week.Fox News There are still 400 million barrels of oil in the strategic reserve — it is more than half full.  Bernstein said. adding that Biden had not yet made a final decision on releasing more barrels.DemocratsAn analysis Monday by ClearView Energy Partners. an independent energy research firm based in Washington. suggested that two states that could decide control of the evenly split Senate — Nevada and Pennsylvania — are sensitive to energy prices. The analysis noted that gas prices over the past month rose above the national average in 18 states. which are home to 29 potentially  at risk  House seats.Even if voters want cheaper gasoline. expected gains in supply are not materializing because of a weaker global economy. The U.S. government last week revised downward its forecasts. saying that domestic firms would produce 270.000 fewer barrels a day in 2023 than was forecast in September. Global production would be 600.000 barrels a day lower than forecast in September.The hard math for Biden is that oil production has yet to return to its pre-pandemic level of roughly 13 million barrels a day. It s about a million barrels a day shy of that level. The oil industry would like the administration to open up more federal lands for drilling. approve pipeline construction and reverse its recent changes to raise corporate taxes. The administration counters that the oil industry is sitting on thousands of unused federal leases and says new permits would take years to produce oil with no impact on current gas prices. Environmental groups. meanwhile. have asked Biden to keep a campaign promise to block new drilling on federal lands.Biden has resisted the policies favored by U.S. oil producers. Instead. he s sought to reduce prices by releasing oil from the U.S. reserve. shaming oil companies for their profits and calling on greater production from countries in OPEC+ that have different geopolitical interests. said Frank Macchiarola. senior vice president of policy. economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute. If they continue to offer the same old so-called solutions. they ll continue to get the same old results.  Macchiarola said.Because fossil fuels lead to carbon emissions. Biden has sought to move away from them entirely with a commitment to zero emissions by 2050. When discussing that commitment nearly a year ago after the G-20 leading rich and developing nations met in Rome. the president said he still wanted to also lower gas prices because at  $3.35 a gallon. it has profound impact on working-class families just to get back and forth to work. Since Biden spoke of the pain of gas at $3.35 a gallon and his hopes to reduce costs. the price has risen another 15.5%.___Follow AP s coverage of the 2022 midterms: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections,Politics News

FBIDonald TrumpThe case against Igor Danchenko was the third and possibly final case brought by Special Counsel John Durham as part of his probe into how the FBI conducted its own investigation into allegations of collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and the Kremlin.The first two cases ended in an acquittal and a guilty plea with a sentence of probation.Danchenko betrayed no emotion as the verdict was read. His wife wiped away tears after the fourth and final  not guilty  was read by the clerk.The acquittal marked a significant setback for Durham. who declined to comment after the hearing. as did several jurors.Despite hopes by Trump supporters that the prosecutor would uncover a sweeping conspiracy within the FBI and other agencies to derail his candidacy. and then his presidency. the investigation over the course of more than three years failed to produce evidence that met those expectations. The sole conviction — an FBI agent admitted altering an email related to the surveillance of a former Trump aide — was for conduct uncovered not by Durham but by the Justice Department s inspector general. and the two cases that Durham took to trials ended in across-the-board acquittals.The Danchenko case was the first of the three to delve deeply into the origins of the  Steele dossier.  a compendium of allegations that Trump s 2016 presidential campaign was colluding with the Kremlin.Most famously. it alleged that the Russians could have blackmail material on Trump for his supposed interactions with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel. Trump derided the dossier as fake news and a political witch hunt when it became public in 2017.Danchenko. by his own admission. was responsible for 80% of the raw intelligence in the dossier and half of the accompanying analysis. though trial testimony indicated that Danchenko was shocked and dismayed about how Steele presented the material and portrayed it as factual when Danchenko considered it more to be rumor and speculation.Prosecutors said that if Danchenko had been more honest about his sources. the FBI might not have treated the dossier so credulously. As it turned out. the FBI used material from the dossier to support applications for warrantless surveillance of a Trump campaign official. Carter Page. even though the FBI never was able to corroborate a single allegation in the dossier.Prosecutors said Danchenko lied about the identity of his own sources for the material he gave to Steele. The specific charges against Danchenko allege that he essentially fabricated one of his sources when the FBI interviewed him to determine how he derived the material he provided for the dossier.Danchenko told the FBI that some of the material came when he received an anonymous call from a man he believed to be Sergei Millian. a former president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce.Prosecutors said Danchenko s story made no sense. They said that phone records show no evidence of a call. and that Danchenko had no reason to believe Millian. a Trump supporter he d never met. was suddenly going to be willing to provide disparaging information about Trump to a stranger.Danchenko s lawyers. as a starting point. maintain that Danchenko never said he talked with Millian. He only guessed that Millian might have been the caller when the FBI asked him to speculate. And they said he shouldn t be convicted of a crime for making a guess at the FBI s invitation.That said. Danchenko s lawyers say. he had good reason to believe the caller may well have been Millian. The call came just a few days after Danchenko had reached out to Millian over email after a mutual acquaintance brokered a connection over email.And Danchenko s lawyers say it s irrelevant that his phone records don t show a call because Danchenko told the FBI from the start that the call might have taken place over a secure mobile app for which he had no records.The jury began deliberations Monday afternoon after hearing closing arguments on four counts. On Friday. U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga threw out a fifth count. saying prosecutors had failed to prove it as a matter of law.,Politics News
Nearly two yearsBut body camera footage recently obtained by HuffPost casts the incident in a much different light. It shows Sean Bush. a deputy from the Hillsborough County Sheriff s Office. choking DeLeon and slamming her to the ground. Other deputies who arrived at the scene shackled DeLeon while pinning her to the ground. The case drew little public attention in 2020. DeLeon. 24 at the time. was sentenced to 30 days in jail after receiving credit for time served. DeLeon was fatally stabbedwas arrestedKatherine Viker. a Tallahassee-based attorney. said her office requested the footage of DeLeon s arrest while investigating a separate incident of excessive use of force involving another deputy in the department. Viker s office is not representing DeLeon s family in any capacity. We learned of this encounter and we are shocked by what he saw.  Viker told HuffPost in a statement. WARNING: Violent arrest photos and video are visible below.The Hillsborough County Sheriff s Office has denied any wrongdoing in DeLeon s arrest and said Bush s choking of DeLeon was an accident. Bush received a letter of reprimand and mandatory training. a response that the sheriff s office says it stands by. Following review of body-worn camera video. HCSO launched a thorough and timely internal investigation.  an HCSO spokesperson said in a statement last week.  It was determined that while responding to the domestic violence incident. the suspect continuously refused to follow commands on scene and was physically combative with the deputy. The suspect grabbed the deputy s wrist. throwing him off balance. and at that time. the deputy unintentionally briefly used techniques that are not in line with HCSO s procedures. use-of-force policyThe sheriff s office s investigators said DeLeon appeared to be intoxicated while interacting with Bush but that there was no clear indication that she posed a physical threat to anyone. On Nov. 27. 2020. Bush responded to a report of a domestic dispute and found DeLeon and other people standing outside a residence in Town ‘n  Country. Florida. a Tampa suburb.The bodycam footage shows DeLeon greeting Bush with a fist bump and asking him why he is there. DeLeon turns around and asks people nearby if they called Bush to the home. Bush asks DeLeon to have a seat. but she responds that he s on her property. DeLeon then asks Bush to return to his car. saying no one called him to the home. before asking him to come back but to give her six feet of space due to coronavirus risks. She gives Bush a second fist bump. You re so awesome. Thank you for your service.  DeLeon is recorded saying to the deputy before the two are quiet for a few seconds.Bush then steps in the direction of a vehicle parked outside the house. and DeLeon raises her arm and asks him not to touch the vehicle because of the coronavirus. Bush says.  Don t touch me  and takes DeLeon to the ground. grabbing her arm. shirt and neck. DeLeon. who is unarmed. tries to get up. but Bush grabs her by the neck again and pulls out his stun gun. DeLeon repeatedly shouts.  I m epileptic!  as Bush uses the stun gun on her.Bush shouts at DeLeon to put her hands behind her back again. then strikes her with the stun gun a second time.  You re coming to my house. but nobody called you.  DeLeon protests in the footage.  You re on my property and nobody said they called you. Two other deputies soon arrive at the scene. and one kneels on DeLeon. Bush can be heard in the video making a derogatory. transphobic statement about DeLeon.  Just keep whatever it is down.  he can be heard saying in reference to DeLeon.Deputies handcuff DeLeon s legs and wrists together as more deputies and a medic arrive.They tell DeLeon several times to  stop resisting.  and she replies that she isn t.On Nov. 30. 2020. another deputy in the Hillsborough County Sheriff s Office requested an internal investigation into Bush s actions during DeLeon s arrest and alleged that the deputy had used derogatory language and excessive force. according to documents obtained by HuffPost. The investigation began on Dec. 2. 2020. and was completed the following month.Bush received a standards letter on March 1. 2021. which HuffPost has obtained. It says the investigation found no evidence of Bush making derogatory remarks or of the deputy using  excessive or unnecessary force.  but it acknowledges that Bush grabbed DeLeon by the throat. The letter calls the chokehold  brief and unintentional.  noting that such a response  was admittedly not part of any training Deputy Bush has received as a member of the Sheriff s Office.  Bush has remained active with the department. The sheriff s office claims in other documents that DeLeon had grabbed Bush by the wrist. causing the deputy to  lose his balance. and had pushed Bush.After the incident. DeLeon was charged with battery. battery on a law enforcement officer. depriving an officer of means of protection or communication. and resisting an officer with violence. according to court records. Viker pushed back on the department s narrative about the arrest and said the deputies present had not been held accountable.  You see the video. what they said happened compared to what actually happened is not true.  Viker told HuffPost.  The video is the best representation of what actually occurred. Videos don t lie.

WASHINGTON — If Republicans win control of the U.S. House of Representatives next month. they could hold the government s credit hostage to force spending cuts ― including to programs like Social Security and Medicare. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other lawmakers said this month they ll use the federal government s  debt ceiling  to try to pry policy concessions from Democrats.  You can t just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt.  McCarthy told Punchbowl News in an interview published Tuesday.  And if people want to make a debt ceiling [for a longer period of time]. just like anything else. there comes a point in time where. OK. we ll provide you more money. but you got to change your current behavior.  McCarthy said.  We re not just going to keep lifting your credit card limit. right? The debt ceiling is a legal limit on the amount of money that the federal government can borrow in order to pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. Raising the debt limit doesn t create new spending. it just prevents the government from defaulting on its debts. A federal debt default would be unprecedented in modern times and could have catastrophic economic consequences. Republicans used it as leverage during the presidency of Barack Obama. but not when Donald Trump was president. Now that a Democrat is in the White House. debt ceiling drama is back.  The debt ceiling is the natural place from which you can operate to affect spending change.  Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told HuffPost earlier this month. The Treasury Department has said Congress will have to deal with the debt ceiling again sometime next year. though the timing is imprecise because it depends on somewhat unpredictable fluctuations in federal revenue and outlays.Republicans threatened to block a debt limit increase last year. but 14 Senate Republicans ultimately voted in favor of allowing Democrats to raise the ceiling by themselves with a simple majority vote. Such an outcome would be much more complicated if Republicans control the House. Republican House members vying to chair the House Budget Committee in the event of a GOP House majority told Bloomberg Government that they would use the debt limit to try to make Democrats agree to changes to Social Security and Medicare. Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas). for instance. said he favors raising the eligibility age for both programs.Social Security and Medicare provide monthly cash and medical benefits to older Americans. and past proposals to cut the programs have proven unpopular before lawmakers abandoned them. Medicare s hospital insurance trust fund faces a shortfall in 2028. while Social Security s trust fund will remain solvent until 2034. according to the latest projections. In 2011. Republicans won  discretionary  spending cuts as part of a debt ceiling standoff with Obama. The discretionary side of the federal budget is smaller than the  mandatory  side that includes programs like food benefits. Social Security and Medicare. The cuts affected a range of government services. including grants for Meals on Wheels programs that delivered hot meals to the elderly and disabled. Even if Republicans won the House and the Senate. Democrats would retain the ability to block legislation in the upper chamber. and President Biden would still have a veto pen. but Republicans would likely bet that Democrats would agree to their demands rather than risk a debt default. which could roil financial markets. One influential Democrat. House Ways and Means chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.). told HuffPost this month that Democrats would consider handling the debt limit in a lame-duck session before the end of the year rather than give Republicans the opportunity to threaten to blow up the economy next year. But Democrats have so far passed up opportunities to make the debt ceiling less of a nuisance by raising it by a huge amount or simply abolishing it. ,Politics News

The political arm of the largest think tank affiliated with the Democratic Party says the party has a chance to convince voters extremism makes GOP candidates unelectable. but is warning it will take more than a focus on abortion rights to do the trick.A new analysis and polling from the Center for American Progress Action Fund found a huge portion of GOP candidates in swing House seats embrace unpopular right-wing positions on Medicare and Social Security. election denial and abortion rights.  Sometimes we get caught up on the shiny MAGA extremists and view them as outliers.  said Navin Nayak. the president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. referring to Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.  And what the data underscores is that MAGA extremists are at the core of who the Republican Party is today. You would think that Republicans would moderate away from these extreme positions. but they haven t.  While political forecasters continue to give Democrats a strong chance at holding the Senate. Republicans remain heavily favored to take control of the House in November. in large part because keeping the chamber would require Democrats to essentially sweep toss-up districts. CAP Action looked at those districts and found plenty of material for Democrats to work with — if the party can find the money necessary to do so. The group looked at GOP candidates in the 30 House seats considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report. races where you would expect candidates of either party to rush to the center of the electorate. Instead. they found candidates who embraced a host of unpopular conservative stances: Two-thirds had refused to accept President Joe Biden s 2020 victory. 60% support a national abortion ban or restrictions that do not include exceptions for rape and incest and 47% support cutting Social Security and Medicare in some form or fashion. What s been surprising about this cycle is how reflexive the extremism of Republican candidates is. and how ubiquitous their willingness to embrace extreme positions is.  said Geoff Garin. a Democratic pollster whose research has helped shape CAP s vision of  MAGA Republicans.  a term picked up and frequently used by President Joe Biden.  This is why Democrats could defy history and a lot of economic headwinds. For instance. Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.). who represents a district Biden won handily. voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election and has co-sponsored federal fetal personhood legislation. Republican Karoline Leavitt. who is challenging Rep. Chris Pappas in New Hampshire. has insisted Trump won the election and said she would write legislation privatizing Social Security.In polling provided to HuffPost. Garin looked at all voters who don t identify as strong supporters of President Donald Trump or as  MAGA Republicans  — in other words. everyone a standard Democratic campaign might try to persuade or communicate with — and found 55% said ending Social Security and Medicare was one of their top three concerns about what Republicans might do in power. with 17% saying it was their top concern. Forty-one percent said passing a nationwide abortion ban was one of their top three concerns. with 15% naming it a top concern. with another 39% percent saying allowing partisan officials to overturn elections was a top-three concern and 16% placing it at the top of the list.Crucially. Garin noted. the three messages reach different groups: While swing voters who backed Biden are receptive to concerns about election denial and abortion rights. independents and older voters care deeply about protecting Social Security. It s clear abortion is an extremely powerful and salient issue for voters. but Republicans have given Democrats the ability to reach an additional group of voters because of the willingness to cut Social Security and Medicare.  Garin said. Protecting abortion rights has been the major theme of Democratic advertising thus far. Republican threats to Social Security and Medicare have been a prominent secondary theme. showing up in Democratic advertising in key Senate races like Colorado and New Hampshire. Comparatively few Democratic campaigns have made election denial an advertising topic. though Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto did begin airing an ad attacking Republican Adam Laxalt for his involvement in  The Big Lie  earlier this month.Garin noted Democrats need to look forward when discussing election denial. looking at threats to results in 2022 or 2024 rather than simply trying to relitigate the Jan. 6 insurrection or the 2020 election. If you re talking about this in a backward-looking way. it s less impactful.  he said.  People really resent it when politicians float the possibility of canceling their votes and overturning elections. CAP s analysis and recommendations. oddly enough. are somewhat similar to what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in an op-ed for The Guardian. arguing Democrats need to talk about issues beyond abortion. (Neera Tanden. CAP s former president and now a White House staffer. was a long-time prominent Sanders critic. leading to frequent clashes between CAP and those in Sanders  orbit.) In my view. while the abortion issue must remain on the front burner. it would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of the economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.  Sanders wrote. Indeed. a very Sanders-friendly line of attack. arguing Republicans would raise taxes on the working class while cutting them for the wealthy. was the fourth-most powerful argument CAP Action tested. with 12% naming it a top concern and 39% putting it in the top three.

Donald Trumplatest reportFormer CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said the administration restricted agency officials from participating in media interviews or briefings. at a time when he thought Americans  should have heard from the public health leaders. The White House tried to assert control over public guidance on COVID-19. with Trump installing his ally Michael Caputo as assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. the CDC s parent agency.Kate Galatas. a senior communications official at the CDC. told the subcommittee that Caputo acted with the intention of making others  feel threatened. The subcommittee saw evidence that Caputo blasted Dr. Jay Butler. the CDC s deputy director of infectious diseases. for being  too alarming  during a June 2020 telebriefing. In a separate instance. Paul Alexander. a senior adviser to Caputo. wrote to CDC officials to attack one of their reports. which he considered contradictory to information that the White House was putting out. and to allege that the agency s work was hurting the administration. as well as Americans at large.In May 2020. Alexander also edited language in a draft CDC statement regarding the pandemic s death toll in the U.S. to make it  more positive.  according to an email reviewed by the subcommittee.Redfield also said the administration  compromised  the agency s COVID-19 guidance in several instances to paint a rosier picture of the pandemic.Trump officials  efforts to project a better image of the pandemic in the U.S. affected employee morale but also could have put lives in danger. according to the report.Dr. Anne Schuchat. principal deputy director at the CDC. told the subcommittee that she believed fewer Americans would have died in the early days of the pandemic if the CDC had been allowed to put out accurate information.Redfield said that he developed post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of managing the writing process for COVID-19 guidance during his time in office.The report also demonstrated the extent to which Trump s White House sought to use the CDC s authority to push its own political agenda.Dr. Martin Cetron. the director of CDC s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. said his department was  handed  an order to justify deporting asylum-seekers arriving at the U.S. border under Title 42. a 1944 public health law that would immediately return them to their countries of origin while also denying them the opportunity to apply for asylum. Redfield was the one to sign the order.Joe Bidencourt has so far blocked itCetron also told the subcommittee that the Trump administration was hesitant to issue a mask mandate on public transportation even though the private sector had urged it to do so. Cetron said such rules around masks could have prevented the deaths of many Americans from COVID-19 in 2020.The subcommittee also found that administration officials tried to block the release  of at least 19 different CDC scientific reports that they deemed to be politically harmful to President Trump. Specifically. Health and Human Services officials manipulated a CDC publication known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to obscure early signs of COVID-19 transmission.House investigators found that the Trump administration also used hundreds of millions of dollars in CDC funds for a campaign. led by Caputo. to  defeat despair and inspire hope  around the pandemic before the 2020 presidential election.an interview with CNNCNNsaid in a statement This prioritization of politics. contempt for science. and refusal to follow the advice of public health experts harmed the nation s ability to respond effectively to the coronavirus crisis and put Americans at risk.  Clyburn said.The South Carolinian said work still remains to  safeguard scientific integrity and restore the American people s trust in our public health institutions. The subcommittee has been investigating the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic for over two years. This is its third report to be published.,Politics News
Joe BidenRoe v. WadeDemocratsBiden made the pledge at a Democratic National Committee event Tuesday afternoon at The Howard theater in Washington. On a stage surrounded by pro-choice supporters and a huge banner that read  Restore Roe.  the president promised to sign the legislation on Jan. 22. 2023 — the 50th anniversary of the original Roe decision. Here s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade.  Biden said.  And when Congress passes it. I will sign it in January. 50 years after Roe was first decided to be the law of the land.  If you do your part and vote Democratic leaders in Congress. I promise you we ll do our part. I ll do mine part. With your support. I ll sign a law codifying Roe in January.  he added. overturned Roe v. WadeabortionRepublicans  It s this simple: If anti-choice Republicans win control of Congress. they will pass a national ban on abortion. If Democrats win. they will defend Roe and the president will sign the Women s Health Protection Act.  NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a Tuesday statement.The Women s Health Protection Act is federal legislation that aims to protect the right to access legal abortion care across the country by providing safeguards against state bans and medically unnecessary hurdles ― effectively codifying Roe. Congress has voted on the bill multiple times. but it twice died by filibuster in the Senate.  Extremist GOP lawmakers are the number one threat to our reproductive freedom. and they aim to take us back in time. That s not the America we want for our children. and that s not the America this nation elected Joe Biden to deliver.  added Timmaraju.  We thank the president for his leadership as we fight to restore the right to abortion and protect reproductive freedom. The intransigence of Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on changing the terms of the Senate filibuster has stymied Democratic efforts to codify the right to abortion after the Dobbs decision. meaning Democrats would have to pick up two seats in that chamber to make Biden s pledge a reality.Holding the House might be the tougher task. Political forecasters still consider Republicans heavy favorites to win control of the chamber. ,Politics News
Tucker CarlsonDemocratsFox Newsprioritizing marketing and outreach over family-care funds So. really what you have here is a classic demand-side approach to the ongoing diaper and formula shortages: just don t have kids. dumbo. and then you won t need diapers.  Carlson opined.  You also won t need a house or a car or a raise or extra food or money for college tuition.  When you get to this point. and this point is a place where the economy is so completely distorted that only Democratic voters ― donors ― can still afford to have normal families. When you get there. the solution is simple: Don t reproduce! Childlessness is the cure for the economy they created. And that s why abortion is so very important. especially now. Fast-forward to 3:24 for that segment:Carlson has layered his right-wing worldview onto abortion rights before. In 2019. he infamously claimed Democrats favor access to abortion because it makes business sense.Carlson saidMedia Matters,Politics News
Russian President Vladimir Putin is using billionaire Elon Musk to broadcast terms for ending his war in Ukraine. former top National Security Council analyst Fiona Hill said.Hill told Politico in an interview published Monday that Putin has chosen Musk in a well-worn playbook of using prominent businesspeople to communicate his demands to a wider audience.  Putin plays the egos of big men. gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality. they re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.  Hill told Politico. Musk. the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. earlier this month shared suggestions for ending the war with his followers on Twitter. earning the condemnation of Ukrainian officials. His proposal included redoing  elections  in the four Ukraine regions Putin annexed  under U.N. supervision.  referring to the sham referendums the Kremlin organized in these regions. Musk also suggested formally declaring Crimea. which Putin illegally annexed in 2014. part of Russia.currentlyHill also pointed to Musk s proposal to guarantee the water supply of Crimea. which Ukrainian officials curtailed after the annexation by blocking water from Ukraine s Dnipro River to the peninsula. as a sign of his communications with the Russian leader.  It s unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself.  Hill said.  The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin.  Ian Bremmer. founder of the prominent political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group. reported Musk told him Putin was  prepared to negotiate  with Ukraine if some of his terms were met.denied Hill said by using Musk as a messenger. Putin  is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process  to advance his goals. He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up.  Hill said.  All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.  Hill said Putin s selection of Musk as a messenger is  fascinating  in part because the world s richest person has been supporting Ukraine through SpaceX s Starlink satellite internet service. which has been used by the Ukrainian military.CNNHill noted that Putin wants to reshape the international order and that his invasion of Ukraine is having a destabilizing effect by putting global energy and food security at risk. The Ukraine conflict already means  our world is not going to be the same as it was before.  she said. It s ironic that Elon Musk. the man who has been talking about getting us to Mars. should be Putin s messenger for the war in Ukraine. when we re having a really hard time getting our act together on this planet.  Hill said.Hill testified against then-President Donald Trump during his first impeachment. after working at the National Security Council as a senior European and Russian affairs expert. She also served in the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.,Politics News
Since 1950. Wisconsin s average temperatures have climbed 3 degrees Fahrenheit and its yearly rainfall has increased by 17%. drowning crops and plaguing those that survive with white mold that costs farmers dearly. But Democrats are hoping the chaos might yield another term in the governor s mansion.A new 30-second ad from the progressive climate group Evergreen Action. which grew out of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee s climate-focused 2020 presidential bid. praises Evers  plan to move the state to 100% clean energy by the end of the decade. a tactic the group hopes can fire up young and liberal voters in one of the closest gubernatorial races in the country. In every corner of our state. Wisconsinites feel the impact of a changing climate. from the effects on our crops and livestock to the damage to our roads and highways.  a man s voice intones over soft piano music and stock footage. boasting the plan will help the state s roads and agriculture while creating 40.000 new jobs.  That s why Gov. Tony Evers has a plan to take action.  Home to mega farms and manufacturers churning out food and beverages. the state is a major energy user. In 1997. coal-fired power plants made up 82% of Wisconsin s electricity production. This past June. that number was down to 31% — still above the national average. according to Energy Information Administration data. And natural gas — which produces less carbon dioxide than coal but spews an even-more-potent greenhouse gas called methane — has largely made up the difference. producing 41% of the state s power. Wisconsin. meanwhile. generates a lower-than-average share of its electricity from zero-carbon nuclear reactors or renewable plants.In April. Evers issued the state s first energy transition plan. a 172-page proposal that included ideas to rapidly dramatically update Wisconsin building codes. create a new system to encourage utilities to ditch natural gas for geothermal heat. and ramp up energy efficiency standards. This month. the governor joined Minnesota. Montana and North Dakota in a bid for federal backing to establish a regional hub for producing hydrogen. a fuel that produces no carbon when burned and thus is widely seen as a possible replacement for oil and coal in manufacturing. In 63 out of 72 Wisconsin counties. large majorities of adults polled last year wanted the governor to  do more to address global warming  according to data from the Yale University Program on Climate Change Communications nationwide annual survey. While the other nine counties saw less than 51% wanting Evers to ramp up climate policy. support remained widespread. with none falling below 48%. The ad. however. is airing on broadcast television in just one of the state s media markets: Madison. the university town and state capital.Madison is a unique television market nationally. While most markets of similarly modest stature — it s the 81st largest market nationally. right behind Toledo. Ohio. and ahead of Colorado Springs. Colorado — have right-leaning rural and suburban audiences. Madison and surrounding Dane County are the heart of Wisconsin liberalism. That means a relatively small ad buy can reach a large number of left-leaning voters for minimal cost. In the case of the Evergreen ad. the group is spending in the middle of the six-figure range and will also run the ad on digital. The race between Evers and construction company owner Tim Michels is the tightest gubernatorial race in the country. with every recent public survey showing a contest within the margin of error.It s also a race where Democratic turnout could make the difference. In the latest Marquette University Law School poll. 46% of registered voters backed Evers and 41% backed Michels. But because Republican voters were more likely to say they were certain to vote in November. the race was neck and neck among likely voters. with 47% backing Evers and 46% backing Michels.Climate has not been a top issue in the race. and the Marquette poll didn t even list climate change as an option when polling the state on its top issues. But climate change came up during a debate on Friday. when Evers touted his clean energy plan and Michels questioned how much human activity was causing climate change.  Temperature has always fluctuated throughout the history of this world.  he said.  We can t just say that it all happened because of man s actions in the last 100 years. The scientific consensus has long supported the idea that man-made carbon emissions have caused the Earth s climate to dramatically increase in temperature since the 1800s. a problem that will only get worse if the world s governments do not work to decrease emissions. ,Politics News
