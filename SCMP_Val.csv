Hong Kong health authorities  latest move to stop taking nasal swab samples for Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests may allow more imported cases to enter the community. but does not pose a risk to the local pandemic situation. medical experts have said.But respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu on Monday said he found it  problematic  for the city s government to opt for a less sensitive method when it had been spending a huge amount of resources on PCR testing.The government earlier announced that from Tuesday. only throat swab samples would be collected for free PCR tests at government-run sites. including those at the airport. to boost the efficiency and capacity of the services.Leung. a former chairman of the Hong Kong Medical Association s advisory committee on communicable diseases. said sensitivity could drop by one-third if only throat swabs were taken. but such a change might have  little effect  on the imported case situation.Overseas studies had shown that the sensitivity of using both samples was 97 per cent. but that of throat swabs only reached 68 per cent. he added. But at this stage. we are not too concerned about imported cases. No matter how much the [tests ] sensitivity decreases. many cases can be detected at the airport.  he told a radio programme on Monday. Even if the imported cases enter the community. it will only lead to a small-scale transmission compared with transmission within the community. The proportion of imported cases among overall infections is still less than 10 per cent. The authorities on Saturday said a throat swab was one of the specimens recommended by the National Health Commission and commonly used in mainland China for PCR tests.They added that the new arrangement had  reliable  sensitivity and could reduce the time for sample collection. as well as streamlining the collection procedure. The adjustment is conducive to enhancing the overall efficiency and boosting the capacity of testing services. while not affecting nucleic acid tests  accuracy.  a government spokesman said. adding that self-paid tests were not subject to the changes.But Leung said he could not understand why such changes were made. This is a bit problematic because the government is wasting a huge amount of resources [on PCR testing]. It also takes up much time for people to head to the testing stations. causing inconvenience.  he said. If you are conducting PCR testing. but using a less sensitive method. it is contradictory to the initial intention of public health. Leung said the amount of PCR testing could be reduced as Hong Kong was on the road to normality. adding that initiatives should be focused on protecting high-risk groups or monitoring areas with an increased prospect of transmission when the healthcare system was under pressure.He also suggested raising the threshold for compulsory testing. or replacing the PCR method with rapid antigen kits.The Health Bureau revealed earlier that from November 2020 to August this year about 37.3 million PCR tests were conducted at community centres. mobile specimen collection stations and during  restriction-testing declaration  operations. As of April. HK$5.8 billion (US$738.8 million) had been spent on this. it said.Tourism. elderly care sectors urge Hong Kong to further ease Covid rulesRicky Chiu Yin-to. an adjunct associate professor at Chinese University s school of biomedical sciences who also operates a medical diagnostics start-up that runs a few testing centres. said while forgoing nasal swabs might increase the risks of having imported cases being leaked into the community. the subsequent mandatory medical surveillance of arrivals could also detect infections.He said the new arrangement could reduce the sample collection time by two-thirds but the results would not be available any earlier.He said although the new arrangement might slightly reduce the tests  sensitivity. it was in line with the government s goal to provide ample. high-quality. speedy. accessible and affordable services.Currently. inbound travellers are required to undergo a PCR test on the first. third. fifth and seventh day of arrival as well as daily RAT tests.,Business News
A seasoned geriatrician and medical professor has been appointed as Hong Kong s first commissioner for primary healthcare as the sector undergoes the biggest reforms in a decade with a shift in focus from hospital to community care.Dr Pang Fei-chau. a clinical associate professor at the University of Hong Kong s faculty of medicine. took up the role on Monday weeks after Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced in his maiden policy address that the government would publish a primary healthcare blueprint.The blueprint aims to revamp the healthcare system from its current treatment-oriented. hospital-based structure to one that is prevention-focused and community-based. Additional resources will be invested to promote primary healthcare.A new healthcare authority with an independent budget will also be set up to ease the burden on the public sector and deliver the blueprint. a move medical industry veterans have described as the biggest reform in a decade. Dr Pang has extensive experience in public healthcare development and management.  a Health Bureau spokesman said on Monday. He will lead the Primary Healthcare Office to take forward primary healthcare development and implement relevant measures set out in the primary healthcare blueprint. including the establishment of the Primary Healthcare Authority and fostering the prevention and management of chronic diseases. New primary care authority mustn t be a ‘toothless tiger . says Sophia ChanBefore joining the university. Pang was head of human resources at the Hospital Authority. providing strategic advice and leadership on workforce operations at more than 40 facilities.He is a specialist in geriatric medicine. president of the Hong Kong College of Community Medicine and a member of the Elderly Commission. a government advisory body.Primary healthcare is the first point of contact for individuals and professionals. focusing on health promotion. disease prevention and management. and supportive care. Successful primary healthcare ultimately reduces the burden on hospitals.Previous city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced a high-level steering committee on primary healthcare development and a pilot district health centre scheme in her first policy address in 2017.Hong Kong leader John Lee sets the most targets for Labour and Welfare BureauSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. providing a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration had also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint. but its publication was delayed. due partly to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.,Business News
Hong Kong should further review its Covid-19 pandemic policies to enable inbound travellers to visit museums and watch football matches. while elderly residents in care homes should be allowed to get some fresh air and join local outdoor tours. industry representatives have said.Players from the city s tourism and elderly care sectors ramped up calls for a further relaxation of rules on Saturday while authorities announced bookings for a new version of the BioNTech vaccine would open on Sunday for children aged six months to under five years old. with the jabs available at four centres citywide.Hong Kong has been implementing a  0+3  arrangement for overseas arrivals for more than a month ever since it abolished hotel quarantine measures in September. Inbound travellers are issued an amber health code under the vaccine pass. limiting their movement citywide during a three-day medical surveillance period.Hong Kong bar owners wonder if crowds of rugby Sevens fans will ever returnIn light of the current measures. lawmaker Perry Yiu Pak-leung. who represents the tourism sector. on Saturday painted a bleak picture for his constituency. telling a radio programme that the  0+3  model was too little. too late.Yiu called the existing amber health code  outdated . arguing that inbound travellers should be allowed to visit museums and watch football matches.  The amber health code is really unreasonable. Why are arrivals allowed to work or go to school but they can t visit museums?  he said.  If they are allowed to visit museums with their masks on. it should be quite safe. Yiu also urged the government to move to a  0+0  scheme as soon as possible. along with dropping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. which he called a turn-off for overseas travellers. If overseas travellers are still required to undergo three PCR tests. it would be difficult to attract them to come to Hong Kong. I think conducting daily antigen rapid tests during the period would suffice.  he said.The lawmaker said the tourism sector was still in trouble with close to 80 per cent of travel agents only recovering a tenth of business at pre-Covid levels. He estimated Hong Kong had lost HK$1 trillion (US$127.4 billion) in tourism dollars over the past three years. based on revenue of more than HK$300 billion generated by the sector in 2018.Tourists ‘should be allowed museum entry  during Hong Kong ‘0+3  surveillanceExecutive Council member Dr Lam Ching-choi. meanwhile. urged authorities to relax visiting and outing arrangements at elderly care homes. to increase communication between such residents and their families.Currently. visitors for elderly care centres need to be triple-jabbed and produce negative PCR results from tests conducted in the past 48 hours. Some care homes also set daily guest quotas.Residents in care homes. classified as one of the most vulnerable groups amid the pandemic. have generally been barred from going out. unless in emergencies or important situations. according to government guidelines. These elderly residents are physically and mentally fatigued from the past two years of not being able to go out. I have suggested to the Social Welfare Department to further relax policies and it has said it would consider the proposals.  the government adviser told the press after an event on Saturday.Lam added there should be fewer restrictions for visits at care homes. while such facilities could copy the model of local tours in which groups head out to country parks under  closed-loop  arrangements.In an earlier segment of the same radio programme that Yiu joined. government pandemic adviser Professor David Hui Shu-cheong echoed calls to further ease restrictions. saying the move could be made in two weeks if there was no infection spike from the ongoing rugby Sevens tournament. The chances of a sharp surge are not high.  Hui said. citing the city s overall vaccination rate and immunity in the population from waves of earlier infections.The tournament. which will run until Sunday. has been billed as a major event marking the reopening of Hong Kong. alongside the recently concluded FinTech Week and Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit.Hui said it might take two weeks to find out whether the city would come out on top following infection risks posed by the string of mega events this week. He noted the number of imported coronavirus cases had remained  stable  even with hotel quarantine measures dropped. adding:  There is more room for relaxation. Hong Kong on Saturday recorded 5.111 Covid-19 infections. 494 of which were imported. and 18 additional related deaths. The city s tally stands at 1.942.707 cases and 10.457 fatalities.On vaccination for toddlers. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi-yan urged parents to be proactive in taking advantage of the newly available BioNTech formula.The arrival of the specially diluted vaccine was first unveiled by health officials on Thursday. with authorities saying on Saturday the shots would be offered at Hong Kong Children s Hospital in Kowloon and Gleneagles Hospital on Hong Kong Island.Parents hoping to inoculate their children in the New Territories can make bookings at CUHK Medical Centre in Sha Tin and Osman Ramju Sadick Memorial Sports Centre in Kwai Chung.Hong Kong eases Covid jab rules for primary. secondary full-day classes to resume Children have weaker resistance to diseases and can fall into severe conditions should they get infected with the Covid-19 virus. They may also develop medium- to long-term after-effects following recovery.  she warned.The latest German-produced BioNTech shot can be given to children aged six months to under five years and parents are advised to leave an eight-week gap between the first and second jabs. although this period can be shortened to three weeks subject to personal needs. The third dose should be administered at least three months after the second. according to the government.Currently. only the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine is available to children as young as six months.As of Saturday. 18.7 per cent of children under two years of age and 66.8 per cent of those between three and 11 years had received a first dose of the Sinovac vaccine. Another 20.3 per cent of those aged five to 11 years had received their first BioNTech shot.Meanwhile. the Hospital Authority adjusted to the back-to-work arrangement for staff identified as close contacts of a Covid-19 case. under which employees are expected to return to work the next day the earliest if they receive a negative result on a rapid antigen test and are asymptomatic and physically fit. It will take effect from November 9.A spokesman for the authority said it adjusted the measure due to a possible surge in demand for medical services as the city faced the winter flu season. After considering demand for medical staff during the pandemic and the influenza season. and balancing infectious risks. the Hospital Authority has decided to revise the relevant work arrangements.  it said.But staff should undergo PCR tests in the first six day of being identified as a close contact and they are required to wear respirators during work hours and eat alone. according to the authority.Additional reporting by William Yiu,Business News
Hong Kong residents who were born in 2009 or after should be banned from buying cigarettes by 2027. government advisers have proposed. as they recommended a basket of measures to further shrink the smoking population.The idea of creating a  smoke-free generation  by the end of the five-year term of the new administration was proposed by the Council on Smoking and Health on Thursday.It means that when this group of residents reach 18 years old in 2027 or later. they will not be allowed to buy tobacco products. It can help achieve the ‘tobacco endgame .  council chairman Henry Tong Sau-chai said.  We hope it can be achieved before the current government finishes its term. New Zealand has adopted the same approach. banning anyone born in 2008 or after from purchasing cigarettes.The city s smoking population dropped below double-digits last year for the first time since tracking began. hitting 9.5 per cent. but Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged in his maiden policy address last year to lower the rate to 7.8 per cent in three years.The Health Bureau is expected to unveil its plan for stronger tobacco controls for public consultation early next year.Other measures proposed by the statutory body included doubling the current tobacco tax by 2023-24. which means a pack of cigarettes currently priced at HK$60 would rise to around HK$100.Hong Kong may once again allow some types of e-cigarette re-exports It is the most effective way to achieve the government s key performance indicator.  the council s executive director Vienna Lai Wai-yin said.The council said the tax should be further raised in the following two years. so a pack of cigarettes would cost HK$200 eventually by 2025-26.Lai said he hoped the long-awaited tax increase would increase incentives for quitting smoking as the last time the government raised the tobacco tax by 11.8 per cent was in 2014.The council also recommended expanding the city s non-smoking areas to cover taxi and bus stands. as well as spaces that fall within 10 meters of hospitals. schools and community facilities.Hong Kong currently does not allow smoking on public transport. including its interchanges. in hospitals. schools. parks and indoor areas of restaurants. bars and malls.Regarding the Post s previous report about the government s consideration to reverse the ban on the re-export of e-cigarettes and other heated tobacco products as a means to boost the economy. Tong opposed the possible move.Malaysia redraws anti-smoking bill amid concerns over loss of rights It is against the intention of the legislation.  Tong said.  It will pass on bad values to children. Under the amended law which took effect in April. no one can import. sell or manufacture alternative smoking products such as electronic cigarettes. heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes.The legislation also prohibits smoking products from being transshipped through Hong Kong when brought in by truck or ship for transport onwards overseas. although air transshipment cargo and transit cargo that stays on a plane or ship are exempt.Tong worried that the reverse would create a  loophole  where alternative tobacco products would slip to the community.Lawmaker Shiu Ka-fai. representing the wholesale and retail sector. said poorer smokers would not be able to afford the product after the price rose. I agree with a reasonable tax increase by following the inflation rate. or else [the frozen tax] will sound like encouraging smoking. But if the increase deviates too much. it is a discrimination against the poor as the rich will not be affected.  Shiu said.He also opposed the idea of  smoke-free generation  as the policy would limit freedom of choice. It is true that the underage should not smoke cigarettes. but adults should have the freedom of choice instead of having the government make the decision for them.  he said.The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group. which is formed by smokers. said they opposed the tax hike as smokers might seek black-market cigarettes instead of quitting the habit. adding that it would impact the city s economic recovery.,Business News
An abnormal spate of melioidosis. a fatal infectious disease. in Hong Kong might have originated from the bacterium found in the soil on top of a reservoir in West Kowloon after a government investigation found the DNA profiles highly identical.Revealing the findings on Thursday. a top microbiologist leading the investigation said it was unknown how the bacterium had been passed on to the patients. stressing the city s fresh water supply was still safe. The tests conducted on water samples collected from the reservoir in Shek Kip Mei so far all tested negative.  Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong said.  All we know is that the DNA [of patients and soil samples] are almost the same. and the soil samples were collected on top of the reservoir. Caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soil. especially moist clay. and muddy water. melioidosis is an infectious disease with symptoms including fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.A total of 34 melioidosis cases have been found in Hong Kong this year. considered as unusual compared with previous years. with 23 detected in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven patients have died of the disease.Health authorities found that the cases in Sham Shui Po district were in the proximity of the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs. and a construction site at Pak Tin Estate.Among the 471 environmental samples obtained from the area. 38 of them contained the bacterium. with 32 being collected from the soil on top of the reservoirs. Four of the soil samples from the reservoir were genetically similar to the samples collected from the patients in the district.Hong Kong melioidosis outbreak: what is causing it and how can you stay safe?Yuen said the team could not tell how it spread despite conducting multiple inspections. but he highlighted several possibilities: bacterium entering the reservoir through the air vents; increase in water temperature lowering the chlorine levels in fresh water; more elderly people living in the Sham Shui Po district; and global warming increasing the volume of Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil.Apart from an earlier suggestion to increase the chlorine levels in water. the expert team also recommended the government install air filters at the air vents and some ultraviolet lamps at the reservoir.The chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. were raised last week in a bid to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicThe public. especially the elderly. was also advised to let the taps run for at least a minute before use and to boil water before drinking it. The investigation has come to an end at this stage.  Yuen said.  We have to accept that the disease has become endemic … the public need not be overly concerned if the cases do not share a common origin. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. of the Centre for Health Protection. said authorities were revising the laws to include melioidosis as a statutory notifiable disease. which meant doctors would have to report suspected or confirmed cases.Two cases of melioidosis were also reported at Eastern Hospital last month. Au said results of whole genome sequencing were different from the Sham Shui Po cluster. We believe that the two cases are not related to the Sham Shui Po cluster and are sporadic cases that are found locally from time to time.  he noted.Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen added that different genome sequencing results meant the cases did not have a common source of infection. therefore there was no cause for concern.Last week. 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin Estate who had chronic illnesses were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. Eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam said there might be multiple sources of infection including inhaling of contaminated soil or drinking of compromised water.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosis It is difficult to determine the actual transmission route. You can only raise suspicions as the samples collected around the reservoir [were positive].  he said.Lam warned that the residents living next to the reservoir who suffered from chronic illness. especially diabetes. should only use boiled water for drinking or brushing teeth.Respiratory medicine expert Dr Leung Chi-chiu suggested the authorities testing the elderly or those with chronic illnesses in Pak Tin Estate check whether they had been exposed as well.,Business News
A top Hong Kong microbiologist has retracted seven research papers published between eight to 18 years ago after image errors were discovered. but he insisted the mistakes did not affect research conclusions and had nothing to do with his work on severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) or the Covid-19 pandemic.Yuen Kwok-yung. 66. a chair professor of infectious diseases at the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and who discovered Sars. told the Post on Wednesday he had made a  supervisory oversight .He expressed regret over the use of some images for the seven journal articles involved. for which he was the team leader. As the last corresponding author of these research papers. I did commit a mistake which was a supervisory oversight … It s nobody s fault but mine.  he said. I regret what happened and have been doing everything possible to correct the scientific record according to the highest professional standards. Leading Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung gets Covid-19The microbiologist on August 1 decided to ask journal editors to retract the research papers the same day he got emails from an unknown party who alerted him about the similarity of some test strip images for Western Blot. a test to show whether some animals or humans had antibodies against a certain virus. bacteria or fungi.The articles for which Yuen was either the lead author or co-author involved antibody detection for a particular kind of virus. bacteria or fungi on animals or humans.They showed a compilation of images of the Western Blot test strips to indicate whether the subject had the relevant antibodies. Similar to the rapid antigen test for Covid-19. the test strip shows one line if the result is positive and no line if it is negative.One article was about the discovery of a novel bottlenose dolphin coronavirus. and another concerned the identification and genome analysis of three novel viruses in fruit bats from mainland China. After being alerted about the similarity of the images used. I immediately used a forensic image software to examine the images and I found some of them strikingly similar to the others.  Yuen said.  I believe some of the images had been mistakenly mixed up by my research team colleagues so I immediately called for the retraction of the research papers. The error in each paper might have been accidentally and unintentionally introduced by one of the co-authors 8 to 18 years ago.  he said.Yuen explained the errors were difficult to spot. except by image experts or specialist software. but at that time they did not have such advanced forensic image equipment to verify if the images had been reused.All the serum specimens and other samples had been discarded seven years after publication. so the experiments could not be repeated. he added. We have no choice but to retract these papers. despite the fact that the errors did not affect the main conclusions of the papers or management of patients.  Yuen said.Yuen emphasised that none of the papers were related to his mainstream research. such as the discovery of Sars. Covid-19 or Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).He said he had also informed HKU s faculty of medicine about the image errors and the retraction of the articles.Hong Kong health chief to weigh call for natural Covid immunity; 3.762 cases loggedYuen said the faculty had later carried out an investigation and decided he had made a  supervisory oversight . adding that. from now on. his team would screen all their publications with advanced image software.Yuen. who has published about 1.100 articles over 35 years. said he felt upset about the mistakes. but that he did not think they would affect his reputation. We used a period of six months to two years each for writing these retracted articles and. of course. I feel sad about the retraction.  he said. But nothing is more important than telling the truth. The most important thing is setting the scientific record straight. An HKU spokeswoman said the university had acknowledged a recent allegation that some images used in the seven papers were  more similar than expected . and it then set up an evaluation panel to review the cases in accordance with established procedures. After careful deliberation. the university has concluded that there was indeed some evidence of the alleged mistakes in handling images in the papers. The corresponding authors received an official reprimand for their mistakes in the respective research work.  she said.  The university will also be imposing sanctions on the responsible authors. The spokeswoman added HKU was committed to upholding the highest standards in research and integrity. All HKU researchers must be diligent and meticulous in their research endeavours and equip themselves with the best research practices to prevent similar incidents from happening again.  she said.,Business News
Hong Kong s former health secretary will lead a community care programme in which 1.000 nursing students will serve more than 10.000 elderly residents and educate them about online medical care services.The University of Hong Kong s school of nursing on Wednesday launched the pilot round of the Generations Connect Project under which more than 50 students will receive elderly care training and visit about 100 elderly residents living in Wah Fu Estate this month.Former secretary for health Sophia Chan Siu-chee. who now teaches at the university s school of nursing. is the director of the programme. In the midst of an ageing population. I think it is important that we have our students who are savvy in using digital health devices communicating with the elderly.  she said. And also in the midst of the Covid-19 [pandemic]. actually many elders have been stuck at home and do not go out. so therefore their psychosocial and physical well-being is being tarnished to a certain extent. So I think this programme is very timely in getting our students to communicate [with the elderly]. The project. sponsored by the Sino Group and Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation. will involve collaboration with 11 social welfare organisations in its second phase from January 2023 until the end of 2024.Almost one-third of Hong Kong elderly felt lonely during fifth Covid wave: surveyIn the second phase. more than 1.000 bachelor s and master s students at the school of nursing will work with 10.000 elderly residents in need across 18 districts in the city through regular home visits. phone calls and video conferences. in an effort to enhance their psychosocial and mental well-being. The project will also be integrated into various nursing courses.Students will teach such residents how to operate an online platform especially designed for the elderly to access health-related information. as well as how to use government e-health services. to increase their digital literacy.Chan said one of the project s aims was to promote primary healthcare. which focused on prevention measures and centred around the community. adding that some of the topics included encouraging the elderly to exercise. Under an ageing population … our nursing students and society as a whole have to face the fact that many of our residents are elderly.  she said. adding that the project would help the elderly build health habits that would prevent them from developing conditions that might add to the burden on the healthcare system.The project will also focus on increasing such residents  knowledge on Covid-19 prevention and evidence-based interventions.Data will also be collected during the initiative and analysed by the university. which will then publish reports and recommendations for the planning of elderly care services and nurse training. We hope we can do a good job in data analysis for the sake of the development of elderly services. preventive measures in the community and primary healthcare.  she said. We also wish to provide new [elderly care] models so that under the drastic change of the healthcare system. nurses can be well-prepared. as well as offering them demonstration and guidance during professional training.,Business News
Hong Kong has been dealing with a mysterious spate of melioidosis cases since August. with a cluster emerging in the Sham Shui Po district.The Post takes a look at what health authorities have found out so far and what residents should do about it.1. What is melioidosis?Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. which is abundant in soils. especially moist clay. and muddy water.It is usually spread through contact with contaminated soil or surface water. especially via skin abrasions and wounds. as well as inhaling contaminated dust or water droplets and drinking contaminated water. While person-to-person transmission is uncommon. it can happen through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected individual.Melioidosis can manifest as conditions such as a localised infection. pneumonia. meningoencephalitis and sepsis. which is an extreme response to infections where the immune system starts to attack healthy tissue. Depending on the location of infection. symptoms include fever. headache. cough. chest pain. ulceration and localised pain or swelling.The incubation period commonly ranges from two to four weeks. The fatality rate is between 40 and 75 per cent. It can be treated with antibiotics. but there is no vaccine targeting the bacteria.People with underlying diseases including diabetes. lung disease. liver disease. renal disease. cancer. or immunosuppression are more likely to be infected. Workers in agricultural. laboratory and healthcare are also susceptible to exposure.‘Vietnamese time bomb  disease: US deaths linked to Walmart aromatherapy sprayThe disease is considered endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It can also affect animals such as sheep. goats and pigs.2. How is the disease affecting Hong Kong?An abnormal number of melioidosis cases. 34 so far. have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. with 23 found in the Sham Shui Po district. Seven deaths were reported.The city logged 17 cases last year. An average of 10 cases have been detected each year over the past five years. according to official statistics.According to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). between August and October. 20 people. of which 16 were aged 60 or above. living in 19 blocks across Sham Shui Po were infected. They have no contact history with each other. The buildings are all located within a 1km radius of the Lee Cheng Uk and Pak Tin estates.Hong Kong logs spate of melioidosis cases. but experts urge public not to panicMost of the patients from the Kowloon cluster over the past three months were immunocompromised because of underlying diseases. according to the centre.Among the 26 workers from a construction site in Pak Tin estates who had chronic illnesses and were selected to undergo a test by the authorities. eight males and two females aged 39 to 66. all asymptomatic. were found to have antibodies against melioidosis bacteria on Saturday.It was believed that they might have had an asymptomatic infection in the past after being exposed to soil or water contaminated with the bacterium.3. Have the authorities found the cause of the outbreak?On October 21. the CHP revealed that DNA traces of the bacterium were found in the four soil samples from the construction site at Pak Tin Estate. but it could not be reproduced in a laboratory because of its low bacterial load. None of the infected people known at the time had worked. entered or walked near the area.After finding positive swab samples obtained from a water pipe and the surface of a flowerpot at a patient s home in Sham Shui Po. health authorities last Tuesday inspected the Shek Kip Mei and Butterfly Valley reservoirs in the district with University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung.Although no positive readings were reported during the inspection. Dr Albert Au Ka-wing. CHP s principal medical and health officer. said one direction of the investigation was whether the patients had drunk or come into contact with contaminated water.Considering another possibility of the spread. Yuen s team had also brought some cheap face masks from the district to see if they were contaminated.Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam previously said wind and rain might have brought the bacteria to the air. which was then breathed in by the patients.4. What did the government do to contain the spread?Health authorities announced a plan to make melioidosis a statutory notifiable disease. meaning doctors would be required to report cases to officials.The Water Supplies Department said last week it had increased chlorine levels at the Sha Tin Water Treatment Plant facility. the largest in the city. which services Sha Tin. Kowloon Central and part of Hong Kong Island. to kill the bacteria that might have caused the outbreak. It was also considering Yuen s suggestion of installing UV light to eliminate more bacteria.Hong Kong doctors may need to report melioidosis cases. 3 new patients confirmedCalcium hydroxide. which can be used as a disinfectant of the bacterium. was also added to the soil at the construction site at Pak Tin Estate to protect workers and those living nearby.5. Should we be worried?Respiratory disease specialist Dr Leung Chi-chiu said the chance of having a major outbreak was small as the disease was rarely transmitted from human to human.As 38 per cent of the workers tested were found to be infected. he believed that the contamination at the construction site was severe. adding that the 10 workers were unlikely to develop symptoms unless they were severely immunocompromised.He said it could not be ruled out that residents at the public housing estate were also heavily exposed. adding that the government should test high-risk residents to look at the infection rate.10 Hong Kong construction workers test positive for bacterium that causes melioidosisCiting previous studies. infectious diseases expert Lam noted that only a small number of people who come in contact with the bacterium causing melioidosis will suffer an infection.He said most patients were usually older. and there was no need to panic for healthy people with a normal level of immunity as they would not catch the disease after contact with low levels of the bacteria.He said the best way for people to protect themselves was to boost their immune systems.6. How should we protect ourselves?Infectious diseases expert Dr Wilson Lam warned all residents. regardless of their medical condition. against using or consuming unboiled water found near soil that could be contaminated.He said the public should also avoid using such water for other purposes such as washing. rinsing mouths or brushing teeth.He added that patients with chronic illnesses. especially diabetes. should be  extra careful .Melioidosis should be made notifiable to Hong Kong authorities. experts sayYuen also suggested the elderly as well as those with chronic illnesses run the tap for a minute first before using the water to brush their teeth. shower or drink.According to the CHP. the public can also take precautions such as wearing gloves and boots during activities that could involve contact with soil or water. washing or showering after exposure to possibly contaminated water or soil. cleaning wounds as soon as possible. covering cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings and washing hands with liquid soap after handling soils.Additional reporting by Harvey Kong,Business News
Hong Kong will host its second Asia global health summit following a string of other high-profile events this week. with professionals in the field from around the world outlining their views on how to create a sustainable post-Covid pandemic future for the sector.The summit. to be held on November 10 to 11. will be one of the highlights of the city s first International Healthcare Week. organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).Can Hong Kong s FinTech Week crypto announcements steal Singapore s thunder?HKTDC executive director Margaret Fong Shun-man on Monday said healthcare and life sciences had become a global concern since the pandemic. adding the event could help Hong Kong cement its leading position in the region s growing industry. From our work in promoting technology and medical devices over the years. we see that Hong Kong has considerable strengths in both the upstream and downstream elements of the healthcare. medical and life sciences ecosystem that can support the city in developing into a leading global healthcare and life sciences hub.  she said.

Hong Kong s new primary care authority will avoid becoming a  toothless tiger  if it cuts red tape and empowers community nurses to do more for patients. former health chief Sophia Chan Siu-chee has said.Now a professor of nursing at the University of Hong Kong. she said officials aiming to transform the city s health landscape must also act to woo nurses and retain talent. Last year alone. 2.600 nurses quit the public sector.Chan welcomed Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu s recent announcement of major reforms in the public health sector. including the creation of a new independent authority for primary care. It can t be a toothless tiger. primary care reforms are what the city has long awaited.  she told the Post. in her first media interview since leaving office earlier this year.Stressing the need for more funding too. she said:  In the long term. primary care can improve public health and reduce the burden on hospitals. But sometimes. you must invest first before you can reap the rewards. During her tenure as secretary for food and health. Chan was an advocate for increasing primary healthcare in the community. focused on raising awareness about health issues. disease prevention and management. and supportive care that all help to reduce the burden on public hospitals.7 key takeaways from Hong Kong leader John Lee s first policy addressSince 2019. district health centres and smaller  DHC expresses  have been set up in all 18 districts. offering a range of services from health assessments to promoting diet and exercise. help with managing chronic diseases and rehabilitation for stroke patients.The previous administration also promised a comprehensive primary care blueprint which Chan was involved with closely. but its publication was delayed partly by disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In his policy address on October 19. city leader Lee unveiled a raft of measures on primary care. the highlight being the creation of the new authority.Chan expected some teething problems. saying it could be hard to reshuffle existing primary care services. such as those for the elderly and women. and bring them under one roof at the authority.The changes would also affect many patients. especially the elderly who were used to going to a hospital to see a specialist. she said. For hospitals. transferring patients to community health centres involved extra paperwork.In promoting primary care. much would depend on whether staff at the community health services could show patients that they benefited from going there instead of to hospitals.Hong Kong s public hospitals to offer up to HK$6 million home loan to staff The burden on hospitals will remain the same if patients insist on queuing up there for various services.  Chan said.  So the local nurses have to act as health coaches and coordinators with power to send a patient back to a specialist if needed. Besides her academic duties at HKU. Chan also took on a new role advising university president Xiang Zhang on promoting community health and other priorities.Since leaving office. she has been spending time training and developing career paths to attract new talent to community nursing.She said community nurses needed different skills compared with those in hospitals. and had to communicate well as health coaches.Chan said she was pleased that Lee outlined plans to attract overseas-trained nurses. following on earlier reforms under her watch to woo foreign doctors. We have to break down barriers and obstacles and simplify entry procedures.  she said.Given the high attrition rate among nurses. she urged officials to look at allowing those trained overseas to work in Hong Kong without having to sit local exams and undergo internships.Hong Kong s scheme for foreign-trained doctors gets dozens of applicationsWith other plans such as a pilot scheme to subsidise residents being screened for chronic diseases. Chan said she understood the need for a  step-by-step  approach and guarding against the abuse of subsidies.Ultimately. however. she felt it was important to promote and entrench the shift to primary healthcare and emphasise the benefits for all. Even healthy people have risk factors they should be aware of. and the system should allow them to take control of their own health.  she said.,Business News
Hong Kong s health minister has moved to invalidate more than 20.000 coronavirus vaccination exemptions issued by seven doctors suspected of supplying fake certificates under new powers granted to him after the law was amended on Wednesday.A government spokesman said the medical certificates would officially become invalid from November 9. adding that the seven doctors could offer written representations to defend their cases before November 1.He also urged those who held invalidated certificates to consult doctors to ensure they either received inoculations or continued to enjoy the exemption. Anyone using a false instrument knowingly may contravene the Crimes Ordinance.  he warned. adding the maximum penalty upon conviction was 14 years  jail.  Members of the public are urged not to defy the law and not to use exemption certificates obtained through improper means. The announcement came hours after Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said that amending the law could ensure  sufficient legal basis  for the government to assume its duty in pandemic work.The government last week lost a legal battle on revoking the exemptions. with the High Court ruling the health secretary had no power to do so.Dismissing accusations the administration sought to override the judicial process. Lo said:  It s not whether the government wins or someone else wins. We have to make sure all citizens win in this battle against Covid. The legislative amendments that empower the health chief to void exemption certificates deemed to be problematic took effect on Wednesday under negative vetting – meaning lawmakers vote on them after they have taken effect – but authorities are facing a fresh round of legal challenges on wider Covid-19 policies.Hong Kong health chief will have power to nullify Covid exemptions from WednesdayFormer civil servant and serial litigant Kwok Cheuk-kin. who won a legal battle last week that prevented the government from invalidating the documents. told the Post he would lodge a wider judicial review on Thursday against the vaccine pass and Covid-19 risk-exposure  Leave Home Safe  app.Lo addressed lawmakers in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. a day after the government revealed it would not appeal against the court ruling but would instead amend the law to target the jab exemptions in question. The legislative [amendments] are to give sufficient legal basis for the government to assume our responsibilities in our anti-epidemic work.  Lo said in defence of the move.He was referring to amendments under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. which empowers authorities to make regulations  for the purposes of preventing. combating or alleviating the effects of the public health emergency and protecting public health .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeThe High Court ruled that the government did not have the legal power to cancel more than 20.000 medical certificates granted by doctors suspected of malpractice.Holders of the documents are exempted from the vaccine pass scheme requiring residents to have had three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter premises citywide such as restaurants or bars.Six doctors have been arrested on suspicion of issuing the exemptions without proper medical diagnosis. with a seventh practitioner still wanted by police.Retired civil servant Kwok Cheuk-kin meets the press after winning his legal challenge last week. Photo: Yik Yeung-manKwok on Wednesday said that if he won his potential legal challenge. society would no longer have to dwell on the issue  once and for all . I will challenge whether [vaccine pass policies] are necessary. Hongkongers can only access designated premises by using this app but people coming for the financial summit are not required to. This is against the Basic Law as residents are equal before the law.  he argued.He was referring to the Global Financial Leaders  Investment Summit. set for between November 1 and 3. during which attendees can visit designated venues despite the need to observe three days of medical surveillance – a wider discretion that ordinary inbound travellers are not entitled to.Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei-fun. an associate professor and administrative law specialist at City University of Hong Kong. argued that the government should appeal against the ruling. So I think this case deserves to go all the way to the Court of Final Appeal. so that clearer rationales can be laid down.  she said. In cases involving significant public interest. the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal had often ruled differently. Lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen. chairman of the centrist Third Side party. agreed. saying that the latest move gave the impression that the government wanted to  circumvent the judiciary .7 doctors accused of giving fake exemptions banned from Hong Kong vaccine schemeAlex Lam Chi-yau. of the concern group Hong Kong Patients  Voices. separately told a radio programme on Wednesday morning that while he acknowledged the government s power to amend legislation. authorities failed to show respect for individual rights when they overturned the court ruling.Calling the government move a spectacle. he said the 20.000 residents affected by the cancellation of exemptions had been taken on  a roller-coaster ride .He added while some had managed to get hold of separate exemptions later. they were still required under Hospital Authority rules to have had at least one vaccine jab. which could expose them to risks.Lawmaker Doreen Kong Yuk-foon – who previously said that there was lack of legal grounds for authorities to invalidate such a large number of certificates – urged the government to be more forthcoming in explaining the rationale behind the amendment to the law.She also expressed surprise the government had extended the vaccine pass scheme until next year. saying the measure would affect the city s road back to normality.,Business News
The highly transmissible XBB could become the next dominant strain of Covid-19 in Hong Kong. but the population s level of hybrid immunity should stave off severe illnesses. health experts have said.The city has recorded 140 XBB infections since an overseas traveller became the first known carrier on October 10. but the number still pales beside other cases involving dominant strains in the city. such as BA.4 or BA.5. They accounted for 95.1 per cent of local cases over the past two weeks. compared with less than 0.1 per cent involving XBB. XBB could be the next dominant strain in Hong Kong.  said Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai. a top infectious disease expert at the University of Hong Kong.  Nevertheless. XBB is a recombinant of BA 2.75 and 2.10.1. Most people in Hong Kong have been infected with Omicron BA.2 or BA.5 before. plus [they have] a very high vaccination rate. Therefore. [they have] very high hybrid immunity. The immunity. coupled with a lack of evidence showing XBB was more virulent than other strains. had led Hung to believe the threat it posed to residents was minimal even if it became the dominant one due to its high transmissibility. Therefore. it will not be a threat to the healthcare system in Hong Kong in the winter.  he said.But the potential of XBB to drive up infections had been demonstrated in Singapore. where the strain fuelled a surge to 60.000 cases for the week ending October 17. up from about 41.000 logged the week before. Authorities in the city state also said they expected the daily figure to peak at about 15.000 by mid-November.Singaporean officials said XBB was now the predominant subvariant circulating in the community. accounting for 54 per cent of local cases in the week to October 9. up from 22 per cent the previous week. The strain has popped up in at least 17 countries. including Australia. Japan and Denmark.In ‘post-Covid  Singapore. doctors warn against complacency as XBB cases surgeDr Gilman Siu Kit-hang. an associate professor at the department of health. technology and informatics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. said research on XBB had shown it was more capable of evading vaccine-derived protections than other known variants. but inoculation could stave off severe symptoms.The scholar also explained that while Hong Kong s recent fifth coronavirus wave was driven by the subvariant BA. 2. the early round of infections would provide  some immunity  against XBB.Hong Kong health officials renew push to sign up elderly for Covid jabsSiu added that the coronavirus was also likely to mutate. with more variants expected to emerge during the coming winter. This winter is the first winter since many places around the world returned to normal. Variants are expected to keep emerging.  he said.Dr Leung Chi-chiu. a respiratory disease specialist. said real-world evidence on the high transmissibility of the XBB strain was not yet available and cautioned against forming premature judgments regarding the subvariant. At this stage. the immune escape is based on laboratory experiments … This does not necessarily mean they have an actual growth advantage in the real world.  he said. referring to the ability of a virus to evade detection by antibodies.  There is as yet no danger signals of the rapid spread of such a variant in our community. Hong Kong is finally axing hotel quarantine – here s what you need to knowLeung also argued the emergence of strains such as XBB should not dissuade local authorities from fully reopening Hong Kong s borders and ending the three days of surveillance required under the government s  0+3  regime.,Business News
